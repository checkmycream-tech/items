    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>, this is a wonderful moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li>In fact I would say it works as well as OTC hydrocortisone creams which have a drug in it that isn&#x27;t the greatest for your skin or body.</li>
            <li>This is Amazing Lotion!!!</li>
            <li>best advice is to check the ingredients of everything you use for yourself and your family, as there might be some things that irritate your skin, or that of a family member, or friend.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, my allergy-prone skin loves it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>but this thing showed remarkable improvement in just two days of usage.</li>
            <li>it feels creamy and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I liked what they said on the packaging, and I especially liked most of the ingredients, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great stuff and safe too</li>
            <li>Very good lotion...... excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>and this is absolutely the best moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li>This lotion has been more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m guessing that it is because it has borage oil in it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to say....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see it, but I sure could feel it, and every time I wore short-sleeve blouses, I felt self-conscious.</li>
            <li>Then a friend of mine recomended Eucerin and it worked much much better.</li>
            <li>Doctors have prescribed me all sorts of steroid creams but this works much better.  </li>
            <li>I think I would use this more if it didn&#x27;t leave my hands oily.  </li>
            <li>I have to give it some time to soak in and then wipe my hands on a towel before touching anything or else, I leave fingerprints everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, light fragrance too, even though I buy the Fragrance-free one.</li>
            <li>Seems we all need to pay more attention to these things.</li>
            <li>/use there, and many products I no longer do use, because of what I found out.</li>
            <li>soaks in rapidly, is unscented (great for sensitive skin and those with eczema) and paraben free, and it just works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Best winter dry hand creme I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been the most successful lotion in resolving my eczema issues.</li>
            <li>Having lived in winter friendly climates most of my life, I&#x27;ve tried it everything</li>
            <li>It is great under mineral makeup foundation, helping the powder to both adhere better to my skin and also be less, well, powdery and more moist and natural-looking.</li>
            <li>stuff is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone I know, which is the highest praise I can think of for a product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fabulous in helping my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>When I switched to the ShiKai Borage Therapy Advanced Formula a few years ago, I found it was the best lotion I&#x27;d ever tried at moisturizing and stopping the itching.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it moisturizes deeply and stops the itching fast.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better, and as a woman over 50, I need this more than ever, as my skin is getting older and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lotion goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>so, I can&#x27;t really judge how good it works on my cracked hands because I don&#x27;t want to use it much.</li>
            <li>Borage Advanced therapy is the only lotion that helped my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>The skin on the back of my hands is also in much better shape--it is smoother and younger-looking.</li>
            <li>I would think they would be pleased with the instant results.</li>
            <li>Now it is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this one actually seems to help problem skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth, no cloying smell, sinks in quickly and relief for winter hands….</li>
            <li>I have had very dry skin most of my life</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the brand in general.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this after trying a sample that seemed to really help for the itching from Eczema.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>and I am very please.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>i buy the foot cream now, same formula, bigger tube, better price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Purified water, rooibos extract, safflower seed oil, glyceryl stearate (vegetable emulsifier), glycerin, jojoba seed oil, borage seed oil, cetyl alcohol (vegetable wax), colloidal oatmeal, vitamin E acetate, dimethicone, shea butter, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexyl glycerin.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However my hands have completely changed they are changing back into the original color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has taken two months of daily use, but my left elbow is now nearly as silky smooth as my right elbow.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this product locally because it was on sale and because I have used and loved other Shikai borage products.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s unscented, and it leaves my skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion because the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>Also, with the prime shipping on this, I had it on my doorstep in 48 hours for less than I would have paid driving across town to Super Supplements.</li>
            <li>These are small things, but a huge relief to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many different products, including steroid creams that seemed to just irritate the condition and make it worse.</li>

            <li> The effects last a long time.</li>
            <li> It has always driven me crazy &amp; no doctor has been able to help me with it.</li>
            <li> My left elbow was so rough and scaly</li>
            <li> In the winter, my hands get so dry they sometimes crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone that has dry skin problems.</li>

            <li> Her skin was so dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problems due to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam long ago.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother instantly with just a small dab.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the oatmeal in it that does this for me, and the combination of other oils.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer said, if this does not work for you, keep trying other lotions.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t even pronounce, much less trust.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use products that are organic and not full of chemicals</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product and the brand in general.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; factor.&lt;br /&gt;Its seems to do what it claims to do...</li>
            <li> Been struggling with eczema on my legs for the past one year. Tried all sorts of lotions, and creams, including steroidal gels.. but this thing showed remarkable improvement in just two days of usage. Nothing more to say....you&#x27;ll know when you use it if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I had an embarrassing problem. My left elbow was so rough and scaly it was like snakeskin. I couldn&#x27;t see it, but I sure could feel it, and every time I wore short-sleeve blouses, I felt self-conscious. But nothing I tried made a dent in the problem. Until I tried this lotion. I initially bought this product locally because it was on sale and because I have used and loved other Shikai borage products. I liked what they said on the packaging, and I especially liked most of the ingredients, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken two months of daily use, but my left elbow is now nearly as silky smooth as my right elbow. I no longer worry about how it looks. The skin on the back of my hands is also in much better shape--it is smoother and younger-looking. These are small things, but a huge relief to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, this is a wonderful moisturizer for the face. It is neither sticky nor greasy. It is great under mineral makeup foundation, helping the powder to both adhere better to my skin and also be less, well, powdery and more moist and natural-looking. My daughter loves this lotion too. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Purified water, rooibos extract, safflower seed oil, glyceryl stearate (vegetable emulsifier), glycerin, jojoba seed oil, borage seed oil, cetyl alcohol (vegetable wax), colloidal oatmeal, vitamin E acetate, dimethicone, shea butter, phenoxyethanol, and ethylhexyl glycerin.</li>

            <li> So far, this has been the most successful lotion in resolving my eczema issues. As a previous reviewer said, if this does not work for you, keep trying other lotions. We are all different. This works for me and I am very please.</li>
            <li> I have a small area of eczema on my shin that drives me crazy during the winter months. I&#x27;ve had no itching at all since I started using this lotion, and I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day. I like that it&#x27;s unscented, and it leaves my skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because the ingredients are natural.  Nothing harmful.  Nice smell.  I like a pump.  It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my hands get so dry they sometimes crack and bleed. I also have a son who gets horrible eczema outbreaks on his arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the answer for all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in rapidly, is unscented (great for sensitive skin and those with eczema) and paraben free, and it just works amazingly well. My poor chapped hands were almost healed within two days and it helps keep my son&#x27;s eczema under control when he remembers to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone I know, which is the highest praise I can think of for a product. Also, with the prime shipping on this, I had it on my doorstep in 48 hours for less than I would have paid driving across town to Super Supplements. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Having lived in winter friendly climates most of my life, I&#x27;ve tried it everything and this is absolutely the best moisturizer ever. The lotion soaked in quickly, left no oily residue and my skin stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I try this product for eczema. Alfter three months, still have the problem. Then a friend of mine recomended Eucerin and it worked much much better.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for my red, chapped hands.  I also use it on my feet.  My skin feels smoother instantly with just a small dab.  The 8 oz. size will last a long time.  I&#x27;d recommend this product definitely.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problems due to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam long ago. This lotion has been more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m guessing that it is because it has borage oil in it.  I recommend it for anyone that has dry skin problems. I would think they would be pleased with the instant results.</li>
            <li> I have had lichen simplex chronicus since 2006.  It has always driven me crazy &amp; no doctor has been able to help me with it. Doctors have prescribed me all sorts of steroid creams but this works much better.  It needs to be applied at least twice a day though.  I like how the product has no scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff fixes dry skin, without being too greasy and without drying into sticky glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is soothing and reduces any itching.</li>
            <li> I think I would use this more if it didn&#x27;t leave my hands oily.  I have to give it some time to soak in and then wipe my hands on a towel before touching anything or else, I leave fingerprints everywhere.  so, I can&#x27;t really judge how good it works on my cracked hands because I don&#x27;t want to use it much. I will finish the 8 oz I bought and not buy another.  it feels creamy and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fabulous in helping my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Borage Advanced therapy is the only lotion that helped my grand daughter. Her skin was so dry and scaly. Now it is smooth and soft. Would recommend highly</li>
            <li> Very good lotion...... excellent for dry skin. Had surgery and the dry skin was really bad, after using Borage dryness when away.</li>
            <li> Best winter dry hand creme I&#x27;ve ever used. i buy the foot cream now, same formula, bigger tube, better price. Smooth, no cloying smell, sinks in quickly and relief for winter hands…. Use this stuff 4 times a day and I bet you get your hands back. i did.</li>
            <li> My long-time search for quality unscented skin care products is over. Shikai stuff rocks! Try their face, feet, and body lotions.</li>
            <li> This is Amazing Lotion!!! It has cured my eczema/dermatitis on my hands! I&#x27;m a hair dresser and my hands are constantly in water and hair products. I&#x27;ve had terrible itchy hives, and cracking, raw, bleeding skin on my hands and this lotion cured it! I was ready to quit working because my skin condition was very painful and wouldn&#x27;t heal. I tried many different products, including steroid creams that seemed to just irritate the condition and make it worse. With this Borage lotion my skin improved in a matter of days (seemed like over night)! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry skin most of my life and I&#x27;ve tied just about every lotion, cream and oil on the market. I prefer to use products that are organic and not full of chemicals you can&#x27;t even pronounce, much less trust. Greasiness and fragrances are a no-no for me too. When I switched to the ShiKai Borage Therapy Advanced Formula a few years ago, I found it was the best lotion I&#x27;d ever tried at moisturizing and stopping the itching. It&#x27;s the oatmeal in it that does this for me, and the combination of other oils. I know it&#x27;s not organic and there are somethings in it I&#x27;d prefer to avoid, but some times I have to compromise to get the relief I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. It has a nice, light fragrance too, even though I buy the Fragrance-free one. Best of all, it moisturizes deeply and stops the itching fast. The effects last a long time. My skin feels so much better, and as a woman over 50, I need this more than ever, as my skin is getting older and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best advice is to check the ingredients of everything you use for yourself and your family, as there might be some things that irritate your skin, or that of a family member, or friend. Seems we all need to pay more attention to these things. To do this, go to ewg.org/skindeep and type the product name in the search bar. If it doesn&#x27;t show up, try it anther way, use the categories on the left side too. If you still can&#x27;t find it, it&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t gotten to testing it yet, or to putting it in their database yet. I&#x27;ve found just about everything I used/use there, and many products I no longer do use, because of what I found out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this one actually seems to help problem skin. Highly recommended! Great ingredients, my allergy-prone skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and safe too</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! My hands were covered in eczema. To the point where they had changed in color and cracked . I was so embarrassed to shake hands prepare food etc. However my hands have completely changed they are changing back into the original color. I would def recommend this product to any one suffering from eczema psoriasis whatever, give it a try.</li>
