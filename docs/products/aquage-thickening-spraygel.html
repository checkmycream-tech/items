            <li>I have tried everything on the market, grocery store to department store, you will not find anything better than this product.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t provide the volume I was looking for but did make my hair more manageable for heat styling and reduced some flyaways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a jet than a mist, which means you have to spray in more than you would otherwise.</li>

            <li>it keeps the curl perfectly - I LOVE this product</li>

            <li>I am so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love at once because I noticed my hair had volume, but was not flattened because of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the gel on damp hair and blow-dried for all over volume and have also tried the&amp;#34;use fingers to apply to roots&amp;#34;method for more of a spot booster for my shorter, spiky hair.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>pretty good stuff for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It works great in shaping your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>It has a great amount of hold, it smells nice and lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up.  </li>
            <li>is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It improved the texture of my hair and made it easy to style.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it would weigh my hair down, but it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>plus is that it smells great although not a heavy scent that overpowers the rest of you, just clean.</li>
            <li>I have fine,</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product did not do anything to thicken my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>My fine hair holds its shape and there is no evidence of hair product when I am finished.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine limp hair</li>
            <li>It becomes more fresh looking</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It is like a light gel that sprays on.  </li>
            <li>As you age, your hair gets thinner, but this wonderful product has given new life back to my hair!  </li>
            <li>Usually this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon and will probably use it as long as they carry it.  </li>
            <li>Originally I found this and was recommended for me from a salon in Arizona.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It disappears -- you have no sense that you used it all -- but your hair is light, full, and silky, and it lasts until you shampoo again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the hardest holding product I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s adequate and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two really thicken and texturize my hair with a quick blowdry.  </li>
            <li>I always buy more before I completely run out because I can&#x27;t imagaine being without!</li>
            <li>Then I do another quick blow to make sure it dries completely.</li>
            <li>I have very silky fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was thick and full and I loved the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the extra fullness it adds to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Well worth price.</li>
            <li>I use this with towel dry hair and blow dry it &amp; it works perfect!</li>
            <li>My hair used to fall right over.</li>
            <li>It also gives just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>I have a very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Although my hair was full already, I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add more once my hair was finished and dry.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have fine, soft hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Sprayed on damp hair rite before blowdrying &amp; it really improves my hair texture, it feels thicker &amp; is easier to style!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything like it!  </li>
            <li>Gives body and shine and looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li>This product was first used on my by my hairdresser</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite but not a big deal.</li>
            <li>First, I thank my sister for introducing me to \\&quot;product,\\&quot; as they say in the South.</li>
            <li>Aquage thickening spraygel does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>after I blowdry it or use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>No flaking of product if you use to much!</li>
            <li>As a girl with naturally curly hair you would think that I would be easy to please and impress with another hair product that promises the world and neglects to inform us that the world is comprised of women with straight and well behaved hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean fragrance and no white flakes left after it dries.</li>
            <li>Although I was a bit scared of any reversion that might occur when a gel or spray is usually applied on freshly flat ironed curly hair, I took the plunge anyway, and it worked perfectly-</li>
            <li>I normally do not like spraygels , but this sprays very fine &amp; adds alot of body to my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a light gel that gives my short hair just the right amount of body to style.</li>
            <li>Very timely delivery, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have very thin/fine hair, and after several uses to figure out how much product to use, I love this.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dry my hair out which has been a problem for me with most volumizing/thickening products.  </li>
            <li>I have used countless hair products to control my fine straight hair but gels and mousses don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to increase the appearance of the volume of their hair.</li>
            <li>I think I have tried just about every thickening product on the market and none of them really worked -</li>
            <li>I do really like the scent and the container</li>
            <li>I really like this gel.</li>
            <li>Straight.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This works really well with the KMS California Freeshape spray.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium coarse wavy hair and, as a busy mom of 2 boys, there are many days that I don&#x27;t have time to fix my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one because even though the price was a bit high, the ratings were also very high.</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine, thin hair and most thickening sprays make my hair feel like cardboard.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I need a product to help punch it up a little.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and goes flat easily, though I have a fair bit of it.</li>
            <li>I love this spray gel because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy hair and this give a lot more definition.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, poker straight, bodiless hair, and it makes it look full and the style lasts through any kind of wind or activity.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I thought it would be more light weight but still leaves my hair a tad on the heavy side if I use a tad too much.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for thin hair!</li>
            <li>I was unable to find it at Target, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is more manageable and responds well to a blow dryer or air dried.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine slick hair with not body at all.</li>
            <li>still leaves hair soft, yet a little more managable.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does give my fine hair body with out the alcohol or harshness of other products.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it holds without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>First time using this product and I can&#x27;t say enough about the product.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair appear to be thicker and it makes my hair feel soft!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually thickens my hair!</li>
            <li>This product is light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li>I should first start off by saying that i&#x27;m an african-american woman with naturally curly hair that flat irons my hair and wears it straight regularly.</li>
            <li>I also use a little bit of Aquage Uplifting Foam on my roots to give some extra lift - I love it too</li>
            <li>This is an amazing &amp;#34;curl booster&amp;#34; for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I need a spraygel that will completely change the texture of my wayward locks.  </li>
            <li>After blowdrying and straight ironing my hair, it actually feels and looks thicker!</li>
            <li>It made my hair too soft and flyaway...</li>
            <li>Sometimes instead of spraying it directly on my hair, I will spray it in my palm and apply it with my fingertips.</li>
            <li>It gives me a style that last thru out the day, and washes completely out when I shampoo, no residue whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li>--I love the way it works, not too stiff but definitely adds volume.</li>
            <li>They looked pretty much the same (blue colour and some of the same ingredients) but that is where the similarity ended.</li>
            <li>Too many and my hair falls flat and heavy, not enough and my hair is too soft to style.</li>
            <li>I am cursed with hair that alternated between having the texture of a sheep&#x27;s wool that is well past time for shearing or hair that is so heavily weighted by its own oily juices that I resemble someone that has been on a three day binge.  </li>
            <li>It really gives life to my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li>and this gel is just the right consistency and weight to take away the &amp;#34;alfalfa sprouts&amp;#34; without weighing it down so that it looks flat.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your hair and adds volume.</li>
            <li>Soft is fun to touch, but not good for styling.</li>
            <li>I can even wake up the next morning, fluff my hair and ready to go with only minor touchups.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different products for a very long time for thin hair and this seems to be the top product for me.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on my hair which is fine and thin</li>
            <li>Just a little massaged in damp hair and blown out really makes a big difference.</li>

            <li> Aqua Thickening Spraygel works great on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this spray gel would do amazing things for my hair, but it didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I got this from my hair stylist and really liked it.</li>

            <li> And I am so happy to get it so quickly thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Light but provides good control and body.</li>

            <li> I am a senior citizen and have used many hair products over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love Aquage products though and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market, grocery store to department store, you will not find anything better than this product.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t provide the volume I was looking for but did make my hair more manageable for heat styling and reduced some flyaways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a jet than a mist, which means you have to spray in more than you would otherwise.</li>
            <li> Really love how this feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> it keeps the curl perfectly - I LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aquage products for almost 20 years, I am still in love after all this time.  </li>

            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love at once because I noticed my hair had volume, but was not flattened because of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the gel on damp hair and blow-dried for all over volume and have also tried the&amp;#34;use fingers to apply to roots&amp;#34;method for more of a spot booster for my shorter, spiky hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> would be better if it added more shine</li>

            <li> Love this stuff for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> pretty good stuff for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works great in shaping your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> It has a great amount of hold, it smells nice and lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up.  </li>
            <li> is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It improved the texture of my hair and made it easy to style.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it would weigh my hair down, but it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> plus is that it smells great although not a heavy scent that overpowers the rest of you, just clean.</li>
            <li> I have fine,</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product did not do anything to thicken my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> My fine hair holds its shape and there is no evidence of hair product when I am finished.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine limp hair</li>
            <li> It becomes more fresh looking</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It is like a light gel that sprays on.  </li>
            <li> As you age, your hair gets thinner, but this wonderful product has given new life back to my hair!  </li>
            <li> Usually this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it on Amazon and will probably use it as long as they carry it.  </li>
            <li> Originally I found this and was recommended for me from a salon in Arizona.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It disappears -- you have no sense that you used it all -- but your hair is light, full, and silky, and it lasts until you shampoo again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the hardest holding product I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s adequate and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two really thicken and texturize my hair with a quick blowdry.  </li>
            <li> I always buy more before I completely run out because I can&#x27;t imagaine being without!</li>
            <li> Then I do another quick blow to make sure it dries completely.</li>
            <li> I have very silky fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was thick and full and I loved the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the extra fullness it adds to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Well worth price.</li>
            <li> I use this with towel dry hair and blow dry it &amp; it works perfect!</li>
            <li> My hair used to fall right over.</li>
            <li> It also gives just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> I have a very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Although my hair was full already, I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add more once my hair was finished and dry.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have fine, soft hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Sprayed on damp hair rite before blowdrying &amp; it really improves my hair texture, it feels thicker &amp; is easier to style!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything like it!  </li>
            <li> Gives body and shine and looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li> This product was first used on my by my hairdresser</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> First, I thank my sister for introducing me to \\&quot;product,\\&quot; as they say in the South.</li>
            <li> Aquage thickening spraygel does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> after I blowdry it or use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> No flaking of product if you use to much!</li>
            <li> As a girl with naturally curly hair you would think that I would be easy to please and impress with another hair product that promises the world and neglects to inform us that the world is comprised of women with straight and well behaved hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean fragrance and no white flakes left after it dries.</li>
            <li> Although I was a bit scared of any reversion that might occur when a gel or spray is usually applied on freshly flat ironed curly hair, I took the plunge anyway, and it worked perfectly-</li>
            <li> I normally do not like spraygels , but this sprays very fine &amp; adds alot of body to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a light gel that gives my short hair just the right amount of body to style.</li>
            <li> Very timely delivery, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have very thin/fine hair, and after several uses to figure out how much product to use, I love this.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my hair out which has been a problem for me with most volumizing/thickening products.  </li>
            <li> I have used countless hair products to control my fine straight hair but gels and mousses don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to increase the appearance of the volume of their hair.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried just about every thickening product on the market and none of them really worked -</li>
            <li> I do really like the scent and the container</li>
            <li> I really like this gel.</li>
            <li> Straight.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This works really well with the KMS California Freeshape spray.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse wavy hair and, as a busy mom of 2 boys, there are many days that I don&#x27;t have time to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one because even though the price was a bit high, the ratings were also very high.</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine, thin hair and most thickening sprays make my hair feel like cardboard.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I need a product to help punch it up a little.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and goes flat easily, though I have a fair bit of it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray gel because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair and this give a lot more definition.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, poker straight, bodiless hair, and it makes it look full and the style lasts through any kind of wind or activity.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I thought it would be more light weight but still leaves my hair a tad on the heavy side if I use a tad too much.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it at Target, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is more manageable and responds well to a blow dryer or air dried.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine slick hair with not body at all.</li>
            <li> still leaves hair soft, yet a little more managable.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and does give my fine hair body with out the alcohol or harshness of other products.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it holds without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I can&#x27;t say enough about the product.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair appear to be thicker and it makes my hair feel soft!  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually thickens my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I should first start off by saying that i&#x27;m an african-american woman with naturally curly hair that flat irons my hair and wears it straight regularly.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit of Aquage Uplifting Foam on my roots to give some extra lift - I love it too</li>
            <li> This is an amazing &amp;#34;curl booster&amp;#34; for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I need a spraygel that will completely change the texture of my wayward locks.  </li>
            <li> After blowdrying and straight ironing my hair, it actually feels and looks thicker!</li>
            <li> It made my hair too soft and flyaway...</li>
            <li> Sometimes instead of spraying it directly on my hair, I will spray it in my palm and apply it with my fingertips.</li>
            <li> It gives me a style that last thru out the day, and washes completely out when I shampoo, no residue whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li> --I love the way it works, not too stiff but definitely adds volume.</li>
            <li> They looked pretty much the same (blue colour and some of the same ingredients) but that is where the similarity ended.</li>
            <li> Too many and my hair falls flat and heavy, not enough and my hair is too soft to style.</li>
            <li> I am cursed with hair that alternated between having the texture of a sheep&#x27;s wool that is well past time for shearing or hair that is so heavily weighted by its own oily juices that I resemble someone that has been on a three day binge.  </li>
            <li> It really gives life to my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> and this gel is just the right consistency and weight to take away the &amp;#34;alfalfa sprouts&amp;#34; without weighing it down so that it looks flat.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your hair and adds volume.</li>
            <li> Soft is fun to touch, but not good for styling.</li>
            <li> I can even wake up the next morning, fluff my hair and ready to go with only minor touchups.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products for a very long time for thin hair and this seems to be the top product for me.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair which is fine and thin</li>
            <li> Just a little massaged in damp hair and blown out really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (actual curly, not wavy curly) and use this to tame my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle doesn&#x27;t distribute the gel very well.</li>
            <li> I buy the small bottle for travel and the large bottle for refill.</li>
            <li> I have found that partially drying my hair, spritzing a small amount into my hand and then running through my hair before I finish drying is just right.  </li>
            <li> I need product in my hair to get some body and fullness, otherwise it lies flat.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, but it works great and lasts without making your hair clump or get dirty</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and live in Florida (not a good match), however using the Aquage line, I have nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy when my hair stylist of about 20 years (whom I still love) no longer carried this product due to low demand and perhaps high price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, and this still gives me volume, even at the roots, you just have to finger comb it, especially at the roots, when its almost dry until it is dry.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - my hair has been long and is now medium length -  </li>
            <li> Can use on wet hair before drying and using irons and such.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> When I dry my hair, I experience nothing but softness, hold, and manageability.  </li>
            <li> Just spray in your wet hair and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> On the bottle, it says that you can apply it on wet and/or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, silky, stick straight hair that is impossible to style, much less have volume.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> I need something to fluff it up all day and make it \\&quot;swing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I applied it after a shower to wet hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps my thin hair</li>
            <li> I applied  it to my wet hair, blow dried, and flat ironed it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, a few short pumps on all sides then comb through!</li>
            <li> (You ladies know what I mean by the white flakes that are left by other products</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my other products.</li>
            <li> It made my hair stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> It adds volume without making my hair look sticky or dark.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it gummy.</li>
            <li> Yor hair will not be stiff, crunchy, or sticky using this product on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, straight hair and</li>
            <li> Unlike previous bottles, the liquid in this bottle is milky.  </li>
            <li> When my hair looks shaggy, I just spray n scrunch a little.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combination with a little bit of Eufora Beautifying Serum oil (also discontinued by my stylist and now purchased through Amazon) just on the ends to prevent split ends</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want any product that is heavy.  </li>
            <li> It adds body but isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays of this and my hair feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have flat, thin hair and that is the way it stayed with this.  </li>
            <li> mot being stiff like hairspray.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gives my hair body and texture without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I started ordering this product from Amazon, because it is not easy to find this in the places I shop.</li>
            <li> no static electricity since I&#x27;ve been using either, which in the winter with fine hair can be brutal.</li>
            <li> but sorry guys, your spray gel smelled funny and it left a really bad coating on my hair.</li>
            <li> but I am not really sure what it is.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why?</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this product i have not had problems after washing hair as in the past.</li>
            <li> Works well and does not  make my hair stiff and dull.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a hair product that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> But the alternative she provided was not nearly as good as this one is.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as the reviews were very promising.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 10 years, first time it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my Nick Chavez Plump N&#x27; Thick Spray Gel!</li>
            <li> Thin.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> My husband and I use as it makes thin hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> This last one was awful.</li>
            <li> This was merely another zero.</li>
            <li> It will be a bad hair day indeed.</li>
            <li> I like it but a tad disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product was exactly what I wanted.  Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> Love this for styling shaping and mot being stiff like hairspray.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and keep reordering it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have been using it for the last year.  It does not dry your hair and adds volume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  When my hair looks shaggy, I just spray n scrunch a little.  It becomes more fresh looking and I can go again</li>
            <li> Very timely delivery, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is simply a great product !!!</li>
            <li> I normally do not like spraygels , but this sprays very fine &amp; adds alot of body to my hair. Sprayed on damp hair rite before blowdrying &amp; it really improves my hair texture, it feels thicker &amp; is easier to style! Like all of the Aquage products I have tried it seams to improve the condition of my hair and does not cause product build up, Love it!</li>
            <li> I started ordering this product from Amazon, because it is not easy to find this in the places I shop. I have fine, thinning hair and this spray gel gives me the lift and body I need.  Plus with it being a spray it goes on evenly. Sure hope it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> This works great!&lt;br /&gt;Great price. Delivered in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and have used many hair products over the years.  As you age, your hair gets thinner, but this wonderful product has given new life back to my hair!  It is more manageable and responds well to a blow dryer or air dried.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to increase the appearance of the volume of their hair.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried just about every thickening product on the market and none of them really worked - and then I found Aquage and their Thickening Spraygel. Absolutely the best hair product I have ever tried. I have very fine slick hair with not body at all. This stuff gives my hair body and texture without being stiff or sticky. You don&#x27;t have to use alot at all so the bottle should last. Well worth price. I also use a little bit of Aquage Uplifting Foam on my roots to give some extra lift - I love it too but if I had to choose just one, it would be the Thickening Spraygel.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have very thin, straight hair and using aquage definitely makes my hair look and feel thicker.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Love the extra fullness it adds to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products for a very long time for thin hair and this seems to be the top product for me. It gives my hair just enough body without any residue after drying and does not seem to build up. Washes out well each washing.</li>
            <li> Good experience  will use this company again</li>
            <li> I like it but a tad disappointed.  After reading the other reviews I thought it would be more light weight but still leaves my hair a tad on the heavy side if I use a tad too much.  I love Aquage products though and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the Aquage products and when received they were in the same bottle but the product inside was not the product I ordered. It was discolored and had a different soapy type smell. I contacted the company and they gave me a refund promptly with no questions or offer to replace item.</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Light but provides good control and body.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product did not do anything to thicken my hair</li>
            <li> Wife loves it...but I am not really sure what it is.  I know it&#x27;s a hair product that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> This spray gel is the best out there. I love it! It gives me hold without the stiffness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> This is truly a good product.  Holds the style when blown out, volume.  Excellent.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Made my hair thicker and gave it body and easier to control.  Helped with&lt;br /&gt;flyaway hair and bed head too.</li>
            <li> I started buying this product through my hairdresser, but I&#x27;ve moved and thankful I can find it here.  Ladies, I LOVE this product. I have medium coarse wavy hair and, as a busy mom of 2 boys, there are many days that I don&#x27;t have time to fix my hair. With this product, I can spray it in and go.  Yor hair will not be stiff, crunchy, or sticky using this product on wet hair.  This is what sealed the deal for me!!  When I dry my hair, I experience nothing but softness, hold, and manageability.  This product will last 3-6 months.  I have tried everything on the market, grocery store to department store, you will not find anything better than this product.  If you want hold, softness, and manageability with no stiffness, crunchiness, or stickiness; this product is for you!!!  Once you try it, you won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This product is light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  My hair is baby fine and I don&#x27;t want any product that is heavy.  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Usually this product is wonderful.  This last one was awful. not even useable.  I have used this product for about 10 years, first time it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I have very thin/fine hair, and after several uses to figure out how much product to use, I love this.  Not sticky, doesn&#x27;t frizz hair out, no static electricity since I&#x27;ve been using either, which in the winter with fine hair can be brutal. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, and this still gives me volume, even at the roots, you just have to finger comb it, especially at the roots, when its almost dry until it is dry.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair which is fine and thin and it really makes a huge difference.  It adds body but isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky.  It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up.  Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I can&#x27;t say enough about the product.  It works beautifully.  I have very thin, poker straight, bodiless hair, and it makes it look full and the style lasts through any kind of wind or activity.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before I had this product.  It adds volume without making my hair look sticky or dark.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, been using it for a couple of years.  I have fine hair and it holds without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never tried anything like this, so it was a surprise how it works with my hair. It gives me a style that last thru out the day, and washes completely out when I shampoo, no residue whatsoever!!! A little goes a long way, a few short pumps on all sides then comb through!</li>
            <li> I used to use this all the time, then the place I got it went to a different line &amp; I kept trying to find something to replace this. I was so happy to find it on Amazon and will probably use it as long as they carry it.  It is a light gel that gives my short hair just the right amount of body to style.</li>
            <li> I started using this a year ago and my grandson ask me what I had on my hair as he loved the smell.  It works great in shaping your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It makes my hair look thicker and gives it tons of body.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product in her salon but stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;ve been buying it from Amazon since and this product works good on thinning hair.  It makes my hair fuller and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> All of Aquage products are great. I have very thin and fine hair. This product also works great with Aquage volumizing treatment.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t provide the volume I was looking for but did make my hair more manageable for heat styling and reduced some flyaways. I do really like the scent and the container is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing &amp;#34;curl booster&amp;#34; for thin hair.  Originally I found this and was recommended for me from a salon in Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything like it!  Very light weight.  I buy the small bottle for travel and the large bottle for refill.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair!  Does not weigh hair down. Gives body and shine and looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li> A great thickening spray-gel</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my fine hair. I have used countless hair products to control my fine straight hair but gels and mousses don&#x27;t do much. This product was first used on my by my hairdresser and I loved it from the start. Nice clean fragrance and no white flakes left after it dries. (You ladies know what I mean by the white flakes that are left by other products I&#x27;m sure.)</li>
            <li> hubby is very happy with this gel he likes the ease of the spray bottle and the fact that it thickens the look of his thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Aquage products are great.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel. It has a great amount of hold, it smells nice and lasted me a long time. I have curly hair (actual curly, not wavy curly) and use this to tame my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle doesn&#x27;t distribute the gel very well. It&#x27;s more of a jet than a mist, which means you have to spray in more than you would otherwise.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here but I did not like this spray gel at all! I&#x27;m sure that Aquage is a good company with great products but sorry guys, your spray gel smelled funny and it left a really bad coating on my hair. I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it after I sprayed it on my damp hair. I&#x27;ll stick to my Nick Chavez Plump N&#x27; Thick Spray Gel! They looked pretty much the same (blue colour and some of the same ingredients) but that is where the similarity ended. When you find something you like, stick with it...lesson learned...</li>
            <li> Adds lots of texture and hold to hard-to-hold hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Unlike previous bottles, the liquid in this bottle is milky.  I am not sure why?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about tow years now and find it is the best holding product for my fine hair. I will buy it as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> OMG - finally something that actually works! I&#x27;ve tried a number of different thickening sprays and this is the only one that actually works. I use it as both a thickening spray and to define my curls - I have slightly wavy hair and this give a lot more definition. And it smells great!</li>
            <li> Happy with this product line. Really love how this feels in my hair. Would recommend this to anyone. Smells great too!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - my hair has been long and is now medium length -  it keeps the curl perfectly - I LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those women who&#x27;ve come to terms with truly &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; hair - the trifecta of woe.  Thin. Fine. Straight.  Their shampoo seems to help, but I&#x27;ll tell you what you MUST pair it with - Aquage spray thickening gel.  This stuff is awesome!  Just a little massaged in damp hair and blown out really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> Perfect light spray gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aquage products for almost 20 years, I am still in love after all this time.  I have natural curly hair and live in Florida (not a good match), however using the Aquage line, I have nothing to worry about.  I constantly receive compliments on my curls.  I also trust this seller for receiving the real thing, will buy more!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but it works great and lasts without making your hair clump or get dirty</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair used to fall right over. I use this with towel dry hair and blow dry it &amp; it works perfect! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine, thin hair and most thickening sprays make my hair feel like cardboard.  This makes my hair appear to be thicker and it makes my hair feel soft!  Very, very awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.  I have found that partially drying my hair, spritzing a small amount into my hand and then running through my hair before I finish drying is just right.  My fine hair holds its shape and there is no evidence of hair product when I am finished.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my stylist used it on my hair in the salon. I fell in love at once because I noticed my hair had volume, but was not flattened because of product. I&#x27;ve used the gel on damp hair and blow-dried for all over volume and have also tried the&amp;#34;use fingers to apply to roots&amp;#34;method for more of a spot booster for my shorter, spiky hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  Helps me a lot with adding volume and styling.  My hair feels thicker when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Works well and does not  make my hair stiff and dull. Can use on wet hair before drying and using irons and such.  I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO!!!!!!!! THIS MAKES MY HAIR LOOK AWESOME... I TRUST THIS PRODUCT PLEASE BUY</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Good product</li>
            <li> This product instantly thickens my hair before blow drying. I have fine, soft hair and a lot of it. Soft is fun to touch, but not good for styling. I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect amount of sprays yet. Too many and my hair falls flat and heavy, not enough and my hair is too soft to style. It&#x27;s the closest product I&#x27;ve found to obtaining that balance though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick I&#x27;ve found, that works for me, is to use it after blow drying and only at the roots. Then I do another quick blow to make sure it dries completely. The smell is not my favorite but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and gives fullness.</li>
            <li> First, I thank my sister for introducing me to \\&quot;product,\\&quot; as they say in the South. (I am the \\&quot;other\\&quot; sister.) \\&quot;Product\\&quot; makes me feel as glamorous as I&#x27;m ever going to get. ... I was very unhappy when my hair stylist of about 20 years (whom I still love) no longer carried this product due to low demand and perhaps high price. But the alternative she provided was not nearly as good as this one is. My hair is thin and goes flat easily, though I have a fair bit of it. I need something to fluff it up all day and make it \\&quot;swing.\\&quot; Aquage thickening spraygel does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It disappears -- you have no sense that you used it all -- but your hair is light, full, and silky, and it lasts until you shampoo again. You don&#x27;t need much. It doesn&#x27;t work as well without blow-drying, except somewhat in summer-sun-dried hair. I use it in combination with a little bit of Eufora Beautifying Serum oil (also discontinued by my stylist and now purchased through Amazon) just on the ends to prevent split ends and so I can blow-dry and not have flyaway hair. Highly recommended.  PLEASE don&#x27;t go out of business!</li>
            <li> pretty good stuff for fine hair. still leaves hair soft, yet a little more managable. would be better if it added more shine</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and it keeps doing what I want it to on my hair :D</li>
            <li> I thought that this spray gel would do amazing things for my hair, but it didn&#x27;t deliver.  As a girl with naturally curly hair you would think that I would be easy to please and impress with another hair product that promises the world and neglects to inform us that the world is comprised of women with straight and well behaved hair.  But no.  I am cursed with hair that alternated between having the texture of a sheep&#x27;s wool that is well past time for shearing or hair that is so heavily weighted by its own oily juices that I resemble someone that has been on a three day binge.  I need a spraygel that will completely change the texture of my wayward locks.  I need a hair styling hero.  This was merely another zero.</li>
            <li> This works really well with the KMS California Freeshape spray.  I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two really thicken and texturize my hair with a quick blowdry.  I also like the control they give if I style with a brush.  They don&#x27;t dry my hair out which has been a problem for me with most volumizing/thickening products.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it is easy to work with. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it gummy. I can even wake up the next morning, fluff my hair and ready to go with only minor touchups. Not need to redo it the next day if not enough time.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and this gel is just the right consistency and weight to take away the &amp;#34;alfalfa sprouts&amp;#34; without weighing it down so that it looks flat.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thickening Spraygel for 10+ years.  I have very silky fine hair.  Without Aquage it just lays there.  A few sprays of this and my hair feels thicker.  It holds a style.  It works wonders on my bangs.  Just spray in your wet hair and blow dry.  Amazing stuff!  I never let myself run out.  I order multiple bottles at one time.  If Aquage ever quits making this.......It will be a bad hair day indeed.</li>
            <li> This product provides my hair with volume and strength! I use it every day before blow drying and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, Works well. And I am so happy to get it so quickly thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually thickens my hair! I was a bit weary as it&#x27;s a gel and I thought it would weigh my hair down, but it&#x27;s perfect! I have a very fine blonde hair. I applied it after a shower to wet hair. After blowdrying and straight ironing my hair, it actually feels and looks thicker! Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair</li>
            <li> This product is great for my thin hair. I have used it for 3 years but my salon no longer stocks it.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and I love this product. I put it in my damp hair every time I wash it before blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x60;t like it at all. It made my hair stiff and dry. It did not enhance any of the thickness. I was very disappointed as the reviews were very promising.</li>
            <li> The best product ever!!!  My hair is very fine and it give me a lot of body.  I have told all my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hair, no volume at all, I tried not combing thru my hair and combing it thru my hair, no difference, just like I didn&#x27;t use any product at all.  I have flat, thin hair and that is the way it stayed with this.  I will continue to use my other products.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine limp hair</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this product i have not had problems after washing hair as in the past. It really helps my thin hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, silky, stick straight hair that is impossible to style, much less have volume. This product leaves my hair voluminous all day lone, with no residue, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I need product in my hair to get some body and fullness, otherwise it lies flat.  I use this product after Kerasilk fluid and it gives my hair moderate hold and fullness after I blowdry it or use hot rollers.  It&#x27;s not the hardest holding product I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s adequate and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this from my hair stylist and really liked it. It does add some volume to my hair. I was unable to find it at Target, so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Pricey but worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I love it love it love it!  I finally found a gel that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or gooey!  It improved the texture of my hair and made it easy to style.  It also makes my hair smell really nice.  I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> It made my hair too soft and flyaway...no hold, no style, zip.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a thickening product. I decided to try this one because even though the price was a bit high, the ratings were also very high. I should first start off by saying that i&#x27;m an african-american woman with naturally curly hair that flat irons my hair and wears it straight regularly. On the bottle, it says that you can apply it on wet and/or dry hair. I applied  it to my wet hair, blow dried, and flat ironed it and it definitely did what it promised. My hair was thick and full and I loved the smell of this stuff! Although my hair was full already, I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add more once my hair was finished and dry. Although I was a bit scared of any reversion that might occur when a gel or spray is usually applied on freshly flat ironed curly hair, I took the plunge anyway, and it worked perfectly- no reversion, just thicker hair. I&#x27;m definitely in love with this product, and can&#x27;t wait to try more of the aquage line.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really gives life to my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> I love this spray gel because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. It also gives just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this product on me and I was hooked.  It is like a light gel that sprays on.  It is not heavy and does give my fine hair body with out the alcohol or harshness of other products.  A plus is that it smells great although not a heavy scent that overpowers the rest of you, just clean. I always buy more before I completely run out because I can&#x27;t imagaine being without!</li>
            <li> My husband and I use as it makes thin hair look thicker. No flaking of product if you use to much! Have used for years!</li>
            <li> Excellent product--I love the way it works, not too stiff but definitely adds volume. The scent, like all Aquage products, is great. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I need a product to help punch it up a little. This works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used! No drying out, either. Yeah!</li>
            <li> Aqua Thickening Spraygel works great on my fine hair.  It gives my hair extra body.  Sometimes instead of spraying it directly on my hair, I will spray it in my palm and apply it with my fingertips.</li>
            <li> This spray gel give nice body and volume without stickiness.  Aquage Thickening Spraygel leave a very nice shine without a hint of greasiness.  Great stuff!</li>
