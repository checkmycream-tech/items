            <li>I use these and flossing to keep my gums in good order.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very satisfied with this brand.</li>

            <li>These pics are awesome, the best floss pic for tight contacts.  </li>

            <li>and I was thrilled I could get them at amazon.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best thing my dentist has ever given me!!</li>
            <li>Great to clean your teeth with.  </li>
            <li>This company DID invent a better toothbrush; an item I thought was pretty much as good as it got !</li>
            <li>However, many times I do use these exclusively and feel very comfortable that all of the residue has been removed.</li>
            <li>We love these.</li>
            <li>better to use a toothpick or floss.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Much better than a toothpick.</li>
            <li>I love these picks for cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>fit nicely in-between the teeth and remove plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>Love these, I just wish the container would stay shut so they don&#x27;t spill all over my purse.</li>
            <li>Easier than flossing, and the dentist says my teeth and gums have never been in better shape.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did find them on Amazon (what a surprise!).  </li>
            <li>Love them, dentist gave sample to grandson.</li>
            <li>I love these toothpicks.</li>
            <li>I love these pics.  </li>
            <li>We love these.</li>
            <li>Healthy gums are more important than your teeth because your gums house them!</li>
            <li>I prefer a more sturdy tooth pick.</li>
            <li>They are more sturdy.</li>
            <li>But they more than outweigh the dangers that may or may not lurk there.</li>
            <li>They are convenient, more sanitary than a toothpick, and I can attend to an issue discretely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my dentist introduced me to Opalpix.</li>
            <li>The product is effective, and by buying in bulk, the price is right!</li>
            <li>Will be keeping one of the packs in the car, one in the office and the rest in the kitchen for easy access.</li>
            <li>No fuss, easily taken anywhere.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are close together, but these toothpicks slide between them easily.  </li>
            <li>These picks are strong and don&#x27;t bend when using them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong and won&#x27;t snap when you put pressure on them.  </li>
            <li>I shared some with my mother and she quickly grew to love them, too.</li>
            <li>They fit between every size of tooth and gum.</li>
            <li>I can only speak for one mouth, but these really are the best toothpicks I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They are utterly discreet to carry on your very own &#x27;person&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have never flossed that much (true confessions), but these are a great substitute for flossing that I use several times a day.</li>
            <li>The gripping surface is large and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>, they really clean well and work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Not a replacement for dental floss, I think, but a way to keep the area between teeth clean during the day.</li>
            <li>They actually clean between the teeth and help reduce tarter buildup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and useful.</li>
            <li>to clean plaque build up from our dog&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>These were hard to find - perfect for cleaning in between my teeth after meals.</li>
            <li>They are great for the times when you really do not want to dig out the dental floss.</li>
            <li>Really only able to use the brush side on most of my teeth, but neither side will fit into the space where my teeth are crowded.  </li>
            <li>Later I was delighted when I found them on-line at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love them so much, search for them and found them here</li>
            <li>They are perfect to reach that hard-to-reach piece of something stuck in your mouth and the flexibility allows more comfort that other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>husband has more issues with his teeth (crooked, too close) and he likes these much better than floss.</li>
            <li>Now I can carry them with me for quick use after meals, snacks, etc.</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with this product and plans to use them as long as they are available.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if they replace flossing, but for me these are ideal.  </li>
            <li>These things are awesome, don&#x27;t know why they are hard to find!</li>
            <li>They slide easily between teeth and gently massages the gums.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I was hooked!</li>
            <li>These little dental picks work great.</li>
            <li>And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag.</li>
            <li>These are the next best thing to using dental floss...way better than any ordinary toothpick!</li>
            <li>These picks tend to bend easily and are a bit too small, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re nearly as good as the Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners .</li>
            <li>They do a great job for people who have very tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>Priced right and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>These are really soft and bends easily.</li>
            <li>These were first given to me by a dentist.</li>
            <li>I first got these as samples from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I first found them in a &#x27;goodie&#x27; bag from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many lifetimes 192 will last, so I am passing them out to friends.</li>
            <li>Way better than the standard toothpick.</li>
            <li>I use the floss first followed by these Opalpix.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than dental floss and gets between the teeth better than a traditional tooth pick.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the large economy pack to give some to my dad who&#x27;s gums are receding as he ages.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how fine this product is.</li>
            <li>Nice little toothpick.</li>
            <li>Their smooth surfaces are gentle on the gums, and they reach into tight spaces comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Fast service all as promised</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>They really do the job with hassle.</li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>They are the only dental picks that fit between my permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>I worked for Ultradent, the maker of this product, for a short time and got a free sample of these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast turn around time.</li>
            <li>These work really well for me</li>
            <li>They are thin and do a great job of cleaning food from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it.</li>
            <li>These work well and do a far better cleaning job than either dental floss or similar picks.</li>
            <li>Could not be happier with them, so I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this dental aide.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I liked them, but they were hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li>Originally got a single pack from my dentist and as soon as I ran out I ordered this jumbo pack.</li>
            <li>first I&#x27;ve ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I&#x27;ve worried sick about how to maintain that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they fit in between my teeth and have a little roughness on them.</li>
            <li>I clean them and reuse them, they can last as long as they do not get lost.</li>
            <li>They are soft plastic.</li>
            <li>I would never have believed a product as simple as a tooth cleaning device could have been improved upon so much.</li>
            <li>I found them too thin and pliable to be effective.</li>
            <li>It may read like I am selling them, but no, it&#x27;s just a very positive reaction about a product so simple and yet so universal; that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>The seller needs to come up with a better picture to show the actual pick...perhaps a black or colored background instead of white on white.</li>
            <li>Also the bottom edges are pretty sharp ,not for one with tender gums.</li>
            <li>Soft enough so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually.</li>
            <li>Now I floss less, and use these dental picks more ... and since they&#x27;re reusable (after rinsing, just like a toothbrush), a few should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>He has been  grudgingly looking for a waterpik, but of course none of them do what he wants, with the attachments he wants at the price he wants, which is of course gratis.  </li>

            <li> And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag.</li>
            <li> These are the next best thing to using dental floss...way better than any ordinary toothpick!</li>
            <li> These picks tend to bend easily and are a bit too small, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re nearly as good as the Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners .</li>
            <li> They do a great job for people who have very tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> Priced right and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> These are really soft and bends easily.</li>
            <li> These were first given to me by a dentist.</li>
            <li> I first got these as samples from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I first found them in a &#x27;goodie&#x27; bag from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many lifetimes 192 will last, so I am passing them out to friends.</li>
            <li> Way better than the standard toothpick.</li>
            <li> I use the floss first followed by these Opalpix.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than dental floss and gets between the teeth better than a traditional tooth pick.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the large economy pack to give some to my dad who&#x27;s gums are receding as he ages.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how fine this product is.</li>
            <li> Nice little toothpick.</li>
            <li> Their smooth surfaces are gentle on the gums, and they reach into tight spaces comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Fast service all as promised</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> They really do the job with hassle.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> They are the only dental picks that fit between my permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> I worked for Ultradent, the maker of this product, for a short time and got a free sample of these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast turn around time.</li>
            <li> These work really well for me</li>
            <li> They are thin and do a great job of cleaning food from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it.</li>
            <li> These work well and do a far better cleaning job than either dental floss or similar picks.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with them, so I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this dental aide.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked them, but they were hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> Originally got a single pack from my dentist and as soon as I ran out I ordered this jumbo pack.</li>
            <li> first I&#x27;ve ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I&#x27;ve worried sick about how to maintain that.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, they fit in between my teeth and have a little roughness on them.</li>
            <li> I clean them and reuse them, they can last as long as they do not get lost.</li>
            <li> They are soft plastic.</li>
            <li> I would never have believed a product as simple as a tooth cleaning device could have been improved upon so much.</li>
            <li> I found them too thin and pliable to be effective.</li>
            <li> It may read like I am selling them, but no, it&#x27;s just a very positive reaction about a product so simple and yet so universal; that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> The seller needs to come up with a better picture to show the actual pick...perhaps a black or colored background instead of white on white.</li>
            <li> Also the bottom edges are pretty sharp ,not for one with tender gums.</li>
            <li> Soft enough so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually.</li>
            <li> Now I floss less, and use these dental picks more ... and since they&#x27;re reusable (after rinsing, just like a toothbrush), a few should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> He has been  grudgingly looking for a waterpik, but of course none of them do what he wants, with the attachments he wants at the price he wants, which is of course gratis.  </li>
            <li> These are very thin so they get between the teeth better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Long lasting as well</li>
            <li> However, the seal at one end was partially opened and one of the Opalpix containers was open.</li>
            <li> If careful you might use one for several days.</li>
            <li> Toothpicks don&#x27;t even get between all your teeth and have sharp ends and get stuck in various pockets or pouches, if you carried any!</li>
            <li> I will never ever go back to any other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bendy enough that you can get to spots that other picks can&#x27;t reach, yet stiff enough to actually work.</li>
            <li> These are also quite short, might have a hard time getting to the back teeth</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> The slightly rough surface grips anything stuck and gets out anything in your gums while also polishing the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Using these things is like trying shove a wet noodle through a needle eye.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prepared to be careful and use them careful to avoid that.</li>
            <li> The container stays closed in my purse.</li>
            <li> I can use them like a toothpick only they have an abraded edge and a very sharp point that goes in those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> , Waterpiks are expensive and cumbersome, time consuming, and take up so much space in a small bathroom, and floss just doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> Opalpix are not cheap, but then neither is a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about them is they are so thin it makes them potential sharp edge could cut a gum.</li>
            <li> The six pack arrived in a small padded mailing envelope.</li>
            <li> You can carry them with you because box is small.</li>
            <li> No more toothpicks for me.</li>
            <li> Dental floss is difficult and dentists split dental floss and even those plastic strips they use to help form materials on a tooth from getting on the teeth next to them...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for flat toothpicks ever since a trip to Scandinavia, but these plastic ones cut my gums unfortunately</li>
            <li> Thin enough to &#x27;floss&#x27; with, less awkward than floss.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and these are slippery and hard to grab, hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> this tries to be &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; and fails</li>
            <li> I think I have one up on him here as he is a depression baby, which in common vernacular means \\&quot; cheapskate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and that does mean braces....</li>
            <li> Very thin and can get into the tight spaces.</li>
            <li> Even has textured surface t got at tough food particles.</li>
            <li> Total crap.  </li>
            <li> Thin and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but they are no where as thin as these.</li>
            <li> They are portable, thin, flexible and sanitary (plastic).</li>
            <li> We were unable to locate any in our northern NH area</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these picks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love these. Thin enough to &#x27;floss&#x27; with, less awkward than floss. Soft enough so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> These were first given to me by a dentist. I LOVED them. So I got a bunch for me. I shared some with my mother and she quickly grew to love them, too. So I had to order a bunch for her, too. We wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> Fast service all as promised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Brushpick&#x27;s by Doctors for about a year.  Really only able to use the brush side on most of my teeth, but neither side will fit into the space where my teeth are crowded.  I don&#x27;t know where my daughter got these, however, I found one and decided to try it.  It worked great at getting into all the nooks and crannies that the Brushpicks don&#x27;t.  Definitely ordering these to supplement by dental care.</li>
            <li> These work great.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> A good alternative for overpriced rota points</li>
            <li> My 90 yo mom cannot floss because of arthritis in her hands. These picks are strong and don&#x27;t bend when using them. She&#x27;s very satisfied with this brand.</li>
            <li> Total crap.  flimsy, don&#x27;t hold up at all.  better to use a toothpick or floss.  this tries to be &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; and fails</li>
            <li> A friend shared these with me at dinner one night and I&#x27;ll never use another toothpick!  It&#x27;s an excellent value by purchasing in a 6-pack, so I can keep a pack in my purse, one by the bed, one in the car, etc.  These picks slide effortlessly through the gaps in teeth and don&#x27;t break like wooden toothpicks or bend like the flimsier plastic ones with the brushes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! For those of us who are at that age where everything stick to and between your teeth. Thin and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Much better than a toothpick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t floss with out them.  They really do the job with hassle.</li>
            <li> Nice little toothpick. Great gifts!  Good price!</li>
            <li> Bought these for spouse on recommendation of dentist.  He loves them.  We were unable to locate any in our northern NH area so went to our stand-by - Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love these picks for cleaning teeth.  They do a great job for people who have very tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for flat toothpicks ever since a trip to Scandinavia, but these plastic ones cut my gums unfortunately</li>
            <li> Best toothpicks ever!</li>
            <li> My dentist introduced me to these wonder picks. They make a difference in the amount of plaque that accumulates. Great product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample box of these from my dentist last year and have been searching for them ever since. I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store and so bought another brand, thinking they would be the same. They were not! Finally decided to check on Amazon and to my delight, found them! These should last awhile!&lt;br /&gt;They fit nicely in-between the teeth and remove plaque buildup. I can&#x27;t stand flossing because it cuts into my fingers and I can&#x27;t reach in the back of my mouth with it. But I don&#x27;t seem to have an issue with these.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has more issues with his teeth (crooked, too close) and he likes these much better than floss.</li>
            <li> I have been using tis product for several years and keep coming back! They are perfect to reach that hard-to-reach piece of something stuck in your mouth and the flexibility allows more comfort that other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> bendy enough that you can get to spots that other picks can&#x27;t reach, yet stiff enough to actually work.</li>
            <li> Love these, I just wish the container would stay shut so they don&#x27;t spill all over my purse. That&#x27;s the only draw back. Otherwise, they fit in between my teeth and have a little roughness on them. Way better than toothpicks!</li>
            <li> Really like the product. Arrived as expected and on time. Friend recommended it to me and I would recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> These were given to me by dentist years ago! He said they were discontinued, so I was happy to find them online and buy a pack. They are the only dental picks that fit between my permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> The six pack arrived in a small padded mailing envelope. The six pack was wrapped in what should have been a sealed plastic wrap. However, the seal at one end was partially opened and one of the Opalpix containers was open. I did not bother to count the number of picks but I threw out that container. Doubtful that this could have occurred during shipment.</li>
            <li> I worked for Ultradent, the maker of this product, for a short time and got a free sample of these. After the first use I was hooked! These are the next best thing to using dental floss...way better than any ordinary toothpick! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Beat picks on the market.  Long lasting as well</li>
            <li> These were hard to find - perfect for cleaning in between my teeth after meals. Easier than flossing, and the dentist says my teeth and gums have never been in better shape.</li>
            <li> These pics are awesome, the best floss pic for tight contacts.  I will purchase this product again.  Thanks for the fast turn around time.</li>
            <li> You can carry them with you because box is small. Great for traveling or at work. They are soft plastic. My dentist gives them out, too.</li>
            <li> The product is effective, and by buying in bulk, the price is right! Factor in Amazon Prime shipping, and this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The perfect toothpick&lt;br /&gt;These picks have a triangular shape, getting larger both in height and width as they go in.  The slightly rough surface grips anything stuck and gets out anything in your gums while also polishing the teeth.  The gripping surface is large and easy to hold.  I clean them and reuse them, they can last as long as they do not get lost.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a box of opalpix after my last cleaning. These are the best I have ever used. They are great for the times when you really do not want to dig out the dental floss.</li>
            <li> Great picks, easy to use, they really clean well and work as advertised. Could not be happier with them, so I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Never floss again, great product.  Originally got a single pack from my dentist and as soon as I ran out I ordered this jumbo pack.</li>
            <li> Using these things is like trying shove a wet noodle through a needle eye. Also the bottom edges are pretty sharp ,not for one with tender gums. I have arthritis in my hands and these are slippery and hard to grab, hard to maneuver. These are also quite short, might have a hard time getting to the back teeth</li>
            <li> I love these things. No more toothpicks for me.</li>
            <li> These are very thin so they get between the teeth better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I first got these as samples from my dentist.  I liked them, but they were hard to find in the store.  Fortunately I did find them on Amazon (what a surprise!).  These work really well for me, I prefer them over toothpicks and floos (although you still may wish to use that once and a while).</li>
            <li> Very thin and can get into the tight spaces. Even has textured surface t got at tough food particles.</li>
            <li> I first found them in a &#x27;goodie&#x27; bag from my dentist.  Later I was delighted when I found them on-line at Amazon. Now I can carry them with me for quick use after meals, snacks, etc. They work great for me !!!!</li>
            <li> My dad found a box of these in my grandmothers house when she passed and it had been 10 years since he could find them again. It wasn&#x27;t until Amazon came to the rescue and force fed him enough picks to last him another decade that he was truly content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are unreal. I&#x27;ll never need to try another type again.</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep in the office and in the car.  Not a replacement for dental floss, I think, but a way to keep the area between teeth clean during the day.</li>
            <li> I can only speak for one mouth, but these really are the best toothpicks I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t know how many lifetimes 192 will last, so I am passing them out to friends.</li>
            <li> Love them, dentist gave sample to grandson. Love them so much, search for them and found them here</li>
            <li> Great product and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> These little dental picks work great. They are easy to use and leave the teeth happy. They are sturdy enough to rinse off and reuse several times. I will reorder them when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love these toothpicks. They are thin and do a great job of cleaning food from between your teeth. I have never flossed that much (true confessions), but these are a great substitute for flossing that I use several times a day.</li>
            <li> Priced right and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to leave in my car.  These are great for between meals, on the go, without the convenience of a toothbrush.  Way better than the standard toothpick.</li>
            <li> This item is so superior to using wood toothpicks.  They do not break off between your teeth.  They actually clean between the teeth and help reduce tarter buildup.  highly recommend this dental aide.</li>
            <li> I found them too thin and pliable to be effective.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome, don&#x27;t know why they are hard to find! They are the best thing out there! They work great!</li>
            <li> I love these! I tried a different brand and nothing compares to Opalpix.  I won&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> These things are the best. Flossy is not going to happen with me, so I use these...love em.  It&#x27;s easy and useful.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a pack of these and I was blown away by how well they worked. They slide easily between teeth and gently massages the gums.  I bought 6 packs! I give them away to friends and family they are that good.</li>
            <li> My husband use these over what we found in the store.  He is very satisfied with this product and plans to use them as long as they are available.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> These work well and do a far better cleaning job than either dental floss or similar picks.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with these picks.  Much easier to use than dental floss and gets between the teeth better than a traditional tooth pick.  Also found these to be handy for use to clean plaque build up from our dog&#x27;s teeth.  Will be keeping one of the packs in the car, one in the office and the rest in the kitchen for easy access.</li>
            <li> These picks tend to bend easily and are a bit too small, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re nearly as good as the Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners .</li>
            <li> Utterly Amazing Product!!!! There is food between your teeth! You don&#x27;t like that! How do you get rid of it when you haven&#x27;t even brought toothpicks with you! Toothpicks don&#x27;t even get between all your teeth and have sharp ends and get stuck in various pockets or pouches, if you carried any! ENTER Opalpix!!! They fit between every size of tooth and gum. They are utterly discreet to carry on your very own &#x27;person&#x27;. They are discreet to use in public since they are short. It may read like I am selling them, but no, it&#x27;s just a very positive reaction about a product so simple and yet so universal; that&#x27;s all. Buy some and you&#x27;ll see.....</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. This product worked perfect and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these pics.  My dentest gave me some and I was thrilled I could get them at amazon.  It also is a great flosser.</li>
            <li> We love these. Their compact and easy to carry with you and work great!</li>
            <li> Not sure if they replace flossing, but for me these are ideal.  No fuss, easily taken anywhere.  I can use them like a toothpick only they have an abraded edge and a very sharp point that goes in those hard to reach places.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 years.  My dentist says my teeth look great.  I use them after every meal.</li>
            <li> Opalpix are not cheap, but then neither is a dentist.  I use these and flossing to keep my gums in good order.  Healthy gums are more important than your teeth because your gums house them!</li>
            <li> Now I floss less, and use these dental picks more ... and since they&#x27;re reusable (after rinsing, just like a toothbrush), a few should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of Oralpix 32ct, 6 packs 192 total picks.  Their smooth surfaces are gentle on the gums, and they reach into tight spaces comfortably.  Additionally, for me, these picks get into areas that dental floss at times does not quite reach. I use the floss first followed by these Opalpix. However, many times I do use these exclusively and feel very comfortable that all of the residue has been removed. I highly recommend this product. Thank you for another excellent product, Amazon, that I have not found anywhere else!</li>
            <li> These are really soft and bends easily. I prefer a more sturdy tooth pick. I meant to get the Rotaflex. They are more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth. Dental floss is difficult and dentists split dental floss and even those plastic strips they use to help form materials on a tooth from getting on the teeth next to them...those will be demolished over and over before eventually they give up and turn to something else or manage to finally get a strip in between my teeth. Anyway at over 60 I&#x27;m  having some orthodontal work done and that does mean braces....first I&#x27;ve ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I&#x27;ve worried sick about how to maintain that. Along comes these picks and on reviews alone and sight unseen I took a chance. They came today and they are perfect for my needs they are getting between some teeth that no floss could get between. The only bad thing about them is they are so thin it makes them potential sharp edge could cut a gum. I&#x27;m prepared to be careful and use them careful to avoid that. But they more than outweigh the dangers that may or may not lurk there. Also they seem to hold up. I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually. And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag. If careful you might use one for several days. And you could probably sanitize them if you choose with mouth wash. Six packs means about six months supply. I&#x27;m happy with these..not so happy with the ordeal of braces. But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it. I&#x27;ve tried some plastic like dental picks similar to tooth picks and tiny brush on one end but they are no where as thin as these. The seller needs to come up with a better picture to show the actual pick...perhaps a black or colored background instead of white on white.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! Absolutely the best thing my dentist has ever given me!!</li>
            <li> Great to clean your teeth with.  these are tooth picks on steroids.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these picks.  They work so well.  I have purchased them for my sons, and they like them as well.  They are great stocking stuffers for grown kids.</li>
            <li> My teeth are close together, but these toothpicks slide between them easily.  They&#x27;re strong and won&#x27;t snap when you put pressure on them.  I often use them instead of floss.</li>
            <li> I have never been so enamored with a product in my life; and it turns out to be a toothpick?!  I would never have believed a product as simple as a tooth cleaning device could have been improved upon so much. This company DID invent a better toothbrush; an item I thought was pretty much as good as it got ! I cannot stress enough how fine this product is. Truly amazing!&lt;br /&gt; Toothpicks are no longer made of hardwood making them break and splinter, Waterpiks are expensive and cumbersome, time consuming, and take up so much space in a small bathroom, and floss just doesn&#x27;t compare.  These picks find debris that none of the above can find. They are portable, thin, flexible and sanitary (plastic). I will never ever go back to any other product.&lt;br /&gt; I ordered the large economy pack to give some to my dad who&#x27;s gums are receding as he ages. He has been  grudgingly looking for a waterpik, but of course none of them do what he wants, with the attachments he wants at the price he wants, which is of course gratis.  I hope this solution surprises and delights him, as he is a stubborn ole curmudgeon.

            <li> Love them !! Thank you</li>
            <li> I love these things! They are convenient, more sanitary than a toothpick, and I can attend to an issue discretely.  The container stays closed in my purse. I&#x27;m so glad my dentist introduced me to Opalpix.</li>
