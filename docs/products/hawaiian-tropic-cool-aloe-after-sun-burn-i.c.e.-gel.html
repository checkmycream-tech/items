            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better then this!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I took this on a camping trip ,just in case, and was able to use it with one of my teenaged grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>Even better when you apply it</li>
            <li>Reapply often on more burned areas and use after every shower until healed.</li>
            <li>After getting sun burnt I applied this product and the cooling sensation made my burn all thatmuch more bareable.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunburn remedy.  </li>
            <li>Hence the 4 stars - this review is really more of a fair warning ; )</li>
            <li>I am quickly becoming a fan of Hawaiian Tropic products</li>
            <li>If you can manage to keep it out of your mouth you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>This has real aloe and moisturizers, and it&#x27;s a large bottle - a win in my book.  </li>
            <li>Hawaiian Tropic is my favorite of all brands due to their use of plant and fruit extracts that not only are healthy for your skin but smell great!</li>
            <li>I use this specifically on any part of my skin that got sunburned to help cool and heal the burn.</li>
            <li>after i apply some on my skin , it feels cool.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cool, quick relief.</li>
            <li>good product worked as expected</li>
            <li>Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed but some today plus it smells great</li>
            <li>You can get it much cheaper here at amazon!</li>
            <li>I normally get this kind of stuff at a local store but couldn&#x27;t find any.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid fifty&#x27;s, fair to medium skin, and recently went on a cruise to the Bahamas.</li>
            <li>Even better if you put it in the refrigerator and cool it down.</li>
            <li>It smells good, it&#x27;s not too sticky or messy, and it does the job!</li>
            <li>It helped a lot, and while it doesn&#x27;t really heal damage, the soothing, symptom release is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>After a sun burn, this product has a very cooling effect.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work, and you do get a lot of it, but they added too much perfume to it.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original aloe after sun</li>
            <li>This is more like a gel and a little sticky at first until absorbed so only used on specifically burned areas.</li>
            <li>and my skin gets a little more sun than it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I used Aloe gel right after a really bad burn, and it worked for maybe 20-30 minutes at a time, but this just seemed a lot more soothing.</li>

            <li> The bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and after a day in the sun I need a product that can stop the itching, needless to say this product is very soothing.</li>
            <li> My skin become itchy and have small red bumps every time after sunburn.</li>
            <li> They have never let me down - this product included.</li>
            <li> It helps cooling down and comfort the skin.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and not overwhelmingly fragrant</li>
            <li> A day later will prove to be a painful one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; with it during the beach holiday, and afterwards, it will forever sit in the back of the toiletries cabinet until I can offload it to someone I hate on their beach holidays.</li>
            <li> Sticky and the residue after drying is uncomfortable, yucky and makes you want to take a shower all over again to wash it</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t result in a bad burn.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling it is also quite bad for you as it gave me a stomach ache just from getting it on my lips.  </li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful!  </li>

            <li> Greats melling product, does teh joba nd teh bottle is larger than I had anticipated</li>
            <li> Sticky and the residue after drying is uncomfortable, yucky and makes you want to take a shower all over again to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; with it during the beach holiday, and afterwards, it will forever sit in the back of the toiletries cabinet until I can offload it to someone I hate on their beach holidays.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any better then this! Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed but some today plus it smells great</li>
            <li> This product helped me a lot when I got sunburned. Hawaiian Tropic is my favorite of all brands due to their use of plant and fruit extracts that not only are healthy for your skin but smell great! I have sensitive skin and after a day in the sun I need a product that can stop the itching, needless to say this product is very soothing. Hawaiian Tropic products are typically more expensive and at a convenient store I visited this same product sold for $12.99. You can get it much cheaper here at amazon!</li>
            <li> I try to stick to using only Hawaiian Tropic products when it comes to my skin and being out in the sun. They have never let me down - this product included. I try to avoid getting burnt by the sun, but occasionally I&#x27;ll stay out too long and my skin gets a little more sun than it&#x27;s supposed to. This after sun cooling gel provides an instant relief. It smells good, it&#x27;s not too sticky or messy, and it does the job!</li>
            <li> I took this on a camping trip ,just in case, and was able to use it with one of my teenaged grandchildren.  It is soothing and not overwhelmingly fragrant</li>
            <li> It relieves the pain of sunburn instantly. Even better if you put it in the refrigerator and cool it down. Even better when you apply it and it&#x27;s cool, quick relief.</li>
            <li> My skin become itchy and have small red bumps every time after sunburn. It helps cooling down and comfort the skin. Stop the itchy for a while. And smells good.</li>
            <li> I used Aloe gel right after a really bad burn, and it worked for maybe 20-30 minutes at a time, but this just seemed a lot more soothing. It helped a lot, and while it doesn&#x27;t really heal damage, the soothing, symptom release is greatly appreciated. I also started using it just to return moisture to time outside that didn&#x27;t result in a bad burn. I am quickly becoming a fan of Hawaiian Tropic products</li>
            <li> good product worked as expected</li>
            <li> Great Aloe Vera. Rubbed it everywhere</li>
            <li> After a sun burn, this product has a very cooling effect. The aloe seems to help. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great for use on sunburned skin. I am in my mid fifty&#x27;s, fair to medium skin, and recently went on a cruise to the Bahamas. I use this specifically on any part of my skin that got sunburned to help cool and heal the burn. This is more like a gel and a little sticky at first until absorbed so only used on specifically burned areas. Reapply often on more burned areas and use after every shower until healed. I would follow up with the Hawaiian Tropic lime coolada moisturizing lotion over this area and the rest of my skin. Together it promoted the healing and tanning of my skin and help maintain it for a longer period of time. I&#x27;ve been using Hawaiian tropic products since I was a teenager and I would recommend them anytime.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my mom and she loves it, she is a beach lady, good quality and  for the price is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original aloe after sun</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! Why didn&#x27;t I find this stuff years ago??</li>
            <li> After getting sun burnt I applied this product and the cooling sensation made my burn all thatmuch more bareable. Being made by Hawaiian, it smells great and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunburn remedy.  It has lidocaine for a cooling effect, which helps to soothe the skin!!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all been there.  You get home to realize you didn&#x27;t reapply your sunscreen in time, or didn&#x27;t apply a sufficient amount, and you are now a seeing red!  A day later will prove to be a painful one.  Zack, the resident jack-wagon at the office runs up to you, slapping you on the back, asking how your trip to the beach was, and refers to you as \\&quot;lobster boy\\&quot;.  Stop the pain, with Hawaiian Tropic After Sun!</li>
            <li> after i apply some on my skin , it feels cool. but I think it clogs my pore because i will feel stuffy after a while. just use once.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have a sunburn! I will buy again but it will be awhile! The bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I normally get this kind of stuff at a local store but couldn&#x27;t find any. The product seems to work, and you do get a lot of it, but they added too much perfume to it. The scent is like shaving cream or after shave in smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful!  I have a feeling it is also quite bad for you as it gave me a stomach ache just from getting it on my lips.  I will probably go with a cream based lotion next time but for now I have to use what I have.  If you can manage to keep it out of your mouth you should be fine.  Hence the 4 stars - this review is really more of a fair warning ; )</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I take this to our cabin for the people who don&#x27;t bring sunscreen.  Works wonders</li>
            <li> Definitely great quantity for the price!</li>
            <li> This has real aloe and moisturizers, and it&#x27;s a large bottle - a win in my book.  Definitely a gel consistency (vs. a lotion) though.</li>
