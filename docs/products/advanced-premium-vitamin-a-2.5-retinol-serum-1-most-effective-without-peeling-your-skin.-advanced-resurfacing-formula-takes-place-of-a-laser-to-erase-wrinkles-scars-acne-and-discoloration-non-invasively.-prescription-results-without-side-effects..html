            <li>Eye Magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the time to research.</li>
            <li>My complexion looks so much better.</li>
            <li>It also brightens my complexion and my skin tone seems to be more even.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for any better , I will be a customer for life..</li>
            <li>I also love the Vitamin C. Waiting to try the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>Thank you, I will be sure not to ever run out of this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is already glowing with more uniform color.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to smooth on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have honestly seen a tremendous change in my skin, which I don&#x27;t think is just wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the clean feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin obsorbed it immediately and it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave any sticky residue and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Easily applied and noticed results in 10 days.</li>
            <li>Premium Retinol 2.5% Serum is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>When I first read the reviews on this product, there were so many five star comments I almost didn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed with the results so far - in a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I also tried a bit of it on my hands as, with many women of a certain age, my hands have started to get that wrinkly old-lady look.</li>
            <li>Then, I apply coconut oil or moisturizer, to get the full hydrating benefit of the Serums.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>VERY important if you have sensitive skin or sensitivities to those items.</li>
            <li>Surprising to see such effect so quickly after starting use, definitely more noticeable than the retinol products I&#x27;ve tried from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The Advanced Premium Retinol A Serum has a convenient dropper and it controls how much of the 2.5% retinol serum you use at one time.</li>
            <li>And it really made my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I truly am impressed and Love Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol-A serum + their other products.</li>
            <li>It is not drying, not oily but just RIGHT.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and visually is the best it has looked in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>So far they seem light weight and go right into the skin</li>
            <li>I would recoommend this to anyone interested in natural and easy to use skin care.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, plumps up fine lines, and leaves my skin glow-y!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, and smooth after using this product</li>
            <li>Skin noticeably hydrated after applying, almost as if the cells are plumped up from inside instead of the more topical effect of serums I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I have the first two products</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick almost &#x27;pudding&#x27; like texture, but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>This company is willing to work with you as far as customizing your routine the right way.</li>
            <li>so I cut back, was so easy and fast to get help from RB.</li>
            <li>and my skin is really soft, I can use it with any other products and it goes on very smooth and dries quickly, I would highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>however I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li>I really am amazed at how this product made my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Smooth skin blemishes still present after 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I asked my son if he could tell any difference, and he said absolutely, my skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>This retinol works very well.</li>
            <li>I like it; compares very favorably with the $$$ stuff Mrs. EgusHdus bought off the shopping channels.</li>
            <li>It is almost fragrance free, has a very faint pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>Ok... just for the record, I&#x27;m just an average 57 year old woman.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend raw biology retinol to anyone looking for fast results with clear, soft skin and expect even better results using all three products toegther.</li>
            <li>Really the only reason I tried it was because the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no burning, redness or itching, even when using around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had kind of a tough time sticking with a skin regime, because I&#x27;ve never seen much benefit from the ones I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li>so i even purchased the retinol cellulite treatment from Raw Biology and it has completely tightened my love handles and is smoothing out the dimples.</li>
            <li>After surgery I developed embarrassing darks spots on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am extremely pleased with the Raw Beauty product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no parabens, sulfates, gluten or animal bi-products in the Raw Beauty Advanced Retinol A serum.</li>
            <li>As I have grown older I started noticing age spots not only on my hand but also on my face, since I have started using your retinol 2.5%</li>
            <li>My wrinkles were less visible from the very first day.</li>
            <li>My skin texture is smooth, and my pores are smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>you are using this with a nighttime moisturizer, apply to your clean face (I recommend applying to your face while it&#x27;s still wet, applying the moisturizer and letting your face dry.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products in past but this one has given me better results.</li>
            <li>and I have used other Retinol products without the same success</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed considerable difference with the decreasing lines and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you may find you need a second application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be rotating this with other facial serums (I also use vitamin C and hyaluronic serums) to help fade scarring over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a very long</li>
            <li> I do want to mention, that after I wash my face, I use either Witch Hazel or Helicrysum &amp; Carrot Seed Hydrosol on my skin, and I let that dry before applying the serums.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased from Raw Biology and second review.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of sun spots that are fading after a month and a half of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I added the vitamin c serum twice a day, &amp; when I reordered and I have seen an even bigger difference in the spots and in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Retinol products for a long time and no other product beats this, seriously.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to get other serums from this line as well for my skin care</li>
            <li> And a little of this goes</li>
            <li> and I have seen a major improvement in my skin and a reduction in random break-outs.  </li>
            <li> I ordered raw biologys&#x27; retinol about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I like Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol-A Serum.</li>
            <li> , I apply a couple drops each of Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol serum &amp; Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Raw Beauty 2.5% retinol serum is made in the USA, is approved by the FDA and has undergone cruelty-free testing in a state of the art laboratory according to the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look forward to using during the cold dry winter months ahead when skin in our northern climate takes a beating, think this will pep it up.</li>
            <li> When I hit my late 30&#x27;s, (I just turned 40!)</li>
            <li> and I experience random allergies.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, anymore.</li>
            <li> I hate to be without it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent results.  My skin feels soft, and smooth after using this product</li>
            <li> Very nice retinol serum, goes on smooth with a silky feel. Skin noticeably hydrated after applying, almost as if the cells are plumped up from inside instead of the more topical effect of serums I&#x27;ve used before. My face feels softer in the morning and I look like I had a good nights sleep even if I didn&#x27;t. Surprising to see such effect so quickly after starting use, definitely more noticeable than the retinol products I&#x27;ve tried from the dermatologist. Look forward to using during the cold dry winter months ahead when skin in our northern climate takes a beating, think this will pep it up. Excellent value for the price, will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Retinol serum and Hyaluronic Acid along with the Vitamin C  I&#x27;ve noticed considerable difference with the decreasing lines and dark spots on my face. I&#x27;ve tried many products and these product tops them all. After surgery I developed embarrassing darks spots on my face and I see them starting to fade! I&#x27;m so ecstatic with this product I&#x27;ve been recommending them to friends. Thanks!! Michele</li>
            <li> I ordered raw biologys&#x27; retinol about a month ago.  I am extremely impressed with the results so far - in a very short period of time.  My skin feels much softer and visually is the best it has looked in a very long time.  I actually purchased the retinol as part of a 3-pack that included Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin-C Serum.  After pregnancy 2 years ago my skin has changed.  I have been more prone to rash&#x27;s and I experience random allergies.  Using all three products has been amazing and I have seen a major improvement in my skin and a reduction in random break-outs.  Highly recommend raw biology retinol to anyone looking for fast results with clear, soft skin and expect even better results using all three products toegther.</li>
            <li> I have some hyperpigmentation on my face and have been looking for ways to help lighten those.  Since I haven&#x27;t used a high concentration of retinol before, I was a little worried about putting it on my face.  I tested this on a scar on my hand for about three weeks and noticed a visible difference.  Now I&#x27;m sold!  I&#x27;ll be rotating this with other facial serums (I also use vitamin C and hyaluronic serums) to help fade scarring over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m a mid-thirties African-American, in case you&#x27;re of a similar skin type.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it was delivered on time however I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin...maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.  The verdict is still out but I don&#x27;t have any negatives on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks and my skin is really soft, I can use it with any other products and it goes on very smooth and dries quickly, I would highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> When I hit my late 30&#x27;s, (I just turned 40!) my skin began to change. Moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, anymore. So, I did some research and found that HA serum, Retinol serum, and Vitamin C were imperative!&lt;br /&gt;  I like Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol-A Serum. It&#x27;s extremely potent, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It has a nice thick almost &#x27;pudding&#x27; like texture, but absorbs very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and isn&#x27;t scented.&lt;br /&gt;  I use it every night after cleansing + toning. (a couple drops cover your entire face &amp; neck) After, I allow it to soak in for a good 10min., I apply a couple drops each of Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol serum &amp; Vitamin C serum. Then, I apply coconut oil or moisturizer, to get the full hydrating benefit of the Serums. It leaves my skin soft, plumps up fine lines, and leaves my skin glow-y!&lt;br /&gt;  I truly am impressed and Love Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinol-A serum + their other products. I will be purchasing more as I run out!!!&lt;br /&gt; *i received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I never guarantee 5 stars</li>
            <li> l love your products my skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change after use.</li>
            <li> The seller provided this product to me at a discount during a promotion in exchange for my unbiased 100% honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use. The Advanced Premium Retinol A Serum has a convenient dropper and it controls how much of the 2.5% retinol serum you use at one time. And a little of this goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this with a nighttime moisturizer, apply to your clean face (I recommend applying to your face while it&#x27;s still wet, applying the moisturizer and letting your face dry. If you have dry skin you may find you need a second application. If so, use a couple more drops. Make sure to get the retinol A serum around your eyes and onto our forehead and neck too. Get it around your jawline as well. It is very easy to smooth on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using with a daytime moisturizer just use a bit of it on your forehead and all over your cheeks. Save using more of it for nighttime when your skin is resting and can absorb more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no parabens, sulfates, gluten or animal bi-products in the Raw Beauty Advanced Retinol A serum. VERY important if you have sensitive skin or sensitivities to those items. I have very sensitive skin and had no burning, redness or itching, even when using around my eyes. I used it around my entire eye, under, the lid, in the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Raw Beauty 2.5% retinol serum is made in the USA, is approved by the FDA and has undergone cruelty-free testing in a state of the art laboratory according to the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the Raw Beauty product and will continue to use it daily. I also tried a bit of it on my hands as, with many women of a certain age, my hands have started to get that wrinkly old-lady look. It has also plumped up the skin on the back of my hands also. I just rub into my hands after applying onto my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use this every night &amp; try to remember every morning, I love it. It goes on great, I use moisturizer over it &amp; I&#x27;ve notived my skin def looks &amp; feels better. I will continue to use this &amp; hope my skin gets even better</li>
            <li> Eye Magic in a bottle. I like this product and will reorder. It is an excellent buy and I have used other Retinol products without the same success so I am taking time to encourage you to bring your product to Saks and Macys.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the clean feel of this product.  My skin obsorbed it immediately and it was easy to apply.  I would recoommend this to anyone interested in natural and easy to use skin care.</li>
            <li> I really am amazed at how this product made my skin look and feel.  I have done photofacials before, but this is something I can use at home every day with the same results.  And it really made my skin feel smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of sun spots that are fading after a month and a half of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I added the vitamin c serum twice a day, &amp; when I reordered and I have seen an even bigger difference in the spots and in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, will keep trying, and will update if I see a difference</li>
            <li> Smooth skin blemishes still present after 2 weeks but I feel progress will occur on my next bottle</li>
            <li> Great for skin - there is a positive difference</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about what the best treatment for acne is and all fingers pointed at retinol. I found this brand and it has been extremely effective. While doing research I found that the best treatment for cellulite was also retinol so i even purchased the retinol cellulite treatment from Raw Biology and it has completely tightened my love handles and is smoothing out the dimples. I&#x27;m glad I took the time to research.</li>
            <li> Ok... just for the record, I&#x27;m just an average 57 year old woman. I have no affiliation to this company whatsoever. When I first read the reviews on this product, there were so many five star comments I almost didn&#x27;t believe it. Really the only reason I tried it was because the price was so reasonable I thought, what the heck. I have been using this in combination with the Vitamin C serum and I have honestly seen a tremendous change in my skin, which I don&#x27;t think is just wishful thinking. My complexion looks so much better. My skin texture is smooth, and my pores are smaller and less noticeable. It also brightens my complexion and my skin tone seems to be more even. I asked my son if he could tell any difference, and he said absolutely, my skin looks much healthier. I&#x27;ve always had kind of a tough time sticking with a skin regime, because I&#x27;ve never seen much benefit from the ones I&#x27;ve tried thus far. I have no problem sticking with these products and look forward to using them every day, because I can see the difference. I do want to mention, that after I wash my face, I use either Witch Hazel or Helicrysum &amp; Carrot Seed Hydrosol on my skin, and I let that dry before applying the serums. After applying the serums I use my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Its a great serum. I have used more expensive products in past but this one has given me better results. It made my skin softer, and brighter. It does not leave any sticky residue and spreads easily. My skin has been looking fresher since I have been using this product. I am planning to get other serums from this line as well for my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is great for helping skin collagen building, and for sun spots as well. It is almost fragrance free, has a very faint pleasant smell to it. Skin feels nourished after its use.</li>
            <li> I could see a  change in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased from Raw Biology and second review.  I have used Retinol products for a long time and no other product beats this, seriously.  The company claims that &amp;#34;all you need&amp;#34; are the three products - Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin C.  I have the first two products and I believe their claim with all of my heart.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out in hives.</li>
            <li> Incredible customer service! This company is willing to work with you as far as customizing your routine the right way. I was over exfoliating my face so I cut back, was so easy and fast to get help from RB. I couldn&#x27;t ask for any better , I will be a customer for life..This retinol works very well. I also love the Vitamin C. Waiting to try the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> I like it; compares very favorably with the $$$ stuff Mrs. EgusHdus bought off the shopping channels.</li>
            <li> As I have grown older I started noticing age spots not only on my hand but also on my face, since I have started using your retinol 2.5% I have noticed visible difference in just a couple of weeks. Thank you, I will be sure not to ever run out of this product. Julia</li>
            <li> Premium Retinol 2.5% Serum is a fabulous product.  My skin is already glowing with more uniform color. My wrinkles were less visible from the very first day. It is not drying, not oily but just RIGHT. It feels so good on my skin,  which is noticeably smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> This was a good value,both the retinol and vitamin c with hydrologic . So far they seem light weight and go right into the skin and I&#x27;ve had no problem adding them to products I am currently using.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Easily applied and noticed results in 10 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, does everything Retinol is touted to do. I hate to be without it.</li>
