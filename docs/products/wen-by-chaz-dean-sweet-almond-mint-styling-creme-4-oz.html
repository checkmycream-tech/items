            <li>It is a great styling creme.  </li>
            <li>Not as great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love all the Wen products - Wen saved my hair!!</li>
            <li>Tbe WEN styling creme is very kind to my hair.</li>
            <li>I’ve used Paul Mitchell products and Aveda’s Brilliant and Rosemary Mint lines (which I happened to LOVE the Aveda Brilliant line) but that was before Wen came into my life.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing!  </li>
            <li>Just amazing product!</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and good hold.</li>
            <li>The thing is that there are just TOO many great things to say about these products!</li>
            <li>Love this product it makes my hair so great !</li>
            <li>The best product I ever used grew in heathy my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>Good item great price</li>
            <li>Awesome product,  awesome and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Also, it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>fine angel hair and Wen gave my hair incredible body and shine and to top it off my hair smells wonderful</li>
            <li>It has NEVER  looked this good.</li>
            <li>It just did not work for me, which is a shame, because I really liked the shine this product imparted, and how great my hair smelled after using it.</li>
            <li>Good value .Lasts along time.</li>
            <li>It is not my styling product of preference but it can do a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>It controls the frizz from our humid weather fairly well</li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Great product but not cost effective for me.</li>
            <li>so I figured I should continue on my WEN adventure and order the Styling Cream, yes Good decision</li>
            <li>Works good not a fan of the sculpting cream either</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy this doesn&#x27;t take that away like most styling products do.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>So it could be that this is great stuff for healthy, thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use a dime&#x27;s worth of this styling creme and its perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, leaves hair soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If we didn&#x27;t like the product we would not have bought so many times!</li>

            <li>The products keep my hair nice looking and not stringy even after all that time.  </li>
            <li>Marvelous because, I applied some of the cream to one side of my hair just to validate that this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>So happy to find it for such a great price too !!</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but since reading about the lawsuit about hair falling out, I have stopped using these products.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really nice.  </li>
            <li>but I liked the result.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo, however it is also just a good shampoo as this creme is just like many others.</li>
            <li>Kind of spendy, though...</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and great customer serrvice!</li>
            <li>and I do my own cuts.  </li>
            <li>I have nice hair.</li>
            <li>but I know I can always count on amazon to deliver at a very great price, with fast shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found, my hair is frizzy and this product really gets it under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>This is worth every Penny.!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new products for my damaged frizzy hair and am impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice, and has a thick/creamy consistency that feels good to smooth over flyaway strands.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very easy to blow out-</li>
            <li>Best hair product by far!</li>
            <li>the best so far.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent hair care product,  I used to buy from WEN direct.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable -  I have tried so many products and I can honestly say this is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>This by far the BEST shampoo and conditioner that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>John Frieda Frizz Ease hairspray (cheap but good stuff</li>
            <li>(cheap but good stuff)</li>
            <li>My hair type is very fine and shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love this WEN--this item was priced fairly and was shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li>not heavy, mix it with some of the Wen cleansing conditioner and leave it in, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>(And no I am not employed by Wen lol, just a consumer happy with my purchase and felt it necessary to share this for those who have either doubts or interests)  </li>
            <li>I have used Goldwell products, which are very good, but i was intrigued by this new wave of shampoo-less products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light on/in your hair.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it because there is very little perfume to the product and does a great job styling his great hair!</li>
            <li>Most importantly my hair looks and feels very healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked how it holds the style of my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I HAD to order more.  </li>
            <li>After one use my hair look better.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance which is suptle.</li>
            <li>All products I have used, love the almond mint</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about Wen products - my family works in the business, so I grew up with the best hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Wen Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Gave one away, so will need to order more.</li>
            <li>I had some of this styling creme left over after trying the Wen Cleansing Conditioner (which I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with).</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy this product because I heard such wonderful things about it</li>
            <li>and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>Love wen products.</li>
            <li>It comes in better packaging from a tube and not a pump.</li>
            <li>It did an okay job for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for quite some time now and love it.</li>
            <li>REALLY enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li>I never feel compelled to review products because I am never this pleased after a purchase</li>
            <li>I love it all not just the cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product besides the cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>I noticed that the side with the Wen had way more body and volume than the side without.</li>
            <li>I love the shine.</li>
            <li>It works much better.</li>
            <li>I tried many products.</li>
            <li>From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it.</li>
            <li>The smell is also heavenly, not at all like the conditioner, more like a cherry-ish mint smell.</li>
            <li>......highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>I love how it feels in my hair - not greasy or sticky - my hair feels supple and has a lot more body and control than without product.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love all of them, I had never gotten compliments as often as I do since using&lt;br /&gt;Wen.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>this product makes my hair look and  feel so healthy .No</li>
            <li>I love this product my hair is thinning as I am senior citizen and it enables me to use the blow dryer</li>
            <li>In AZ we basically have no humidity, so I&#x27;d be terrified to try this in a more humid climate.</li>
            <li>They both love it to.</li>
            <li>But of course my favorite web site Amazon had it.</li>
            <li>The Wen line has most people raving, but I would guess their pocketbooks are screaming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the way, the TUBE is better than the pump because all of the pump products in the WEN line tend to have issues.</li>
            <li>Bottle, need a minimum of 10 pumps per use and many people use more.</li>
            <li>(Call me cheap!</li>
            <li>and my hair is better.</li>
            <li>100 percent satisfied.....</li>
            <li>I just love how they make my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My Favorite Cleansing conditioner (their version of shampoo) is Pumpkin Ginger.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product glides on when applied and perfectly moisturizes my hair, requiring no further styling products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this before, I love them smell, the fact that it is light and not heavy on your hair, great product!</li>
            <li>I call it my shower door test for build up :)</li>
            <li>two more pumps</li>

            <li>Perfect for mixed hair.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser commented on how much better my hair feels since I have been using the shampoo and the stylign cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this gel for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and you need too many pumps of this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is more affordable than the retailer I&#x27;ve been purchasing from.</li>

            <li>I bought this in the hopes of relieving the frizzy state of my hair and fully trusted that it would work, given that I use and love the WEN Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>ok so I have just joined the WEN Community</li>

            <li>Never disappointed in WEN !</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my wen, this worked great after my wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>They are great products for those seeking more natural alternatives</li>
            <li>WEN will I learn to let good be good enough.</li>
            <li>After it dries it is a great foundation for the face powder that I use and keeps my old face smooth!</li>
            <li>Best product for dry hair!  </li>
            <li>Just ok on my fine hair</li>
            <li>I have generally healthy, medium length, fine hair (and a lot of it).</li>
            <li>Hair has great movement; not stiff or oily.</li>
            <li>Best in wet hair.</li>
            <li>The BEST $30.00 I’ve spent</li>
            <li>Amazon had such an incredible price that I decided to try it....</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft but holds great</li>
            <li>I was reintroduced to the hair that I knew, loved and missed so much.  </li>
            <li>Within about three days, I noticed a significant difference in the quality of my hair; it was shinier, healthier, bouncier, and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the over the top &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; vibe of Chaz, but I have to tell you this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Seems to wash out easily with no residue.</li>
            <li>it comes off easily with water.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth and very easy to use for quick styles.</li>
            <li>used a a conditioner and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>It dries nice and airy and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I love the sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream - have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the BEST leave in product  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, but made my hair feel a bit &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Argon oil would be fine too.</li>
            <li>I have color treated fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and curly and I would not be without this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would reccommend it for fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine and thinning hair and this helps it look thicker and gives it body too</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; have highly recommended it to many that have ordered it &amp; love it also</li>
            <li>Really sets you hair, and gives you more volume then you can imagine!</li>
            <li>It really does deliver I love the smell and the results!</li>
            <li>it was very soft, free moving, &amp; smelled good c:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Wen hair care fan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Wren products.</li>
            <li>Also works well to keep braids smooth and not fly-away.</li>
            <li>It does not add the light oil of a Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>Even second day hair feels great.</li>
            <li>great to give my hair that extra styling need</li>
            <li>So, I will continue to use the Wen Cleansing Conditioner because it works great, but I will stick to my regular gel.</li>
            <li>Feels graet and smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li>The styling cream works great on my short hair.</li>
            <li>The texture of the styling cream is light, not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and have it look the best possible.</li>
            <li>I will never use anything but chaz dean products on my hair again I went from frizzy hair to soft and silky and it smells so good</li>
            <li>I have found that the recommended amount on the WEN products is far in excess of what is needed for the results I want - which is good, because the product lasts longer for me.</li>
            <li>) I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color</li>
            <li>I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color</li>
            <li>My fine hair, which was tangled no matter what shampoo I used, became significantly softer.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel super healthy and super silky.  </li>
            <li>Back to Living Proof Full, which gives great body but does not boost shine.</li>
            <li>This is the second tube of Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme and it has proven to be a great product.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice product!</li>
            <li>Iguess I better buy the shampoo first before I rate it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention my hair grew significantly</li>
            <li>i thought it was the original but is not so there follow your instincts.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves hair styled all day long.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited I sent a starter kit to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I have no cons to report at this time, but I will be sure to update this review as I work my way through my first tube.</li>
            <li>Amazing product does what it says, calms my hair&#x27;s tendency to frizz/curl and is not heavy or greasy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and clean feeling</li>
            <li>It is a great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>They stay very soft to the touch and smell nice.  </li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint Styling Crème by WEN works well on my very frizzy hair, I have found that I do need to use more than is recommended though</li>
            <li>While I like the product, I question if I got a full bottle.</li>
            <li>There was no tab to pull off in order to get product out of container and it wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>is the Sweet Almont Mint Styling Cream.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that I liked this product</li>
            <li>Really dislike to Wen shampoo, but love the styling gel.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I am a die-hard WEN user (the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner, and the Re</li>
            <li>really love his whole system,  </li>
            <li>however for the price and the size of the tube, it was 2/3 of the way full</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a desired effect for frizzy or curly hair but for straight hair it didn&#x27;t help my situation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but, not what it purports either.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and easy to manage my curls love it will recommend this item to every one A+++++</li>
            <li>Scent is mild after blowdrying.</li>
            <li>They are quick to ship</li>
            <li>The price was a lot better than most places that was selling same product.</li>
            <li>Instead, it was super shiny.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does keep my hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>I do use other products, so I cant speak for this on its own, but it is part of my hair routine and my hair is healthy, so I keep using it.</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that this is my very first review ever.</li>
            <li>Well, they should probably change it from 3 weeks to 3 minutes because I kid you not, after my very first wash I noticed a difference in Volume, Body, and Shine immediately.</li>
            <li>It only makes sense- the ph of your hair will love you!</li>
            <li>, I think WEN products are pretty good, however, they tend to leave your hair feeling heavy, this product seems to provide a nice protection after you have washed and conditioned your hair, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and frizzy and this really works.</li>
            <li>This product is a great finisher because it adds shine and a little moisture to soften the gel.</li>
            <li>I have short, fairly fine hair and wanted something that would give me more volume.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else since I discovered WEN products, particularly this Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me!  </li>
            <li>and I really like it&#x27;s light hold.  </li>
            <li>Love it hair feels soft like a child&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love this styling cream as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel icky.  </li>
            <li>I worth it?</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft but if fuller with more body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending extra money if my curly hair looks nice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether I will keep this product in my rotation but it is definitely worth trying for those who are on the fence.</li>
            <li>I got this in the trial size and loved it so much that I ordered the larger one.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It has the right amount of weight and control.</li>
            <li>My mother noticed the difference right away</li>
            <li>and I am eating crow right now.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I also have to wash it every single day or it gets incredibly oily and gross at the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the whole sweet almond mint line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things though about Wen products and decided to add this styling creme to my usual hair care regimen</li>
            <li>Again, I hesitated to add on another product, but decided that the idea of a bit more heat protection and maybe more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t mess me up too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using it everyday right now and love and will order more.</li>
            <li>Most of the other conditioners leave a lot of residue on the door that doesn&#x27;t wash off to easy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Works great, especially with my short curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>By using this tiny bit not only is your hair great</li>
            <li>Wife likes product very much, I just buy it for her.</li>
            <li>I like the Wen Cleansing Conditioner very much, but the gel does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I do not have to use very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This particular product (WEN Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me) is not my favourite, and I will not use this in my hair again.</li>
            <li>While this styling creme smells great and really boosts shine, it made my hair flat and even more limp, which is not the look I want.</li>
            <li>wen sweet almond mint gives my straight hair lots of body and and it feels clean and soft  </li>
            <li>and it IS excellent, but found that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>it down as most products of this type do to my  curly, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it says it will do; I like the smell, the feel and the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, however a dime size portion is more than enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for the quality and results!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was like applying Vasoline to my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this styling creme</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the styling creme.  </li>
            <li>I really did not like thus product!</li>
            <li>My hair was very frizzy!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped on time &amp; it did exactly what it advertised.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in putting some pizzazz on their hair.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t take much!  </li>
            <li>but I went 3 wks without washing my hair after my first wash with Wen.  </li>
            <li>Again, I can only credit Wen because before the Wen I would have never been able to go 3 wks without a wash and still have cooperative, pretty, bouncy hair.</li>
            <li>I love my WEN products and especially like this as my finishing treatment.  </li>
            <li>This helps with moisture and makes my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li>My hair is totally manageable and has regained a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>so I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>first tried the cleansing conditioners because I couldn&#x27;t resist the hype and the idea of simplifying my routine was also seductive.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>At first I just applied a dime sized (quarter sized?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, if they would only have a better price on the cleansing conditioners, which work out to a MINIMUM of $1.50 a use.</li>
            <li>I have tried absolutely every shampoo out there, and this is the one I plan to always use!</li>
            <li>This item makes my hair lightly curly and when you feel your hair it is so soft.</li>
            <li>I would have higher hopes for you if you do not color, perm or relax your hair.</li>
            <li>I have coarse 3c hair and mostly wear my hair in wash and gos.</li>
            <li>:)  Definitely going to buy again; and again, and again, and again...!  </li>
            <li>This is a product I use regularly and love.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that it might work.</li>
            <li>It really really worked!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the feel of it!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Has a good feeling to it, not to sticky, keeps the shape of the &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; so my hair can dry naturally.</li>
            <li>so finding the right hair care has been a challenge my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sweet Almond scent, but it comes in other fragrances.</li>
            <li>just adding Wen Styling Creme to my damp hair straight out of the shower, I have actually been able to skip the entire styling ritual and still have healthy, shiny, fully moisturized hair.  </li>
            <li>It took away all of my frizz for the whole day (and I live in HUMID weather) and left my hair feeling soft and smooth and looking amazing.</li>
            <li>I would definetely recommend this, but buy it off pf wenhaircare.com, as you can get this and other amazing WEN products for $30.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been wonderful for my fine, thin, and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has really &amp;#34;blossomed&amp;#34; using the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, so I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>The whole line of products is wonderful for hair that is getting a little dry from over drying, chemicals, or just from age.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, my common sense says that money could be going to better things (maybe the  victims of the latest disaster, who aren&#x27;t worried about their hair).  </li>
            <li>The first time I followed the instructions and used a large amount</li>
            <li>This is the first times used Wen and I just wanted to try it to see if it really worked and it does.</li>
            <li>Because I have stick straight hair, I used the tiniest, tiniest pea sized amount and just on the ends of my hair the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It was so full, soft and cooperative</li>
            <li>This is good, not sure if needed.  </li>
            <li>I live in Georgia which has been ungodly humid all summer, and recently got a nice new haircut which by the end of my workday would swell out from my head like a mushroom</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair that can easily turn to a frizzy, fluffy nightmare.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would give my hair less of a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and one product has never been enough.</li>
            <li>It enhances the great results of the cleansing conditioner about a hundred times over; it adds moisture, shine, and a light hold to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>I barely have to use any other products to make my hair smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole line!</li>
            <li>I had pretty high expectations for Wen after seeing the info-mercial on TV.</li>
            <li>For my wedding day, my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as I wanted or as smooth or pretty.  </li>
            <li>Using as per instructions was too much product.  </li>
            <li>Advise: buy it from the real source.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very shiny</li>
            <li>It creates straight, shiny, silky hair.</li>
            <li>and it really helps keep my curls stay curly longer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see much difference if I use it or not</li>
            <li>In order to be able to comb through my hair I have to wet it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Not really for hold, more for frizz control.</li>
            <li>but you save so much product.</li>
            <li>Works as heat protectant, not so much at helping to style.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>It real</li>
            <li>it felt very gunked up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>I really like WEN hair products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks WEN</li>
            <li>This product is light and does double duty as a conditioning agent for your hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really support my curls.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep curls together and under control.</li>
            <li>I really like this styling gel a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I would never suggest using as much as the directions say.  </li>
            <li>Really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I get fewer cuts and go to a reasonable salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially it feels like a light weight gel, but then it&#x27;s almost like nothing was applied but water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the curling iron on my hair so much anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like the whole WEN line.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much softer than it has ever been for curly hair.</li>
            <li>wen products have halped my hair tragedy so much</li>
            <li>Really like what it does to my hair</li>
            <li>I am really considering buying it in thier website and automatic shippment.</li>
            <li>It made it straight as a board</li>
            <li>So I guess if you want your hair completely straight that would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>Hair was very frizzy after using this.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li>But the real test was getting out in the weather today.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.....</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this product seems like it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>Even better I can get the product on Amazon for less and it arrives fast!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent product, and now at a REALISTIC price.</li>
            <li>new and sealed exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I would use it again because I use all the other Wen products which I love.  </li>
            <li>and this returned it to a normal looking head of hair!</li>
            <li>I like this product more than the other Zen Products; therefore, I order it separately.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure it does much for frizz, but it makes my hair feel amazingly silky.</li>
            <li>The products besides the Conditioner actually keeps your hair clean too.</li>
            <li>It works well with my fine short hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s long hair; smoothed out her tangles and made it full of body.</li>
            <li>I can do the whole routine quickly now, and I use the  last bits (of the cleansing conditioner) on my hands as a shave</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond Styling creme is never greasy~ simply smooths away stray ends and prevents the damage of using heat to create style.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking - never weighs my hair down .</li>
            <li>I love all Chaz Dean&#x27;s products, because they work on my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>I like it, good for styling, can make hair little oily possibly, don,t know yet</li>
            <li>only solution to decent looking hair has been: wash, condition, mousse/styling creme, full blow dry and then a finishing gel or pomade and maybe a light hairspray to finish.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks, I noticed significant growth of the short, brittle section that was no longer brittle, but soft and much stronger.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair less frizzy &amp; more manageable</li>
            <li>(Just like the Wen Conditioning Cleanser, less is more for me.</li>
            <li>Now, maybe it is because I color treat my hair to cover the gray, and it would work better on hair with less chemical treatments.</li>
            <li>surprised when my hair style held up so well with such light hold.  </li>
            <li>I love the entire line of WEN products , but especially the styling creme.</li>
            <li>and I use only about a dimes amount and that seems more than enough.</li>
            <li>I had never found this particular product in this package before.  </li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper at Amazon and it is delivered much, much faster than if you order directly from WEN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wen Hair Products, this one in particular, for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>Works very well and makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a styling aid, along with wen cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend all the wen products</li>
            <li>Wish it had a little more fragrance.</li>
            <li>I find this works better when I use it mixed with the serum - I also find that I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft shiny yet very manageable.</li>
            <li>I have some gray which tends to &amp;#34;break through&amp;#34; early before I really want to re-color, and the cleansing conditioner seemed to delay that a bit.</li>
            <li>It detangles instantly  and after the hair dries, it is so soft, so full of body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed and glad I had an Amazon balance and didn&#x27;t pay for this with my own money....</li>
            <li>With Wen, this totally ridiculous process using hair spray works even better!</li>
            <li>Love this hair product, makes your hair feel so soft and less frizzy</li>
            <li>I have a large quantity of fine, limp hair that needs a styling product for boosting body and volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d need super size because my hair is so long</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this,  keeps your hair in control and conditioned, not sticky or gooy</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN.</li>
            <li>First off, this is not something I would normally have purchased, but my wife had tried various hair products from WEN and use to get the package order deal.  </li>
            <li>I may be the only person who hasn&#x27;t really seen much of the Wen infomercials.  </li>
            <li>I like that my hair is very soft feeling</li>
            <li>Just on my bangs to soften the curly look I do have to use very much since my hair is a short  almost to my shoulders length.</li>
            <li>It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and leaves my naturally curly hair tame (aka no frizzy ends) and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>At first I just used the cleansing conditioner, with my regular hair product--a creme gel which I used for frizz control.  </li>
            <li>but the only thing that I changed was my hair product and suddenly my hair grows significantly in 2 weeks after one wash and using the Wen products in between.  </li>
            <li>It also adds lift and makes your hair ultra soft!</li>
            <li>And it is not heavy like some others!</li>
            <li>You use just a little bit and your hair can easily be finger combed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme for well over a year and would not go back to regular shampoo for anything.  </li>
            <li>geez a little less greed would be good.</li>
            <li>So bummed that after all the positive &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down&amp;#34; reviews that this was a total flop for me.</li>
            <li>The WEN sweet Almond Mint styling crème doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and goopy feeling like other products do</li>
            <li>I applied this to wet hair before I dried and my hair was so smooth and full once I was done.</li>
            <li>No way for me) to my fine, chin length, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>However, I have always tried to find ways to manage my fine, limp hair that is prone to frizz and dryness.  </li>
            <li>I like this styling Creme because it is not stiff like Hair Jell.  </li>
            <li>So light, I was skeptical that it would work, but it does give volume to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this once I run out of my little 2oz bottle I have now.</li>
            <li>This styling creme really is too heavy for fine hair, even when mixed with a root booster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I washed again with WEN and tried this: I put a little more than recommended of the cleansing conditioner in my hair after rinsing, left it in and combed through.</li>
            <li>would not recommend this product for short, fine, straight hair, however , I could see it working very well for people with corse thick and curly hair</li>
            <li>And unlike so many other products, this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>Super product for long or short hair --- hydrates well, and makes hair manageable and soft!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>He just loves how it make his hair soft.  </li>
            <li>the creme and the spray...both damaged...and old...</li>
            <li>My hair is soft without flyaway</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial and have ethnic hair that I wear natural.  </li>
            <li>It is soft to the touch in my hair.</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to send back one item.</li>
            <li>I believe that all of the products cleanse’ your hair while extracting the natural oils from it.</li>
            <li>I am frequently asked what I do to my hair for it to be so curly and manageable.</li>
            <li>I would advise not buying this product unless it comes from Wen, Chaz Dean or directly sold and shipped via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW .  </li>
            <li>This styling creme keeps my waves intact without any stiffness, leaves it soft and touchable..</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>My hair has natural curl so it can get frizzy.</li>
            <li>my hands weren&#x27;t greasy but soft.  </li>
            <li>i have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>I have over processed hair and this makes it so soft and adds shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>At the same time, it manages my hair very well - do others have this issue?  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky; rather, it smooths my hair, and makes it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is soft &amp; not damaged.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about the style of package.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>Not heavy</li>
            <li>It is so soft too.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product</li>
            <li>I was sure it would work for me and disregarded the negative reviews here, thinking Oh, these ladies must not  have used it correctly.</li>
            <li>Then I applied some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH and combed through.</li>
            <li>next time, I will leave it off and see if there really is a difference.</li>
            <li>I also use a hair color enhancer for my natural brunette hair.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to see if I could get the product without joining the monthly club direct from WEN.</li>
            <li>Even on my second or third day with out a wash my hair is soft and still smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I would rather buy from Amazon than direct from Wen.  </li>
            <li>I have course and thick hair and my hair has been more managable and the softness is a another plus.</li>
            <li>My hair right now is mid back with layers.</li>
            <li>if i plan to put heat on my hair that day, i towel dry my hair until damp and then use the sweet almond mint styling cream pulling it from mid shaft to the tips and then continue to styling.</li>
            <li>but when I flat iron my ethnic naturally curly hair it does stay straight and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Dried light as a feather on my hair and left it still feeling very soft!  </li>
            <li>MAKES IT EASY TO BLOW DRY MY HAIR WITHOUT ANY DRAG WITH THE BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>It still feels clean like I had just washed it and didn&#x27;t add any heavy product after...</li>
            <li>I have found diluting it with a small amount of water helps as I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was going to try it first, but it turned out much more expensive.....</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my hair styled all day long.</li>
            <li>I have very thick naturally curly hair, so I do use more than a &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; for coverage in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product really keeps the fritz down in a high humidity environment.</li>
            <li>I gave dry curly hair  &amp; thus product tames and smooths whether I wear it curly or straight.</li>
            <li>It must work well together because my hair is left feeling so soft &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li>This product I ordered from Morning Beauty was delivered on time, was sealed but the Almond Mint did not smell like the original Wen product I usually use from Wen...</li>
            <li>Only place I found that you could purchase less than the full system.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super greasy and weighed it down a lot.</li>
            <li>old African American female, with a fine grade of hair that is a little pass shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard these days to find a light hold styling cream</li>
            <li>This styling gel has just the right amount of hold for my short hair cut but not greasy like other gels.</li>
            <li>The hair stylibg creme is not really working for fine sraight hair, it made my hair too soft , was not able to style  my hair as i normally do and was not getting any volume as was promised on commercial.</li>
            <li>They are not easy or friendly to deal with and have totally messed up my account with them.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, my hair wasn’t dirty, greasy, and stringy or nothing like it would’ve been normally without a wash.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year  old african american,who has tried every product out there, trying to achieve what this product does for my hair.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>, it’s like a miracle because I have spent so much time and money trying to promote volume, body and shine for my hair and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Short hair remains soft and holds its style.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered a WEN kit directly from the website and recoeved this with the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I brought enough to last the whole year (since it only comes out in the fall) but use the Almond Mint cream because they don&#x27;t have a pumpkin styling cream.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how it made my hair feel.. Would consider future purchases.</li>
            <li>it brought back a lot of my natural curl and what a help.  </li>
            <li>My naturally curly coarse hair loves this styling crème.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft enough and styling hold isn&#x27;t what I would like.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, just right</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the previous product I had</li>
            <li>No easy task and worth every penny</li>
            <li>Compare prices of other styling crèmes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t expect much &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, not a gel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these products anymore as I don&#x27;t like them as much as the Argan oil products from other companies.</li>
            <li>This is the first product line I have found (outside of salon styling) that tames those wild hairs and keeps them in place without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li>This enables me to simply wet my hair, apply a little of the styling creme (more like a gel), scrunch my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I love natural products and this product has a weird smell.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law recommended WEN when she spotted my poor bangs and said she&#x27;d used some sample products a few months before and loved them.  </li>
            <li>It makes my frizzy, dry, wavy hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, very curly, very frizzy, color-treated hair, and I live in a humid climate (central Florida).</li>
            <li>hair is fine but with the strange phenomenon of seeming thick and bushy in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It stops frizz without weighing my hair down too much</li>
            <li>really weighed down.  </li>
            <li>The WEN Styling Creme definitely helps, it doesn&#x27;t take very much, follow directions just need to use a little from mid to tip of hair.  </li>
            <li>Then for me, it kept my hair soft after a blow dry</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li>I HAVE THIN, FINE HAIR AND THE STYLING CREME</li>
            <li>I used a little more than a quarter size amount but only because my hair is thick an curly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> It is a great styling creme.  </li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love all the Wen products - Wen saved my hair!!</li>
            <li> Tbe WEN styling creme is very kind to my hair.</li>
            <li> I’ve used Paul Mitchell products and Aveda’s Brilliant and Rosemary Mint lines (which I happened to LOVE the Aveda Brilliant line) but that was before Wen came into my life.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing!  </li>
            <li> Just amazing product!</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and good hold.</li>
            <li> The thing is that there are just TOO many great things to say about these products!</li>
            <li> Love this product it makes my hair so great !</li>
            <li> The best product I ever used grew in heathy my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> Good item great price</li>
            <li> Awesome product,  awesome and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Also, it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> fine angel hair and Wen gave my hair incredible body and shine and to top it off my hair smells wonderful</li>
            <li> It has NEVER  looked this good.</li>
            <li> It just did not work for me, which is a shame, because I really liked the shine this product imparted, and how great my hair smelled after using it.</li>
            <li> Good value .Lasts along time.</li>
            <li> It is not my styling product of preference but it can do a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> It controls the frizz from our humid weather fairly well</li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great product but not cost effective for me.</li>
            <li> so I figured I should continue on my WEN adventure and order the Styling Cream, yes Good decision</li>
            <li> Works good not a fan of the sculpting cream either</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy this doesn&#x27;t take that away like most styling products do.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> So it could be that this is great stuff for healthy, thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use a dime&#x27;s worth of this styling creme and its perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> If we didn&#x27;t like the product we would not have bought so many times!</li>

            <li> The products keep my hair nice looking and not stringy even after all that time.  </li>
            <li> Marvelous because, I applied some of the cream to one side of my hair just to validate that this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> So happy to find it for such a great price too !!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but since reading about the lawsuit about hair falling out, I have stopped using these products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice.  </li>
            <li> but I liked the result.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, however it is also just a good shampoo as this creme is just like many others.</li>
            <li> Kind of spendy, though...</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and great customer serrvice!</li>
            <li> and I do my own cuts.  </li>
            <li> I have nice hair.</li>
            <li> but I know I can always count on amazon to deliver at a very great price, with fast shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found, my hair is frizzy and this product really gets it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This is worth every Penny.!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new products for my damaged frizzy hair and am impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice, and has a thick/creamy consistency that feels good to smooth over flyaway strands.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very easy to blow out-</li>
            <li> Best hair product by far!</li>
            <li> the best so far.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair care product,  I used to buy from WEN direct.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable -  I have tried so many products and I can honestly say this is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This by far the BEST shampoo and conditioner that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease hairspray (cheap but good stuff</li>
            <li> (cheap but good stuff)</li>
            <li> My hair type is very fine and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this WEN--this item was priced fairly and was shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> not heavy, mix it with some of the Wen cleansing conditioner and leave it in, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> (And no I am not employed by Wen lol, just a consumer happy with my purchase and felt it necessary to share this for those who have either doubts or interests)  </li>
            <li> I have used Goldwell products, which are very good, but i was intrigued by this new wave of shampoo-less products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light on/in your hair.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it because there is very little perfume to the product and does a great job styling his great hair!</li>
            <li> Most importantly my hair looks and feels very healthy.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked how it holds the style of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I HAD to order more.  </li>
            <li> After one use my hair look better.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance which is suptle.</li>
            <li> All products I have used, love the almond mint</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about Wen products - my family works in the business, so I grew up with the best hair care products.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Wen Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Gave one away, so will need to order more.</li>
            <li> I had some of this styling creme left over after trying the Wen Cleansing Conditioner (which I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with).</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product because I heard such wonderful things about it</li>
            <li> and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love wen products.</li>
            <li> It comes in better packaging from a tube and not a pump.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used to love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite some time now and love it.</li>
            <li> REALLY enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li> I never feel compelled to review products because I am never this pleased after a purchase</li>
            <li> I love it all not just the cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My favorite product besides the cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> I noticed that the side with the Wen had way more body and volume than the side without.</li>
            <li> I love the shine.</li>
            <li> It works much better.</li>
            <li> I tried many products.</li>
            <li> From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it.</li>
            <li> The smell is also heavenly, not at all like the conditioner, more like a cherry-ish mint smell.</li>
            <li> ......highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> I love how it feels in my hair - not greasy or sticky - my hair feels supple and has a lot more body and control than without product.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love all of them, I had never gotten compliments as often as I do since using&lt;br /&gt;Wen.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> this product makes my hair look and  feel so healthy .No</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair is thinning as I am senior citizen and it enables me to use the blow dryer</li>
            <li> In AZ we basically have no humidity, so I&#x27;d be terrified to try this in a more humid climate.</li>
            <li> They both love it to.</li>
            <li> But of course my favorite web site Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> The Wen line has most people raving, but I would guess their pocketbooks are screaming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the way, the TUBE is better than the pump because all of the pump products in the WEN line tend to have issues.</li>
            <li> Bottle, need a minimum of 10 pumps per use and many people use more.</li>
            <li> (Call me cheap!</li>
            <li> and my hair is better.</li>
            <li> 100 percent satisfied.....</li>
            <li> I just love how they make my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My Favorite Cleansing conditioner (their version of shampoo) is Pumpkin Ginger.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product glides on when applied and perfectly moisturizes my hair, requiring no further styling products.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this before, I love them smell, the fact that it is light and not heavy on your hair, great product!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff and what it does for my hair.</li>

            <li> I love all of his products.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes of relieving the frizzy state of my hair and fully trusted that it would work, given that I use and love the WEN Cleansing Conditioner.</li>

            <li> They are great products for those seeking more natural alternatives</li>
            <li> WEN will I learn to let good be good enough.</li>
            <li> After it dries it is a great foundation for the face powder that I use and keeps my old face smooth!</li>
            <li> Best product for dry hair!  </li>
            <li> Just ok on my fine hair</li>
            <li> I have generally healthy, medium length, fine hair (and a lot of it).</li>
            <li> Hair has great movement; not stiff or oily.</li>
            <li> Best in wet hair.</li>
            <li> The BEST $30.00 I’ve spent</li>
            <li> Amazon had such an incredible price that I decided to try it....</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft but holds great</li>
            <li> I was reintroduced to the hair that I knew, loved and missed so much.  </li>
            <li> Within about three days, I noticed a significant difference in the quality of my hair; it was shinier, healthier, bouncier, and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the over the top &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; vibe of Chaz, but I have to tell you this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Seems to wash out easily with no residue.</li>
            <li> it comes off easily with water.  </li>
            <li> It feels smooth and very easy to use for quick styles.</li>
            <li> used a a conditioner and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> It dries nice and airy and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I love the sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream - have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the BEST leave in product  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, but made my hair feel a bit &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Argon oil would be fine too.</li>
            <li> I have color treated fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and curly and I would not be without this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would reccommend it for fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine and thinning hair and this helps it look thicker and gives it body too</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; have highly recommended it to many that have ordered it &amp; love it also</li>
            <li> Really sets you hair, and gives you more volume then you can imagine!</li>
            <li> It really does deliver I love the smell and the results!</li>
            <li> it was very soft, free moving, &amp; smelled good c:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Wen hair care fan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Wren products.</li>
            <li> Also works well to keep braids smooth and not fly-away.</li>
            <li> It does not add the light oil of a Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Even second day hair feels great.</li>
            <li> great to give my hair that extra styling need</li>
            <li> So, I will continue to use the Wen Cleansing Conditioner because it works great, but I will stick to my regular gel.</li>
            <li> Feels graet and smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li> The styling cream works great on my short hair.</li>
            <li> The texture of the styling cream is light, not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and have it look the best possible.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything but chaz dean products on my hair again I went from frizzy hair to soft and silky and it smells so good</li>
            <li> I have found that the recommended amount on the WEN products is far in excess of what is needed for the results I want - which is good, because the product lasts longer for me.</li>
            <li> ) I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color</li>
            <li> I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color</li>
            <li> My fine hair, which was tangled no matter what shampoo I used, became significantly softer.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel super healthy and super silky.  </li>
            <li> Back to Living Proof Full, which gives great body but does not boost shine.</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme and it has proven to be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice product!</li>
            <li> Iguess I better buy the shampoo first before I rate it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention my hair grew significantly</li>
            <li> i thought it was the original but is not so there follow your instincts.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves hair styled all day long.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited I sent a starter kit to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I have no cons to report at this time, but I will be sure to update this review as I work my way through my first tube.</li>
            <li> Amazing product does what it says, calms my hair&#x27;s tendency to frizz/curl and is not heavy or greasy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and clean feeling</li>
            <li> It is a great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> They stay very soft to the touch and smell nice.  </li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint Styling Crème by WEN works well on my very frizzy hair, I have found that I do need to use more than is recommended though</li>
            <li> While I like the product, I question if I got a full bottle.</li>
            <li> There was no tab to pull off in order to get product out of container and it wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> is the Sweet Almont Mint Styling Cream.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that I liked this product</li>
            <li> Really dislike to Wen shampoo, but love the styling gel.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I am a die-hard WEN user (the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner, and the Re</li>
            <li> really love his whole system,  </li>
            <li> however for the price and the size of the tube, it was 2/3 of the way full</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a desired effect for frizzy or curly hair but for straight hair it didn&#x27;t help my situation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but, not what it purports either.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and easy to manage my curls love it will recommend this item to every one A+++++</li>
            <li> Scent is mild after blowdrying.</li>
            <li> They are quick to ship</li>
            <li> The price was a lot better than most places that was selling same product.</li>
            <li> Instead, it was super shiny.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does keep my hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li> I do use other products, so I cant speak for this on its own, but it is part of my hair routine and my hair is healthy, so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that this is my very first review ever.</li>
            <li> Well, they should probably change it from 3 weeks to 3 minutes because I kid you not, after my very first wash I noticed a difference in Volume, Body, and Shine immediately.</li>
            <li> It only makes sense- the ph of your hair will love you!</li>
            <li> , I think WEN products are pretty good, however, they tend to leave your hair feeling heavy, this product seems to provide a nice protection after you have washed and conditioned your hair, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and frizzy and this really works.</li>
            <li> This product is a great finisher because it adds shine and a little moisture to soften the gel.</li>
            <li> I have short, fairly fine hair and wanted something that would give me more volume.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else since I discovered WEN products, particularly this Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me!  </li>
            <li> and I really like it&#x27;s light hold.  </li>
            <li> Love it hair feels soft like a child&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this styling cream as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel icky.  </li>
            <li> I worth it?</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft but if fuller with more body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending extra money if my curly hair looks nice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I will keep this product in my rotation but it is definitely worth trying for those who are on the fence.</li>
            <li> I got this in the trial size and loved it so much that I ordered the larger one.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It has the right amount of weight and control.</li>
            <li> My mother noticed the difference right away</li>
            <li> and I am eating crow right now.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I also have to wash it every single day or it gets incredibly oily and gross at the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the whole sweet almond mint line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things though about Wen products and decided to add this styling creme to my usual hair care regimen</li>
            <li> Again, I hesitated to add on another product, but decided that the idea of a bit more heat protection and maybe more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t mess me up too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday right now and love and will order more.</li>
            <li> Most of the other conditioners leave a lot of residue on the door that doesn&#x27;t wash off to easy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works great, especially with my short curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> By using this tiny bit not only is your hair great</li>
            <li> Wife likes product very much, I just buy it for her.</li>
            <li> I like the Wen Cleansing Conditioner very much, but the gel does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I do not have to use very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This particular product (WEN Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me) is not my favourite, and I will not use this in my hair again.</li>
            <li> While this styling creme smells great and really boosts shine, it made my hair flat and even more limp, which is not the look I want.</li>
            <li> wen sweet almond mint gives my straight hair lots of body and and it feels clean and soft  </li>
            <li> and it IS excellent, but found that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it down as most products of this type do to my  curly, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it will do; I like the smell, the feel and the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, however a dime size portion is more than enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced for the quality and results!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was like applying Vasoline to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this styling creme</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the styling creme.  </li>
            <li> I really did not like thus product!</li>
            <li> My hair was very frizzy!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped on time &amp; it did exactly what it advertised.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in putting some pizzazz on their hair.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t take much!  </li>
            <li> but I went 3 wks without washing my hair after my first wash with Wen.  </li>
            <li> Again, I can only credit Wen because before the Wen I would have never been able to go 3 wks without a wash and still have cooperative, pretty, bouncy hair.</li>
            <li> I love my WEN products and especially like this as my finishing treatment.  </li>
            <li> This helps with moisture and makes my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li> My hair is totally manageable and has regained a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> so I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> first tried the cleansing conditioners because I couldn&#x27;t resist the hype and the idea of simplifying my routine was also seductive.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> At first I just applied a dime sized (quarter sized?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if they would only have a better price on the cleansing conditioners, which work out to a MINIMUM of $1.50 a use.</li>
            <li> I have tried absolutely every shampoo out there, and this is the one I plan to always use!</li>
            <li> This item makes my hair lightly curly and when you feel your hair it is so soft.</li>
            <li> I would have higher hopes for you if you do not color, perm or relax your hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse 3c hair and mostly wear my hair in wash and gos.</li>
            <li> :)  Definitely going to buy again; and again, and again, and again...!  </li>
            <li> This is a product I use regularly and love.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that it might work.</li>
            <li> It really really worked!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the feel of it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of hair care products.  </li>
            <li> Has a good feeling to it, not to sticky, keeps the shape of the &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; so my hair can dry naturally.</li>
            <li> so finding the right hair care has been a challenge my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sweet Almond scent, but it comes in other fragrances.</li>
            <li> just adding Wen Styling Creme to my damp hair straight out of the shower, I have actually been able to skip the entire styling ritual and still have healthy, shiny, fully moisturized hair.  </li>
            <li> It took away all of my frizz for the whole day (and I live in HUMID weather) and left my hair feeling soft and smooth and looking amazing.</li>
            <li> I would definetely recommend this, but buy it off pf wenhaircare.com, as you can get this and other amazing WEN products for $30.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been wonderful for my fine, thin, and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has really &amp;#34;blossomed&amp;#34; using the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, so I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> The whole line of products is wonderful for hair that is getting a little dry from over drying, chemicals, or just from age.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, my common sense says that money could be going to better things (maybe the  victims of the latest disaster, who aren&#x27;t worried about their hair).  </li>
            <li> The first time I followed the instructions and used a large amount</li>
            <li> This is the first times used Wen and I just wanted to try it to see if it really worked and it does.</li>
            <li> Because I have stick straight hair, I used the tiniest, tiniest pea sized amount and just on the ends of my hair the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It was so full, soft and cooperative</li>
            <li> This is good, not sure if needed.  </li>
            <li> I live in Georgia which has been ungodly humid all summer, and recently got a nice new haircut which by the end of my workday would swell out from my head like a mushroom</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair that can easily turn to a frizzy, fluffy nightmare.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would give my hair less of a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and one product has never been enough.</li>
            <li> It enhances the great results of the cleansing conditioner about a hundred times over; it adds moisture, shine, and a light hold to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I barely have to use any other products to make my hair smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole line!</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations for Wen after seeing the info-mercial on TV.</li>
            <li> For my wedding day, my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as I wanted or as smooth or pretty.  </li>
            <li> Using as per instructions was too much product.  </li>
            <li> Advise: buy it from the real source.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very shiny</li>
            <li> It creates straight, shiny, silky hair.</li>
            <li> and it really helps keep my curls stay curly longer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see much difference if I use it or not</li>
            <li> In order to be able to comb through my hair I have to wet it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not really for hold, more for frizz control.</li>
            <li> but you save so much product.</li>
            <li> Works as heat protectant, not so much at helping to style.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> It real</li>
            <li> it felt very gunked up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I really like WEN hair products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks WEN</li>
            <li> This product is light and does double duty as a conditioning agent for your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really support my curls.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep curls together and under control.</li>
            <li> I really like this styling gel a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I would never suggest using as much as the directions say.  </li>
            <li> Really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I get fewer cuts and go to a reasonable salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially it feels like a light weight gel, but then it&#x27;s almost like nothing was applied but water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the curling iron on my hair so much anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like the whole WEN line.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much softer than it has ever been for curly hair.</li>
            <li> wen products have halped my hair tragedy so much</li>
            <li> Really like what it does to my hair</li>
            <li> I am really considering buying it in thier website and automatic shippment.</li>
            <li> It made it straight as a board</li>
            <li> So I guess if you want your hair completely straight that would be helpful.  </li>
            <li> Hair was very frizzy after using this.</li>
            <li> Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li> But the real test was getting out in the weather today.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.....</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this product seems like it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> Even better I can get the product on Amazon for less and it arrives fast!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product, and now at a REALISTIC price.</li>
            <li> new and sealed exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I would use it again because I use all the other Wen products which I love.  </li>
            <li> and this returned it to a normal looking head of hair!</li>
            <li> I like this product more than the other Zen Products; therefore, I order it separately.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure it does much for frizz, but it makes my hair feel amazingly silky.</li>
            <li> The products besides the Conditioner actually keeps your hair clean too.</li>
            <li> It works well with my fine short hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s long hair; smoothed out her tangles and made it full of body.</li>
            <li> I can do the whole routine quickly now, and I use the  last bits (of the cleansing conditioner) on my hands as a shave</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Styling creme is never greasy~ simply smooths away stray ends and prevents the damage of using heat to create style.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking - never weighs my hair down .</li>
            <li> I love all Chaz Dean&#x27;s products, because they work on my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like it, good for styling, can make hair little oily possibly, don,t know yet</li>
            <li> only solution to decent looking hair has been: wash, condition, mousse/styling creme, full blow dry and then a finishing gel or pomade and maybe a light hairspray to finish.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks, I noticed significant growth of the short, brittle section that was no longer brittle, but soft and much stronger.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair less frizzy &amp; more manageable</li>
            <li> (Just like the Wen Conditioning Cleanser, less is more for me.</li>
            <li> Now, maybe it is because I color treat my hair to cover the gray, and it would work better on hair with less chemical treatments.</li>
            <li> surprised when my hair style held up so well with such light hold.  </li>
            <li> I love the entire line of WEN products , but especially the styling creme.</li>
            <li> and I use only about a dimes amount and that seems more than enough.</li>
            <li> I had never found this particular product in this package before.  </li>
            <li> The price is much cheaper at Amazon and it is delivered much, much faster than if you order directly from WEN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Hair Products, this one in particular, for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a styling aid, along with wen cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend all the wen products</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little more fragrance.</li>
            <li> I find this works better when I use it mixed with the serum - I also find that I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft shiny yet very manageable.</li>
            <li> I have some gray which tends to &amp;#34;break through&amp;#34; early before I really want to re-color, and the cleansing conditioner seemed to delay that a bit.</li>
            <li> It detangles instantly  and after the hair dries, it is so soft, so full of body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed and glad I had an Amazon balance and didn&#x27;t pay for this with my own money....</li>
            <li> With Wen, this totally ridiculous process using hair spray works even better!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product, makes your hair feel so soft and less frizzy</li>
            <li> I have a large quantity of fine, limp hair that needs a styling product for boosting body and volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d need super size because my hair is so long</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this,  keeps your hair in control and conditioned, not sticky or gooy</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not something I would normally have purchased, but my wife had tried various hair products from WEN and use to get the package order deal.  </li>
            <li> I may be the only person who hasn&#x27;t really seen much of the Wen infomercials.  </li>
            <li> I like that my hair is very soft feeling</li>
            <li> Just on my bangs to soften the curly look I do have to use very much since my hair is a short  almost to my shoulders length.</li>
            <li> It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and leaves my naturally curly hair tame (aka no frizzy ends) and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> At first I just used the cleansing conditioner, with my regular hair product--a creme gel which I used for frizz control.  </li>
            <li> but the only thing that I changed was my hair product and suddenly my hair grows significantly in 2 weeks after one wash and using the Wen products in between.  </li>
            <li> It also adds lift and makes your hair ultra soft!</li>
            <li> And it is not heavy like some others!</li>
            <li> You use just a little bit and your hair can easily be finger combed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme for well over a year and would not go back to regular shampoo for anything.  </li>
            <li> geez a little less greed would be good.</li>
            <li> So bummed that after all the positive &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down&amp;#34; reviews that this was a total flop for me.</li>
            <li> The WEN sweet Almond Mint styling crème doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and goopy feeling like other products do</li>
            <li> I applied this to wet hair before I dried and my hair was so smooth and full once I was done.</li>
            <li> No way for me) to my fine, chin length, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> However, I have always tried to find ways to manage my fine, limp hair that is prone to frizz and dryness.  </li>
            <li> I like this styling Creme because it is not stiff like Hair Jell.  </li>
            <li> So light, I was skeptical that it would work, but it does give volume to fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this once I run out of my little 2oz bottle I have now.</li>
            <li> This styling creme really is too heavy for fine hair, even when mixed with a root booster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I washed again with WEN and tried this: I put a little more than recommended of the cleansing conditioner in my hair after rinsing, left it in and combed through.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product for short, fine, straight hair, however , I could see it working very well for people with corse thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> And unlike so many other products, this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Super product for long or short hair --- hydrates well, and makes hair manageable and soft!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> He just loves how it make his hair soft.  </li>
            <li> the creme and the spray...both damaged...and old...</li>
            <li> My hair is soft without flyaway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have ethnic hair that I wear natural.  </li>
            <li> It is soft to the touch in my hair.</li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to send back one item.</li>
            <li> I believe that all of the products cleanse’ your hair while extracting the natural oils from it.</li>
            <li> I am frequently asked what I do to my hair for it to be so curly and manageable.</li>
            <li> I would advise not buying this product unless it comes from Wen, Chaz Dean or directly sold and shipped via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW .  </li>
            <li> This styling creme keeps my waves intact without any stiffness, leaves it soft and touchable..</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair has natural curl so it can get frizzy.</li>
            <li> my hands weren&#x27;t greasy but soft.  </li>
            <li> i have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> I have over processed hair and this makes it so soft and adds shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, it manages my hair very well - do others have this issue?  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky; rather, it smooths my hair, and makes it soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is soft &amp; not damaged.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about the style of package.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Not heavy</li>
            <li> It is so soft too.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product</li>
            <li> I was sure it would work for me and disregarded the negative reviews here, thinking Oh, these ladies must not  have used it correctly.</li>
            <li> Then I applied some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH and combed through.</li>
            <li> next time, I will leave it off and see if there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> I also use a hair color enhancer for my natural brunette hair.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to see if I could get the product without joining the monthly club direct from WEN.</li>
            <li> Even on my second or third day with out a wash my hair is soft and still smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I would rather buy from Amazon than direct from Wen.  </li>
            <li> I have course and thick hair and my hair has been more managable and the softness is a another plus.</li>
            <li> My hair right now is mid back with layers.</li>
            <li> if i plan to put heat on my hair that day, i towel dry my hair until damp and then use the sweet almond mint styling cream pulling it from mid shaft to the tips and then continue to styling.</li>
            <li> but when I flat iron my ethnic naturally curly hair it does stay straight and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Dried light as a feather on my hair and left it still feeling very soft!  </li>
            <li> MAKES IT EASY TO BLOW DRY MY HAIR WITHOUT ANY DRAG WITH THE BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> It still feels clean like I had just washed it and didn&#x27;t add any heavy product after...</li>
            <li> I have found diluting it with a small amount of water helps as I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was going to try it first, but it turned out much more expensive.....</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my hair styled all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair, so I do use more than a &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; for coverage in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps the fritz down in a high humidity environment.</li>
            <li> I gave dry curly hair  &amp; thus product tames and smooths whether I wear it curly or straight.</li>
            <li> It must work well together because my hair is left feeling so soft &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li> This product I ordered from Morning Beauty was delivered on time, was sealed but the Almond Mint did not smell like the original Wen product I usually use from Wen...</li>
            <li> Only place I found that you could purchase less than the full system.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super greasy and weighed it down a lot.</li>
            <li> old African American female, with a fine grade of hair that is a little pass shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard these days to find a light hold styling cream</li>
            <li> This styling gel has just the right amount of hold for my short hair cut but not greasy like other gels.</li>
            <li> The hair stylibg creme is not really working for fine sraight hair, it made my hair too soft , was not able to style  my hair as i normally do and was not getting any volume as was promised on commercial.</li>
            <li> They are not easy or friendly to deal with and have totally messed up my account with them.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, my hair wasn’t dirty, greasy, and stringy or nothing like it would’ve been normally without a wash.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year  old african american,who has tried every product out there, trying to achieve what this product does for my hair.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> , it’s like a miracle because I have spent so much time and money trying to promote volume, body and shine for my hair and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Short hair remains soft and holds its style.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered a WEN kit directly from the website and recoeved this with the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I brought enough to last the whole year (since it only comes out in the fall) but use the Almond Mint cream because they don&#x27;t have a pumpkin styling cream.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how it made my hair feel.. Would consider future purchases.</li>
            <li> it brought back a lot of my natural curl and what a help.  </li>
            <li> My naturally curly coarse hair loves this styling crème.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft enough and styling hold isn&#x27;t what I would like.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, just right</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the previous product I had</li>
            <li> No easy task and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Compare prices of other styling crèmes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t expect much &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, not a gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these products anymore as I don&#x27;t like them as much as the Argan oil products from other companies.</li>
            <li> This is the first product line I have found (outside of salon styling) that tames those wild hairs and keeps them in place without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> This enables me to simply wet my hair, apply a little of the styling creme (more like a gel), scrunch my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I love natural products and this product has a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law recommended WEN when she spotted my poor bangs and said she&#x27;d used some sample products a few months before and loved them.  </li>
            <li> It makes my frizzy, dry, wavy hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, very frizzy, color-treated hair, and I live in a humid climate (central Florida).</li>
            <li> hair is fine but with the strange phenomenon of seeming thick and bushy in the humidity.</li>
            <li> It stops frizz without weighing my hair down too much</li>
            <li> really weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The WEN Styling Creme definitely helps, it doesn&#x27;t take very much, follow directions just need to use a little from mid to tip of hair.  </li>
            <li> Then for me, it kept my hair soft after a blow dry</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li> I HAVE THIN, FINE HAIR AND THE STYLING CREME</li>
            <li> I used a little more than a quarter size amount but only because my hair is thick an curly.  </li>
            <li> , I love the control it gives me the shine and hold without the icky sticky stiff feel.</li>
            <li> STYLING creme is only costing me about 25 cents a time, maybe less, so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon is considerably cheaper than any other outlet I have found online.  </li>
            <li> But only one thing, if you use it everday, it makes your hair look flat.</li>
            <li> whether I let it dry naturally or blow dry it!</li>
            <li> Makes styling your hair so much easier and my hair is so dry and dead looking</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s right up there with the other products which have failed to give me consistent and glowing results.</li>
            <li> Not pleased...left hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li> Because the curliness was out of control and some of the curls were flat.</li>
            <li> As long as the price stays low, I will continue to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it ends up flat and oily.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and my hair does not feel weighted down.</li>
            <li> I have real short hair so after I blow it dry I put some of the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair less frizzy and natural looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and kinky which I presently wear straight with color.</li>
            <li> My hair which has been dry lately with a little frizz was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Her hair is dark, super Thick and tends to get frizzy in the humidity in Texas.</li>
            <li> For my short hair it works well to style it without it feeling dry and laso gives it body as well!</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use 3 times that much for other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I have really think hair and before I started using it, it was so hard to comb my hair out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really help when you have ends that are hard to run your finger thru .  </li>
            <li> Ive tried lots and lots cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> They say a quarter size amount--maybe that&#x27;s for really long hair?  </li>
            <li> With heavy thunderstorms this morning through early afternoon I was dubious.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it does not weigh my hair down; so that if I do not wash my hair the next day it does not look oily and \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell stayed in my hair for a long time and normally straightening balm usually wear off after I dry it.</li>
            <li> I actually did what they said: kept tube in shower, after cleansing, etc., applied less than a dime sized amount to dripping hair - mid shaft and ends.</li>
            <li> i have dry curly long hair....</li>
            <li> Creates soft curls and helps tame frizz.</li>
            <li> One thing, I also use the WEN cleanser, so I do not know if this gel will work the same with other shampoos and/or conditioners.</li>
            <li> Prefer this over many expensive brands!</li>
            <li> but yet it gives it enough body that I don&#x27;t have to do a lot of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it went above or beyond other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have VERY long hair</li>
            <li> spray humidifying hair spray on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry immediately.</li>
            <li> so is on the dry side</li>
            <li> Adds moisture and keeps my curly, dry, frizzy hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> and can you put a price limit on a product that gives your style hold, body and smooths out dry areas?</li>
            <li> I held my breath, blew my hair dry, styled it</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Did not affect dry time, shine, or frizz.  </li>
            <li> My hair held the style, only swelled a tiny bit and with a few spritzes of</li>
            <li> and I am mixed (half african american and half caucasian)</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders, dry as the Sahara (except for Wen&#x27;s Conditioning Cleaner which has made it soft and manageable)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with styling cremes, but this one is very manageable &amp; workable for me.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with thick, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Prior to using WEN, I was using about five different products on a daily basis to get my thick, frizzy, curly/wavy hair under control.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: a bit more shine and body, and I feel a little less guilty when I use the flat</li>
            <li> It does not leave hair feeling weighed down or greasy - even on the second day of unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> I work outside (dog walker) and so have had the sun beating down on my hair all summer.</li>
            <li> Though the product last a very long time my budget is tight.</li>
            <li> i keep this product in the shower and apply it to dripping wet hair and let my hair air dry....</li>
            <li> I use it on wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> application is totally different from typical products, so please follow.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser worked some magic to hide the short, brittle sections of my bangs that had literally broken off a few weeks before (probably from stress and poor diet habits for the months leading up to the big day).  </li>
            <li> Black white and a little native American in there.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde hair that gets dry from swimming everyday...</li>
            <li> Only need a little and the little hole delivers just enough.</li>
            <li> it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels lightweight, but my hair looked pathetic.    </li>
            <li> So far, she hasn&#x27;t had a complaint about any of the WEN products she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> gets too heavy for me, even with ll the coarse hair I have.</li>
            <li> I have only been using WEN products a few months.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Although yesterday my hair got wet</li>
            <li> Just putting a couple of drops and leaving in my wet hair has been doing wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I should just buy extra when I can because I waste money on other products.</li>
            <li> The other side looked flat and limp.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair &amp; I only use about a dime size of the creme.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems very much like the products I have picked up at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> I like the reviews that other users gave.  </li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this over other styling Gels</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this to keep your frizzy hairs from attempting to escape.</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby boys curls neat and doesn&#x27;t give him cradle cap like other products I was using.</li>
            <li> I have used other WEN products and felt they were so so.  </li>
            <li> I split hair down the center and apply a pea size to each section.</li>
            <li> Item was very old and the sealed broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste a single penny on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Of course my hair is thin and someone with long thick hair will need that much.  </li>
            <li> At $30+ when you add in shipping, do that math!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am active and work out, so I feel the need to cleanse my hair/scalp at least every other day (daily in summer), as no product is going to stop the effects of sweat.</li>
            <li> I stopped using WEN shampoo/conditioner after a few months as my hair became very dry.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product my hair has been flat, limp, and boring for about 4 or more yrs.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I will not return it because it is not worth my time and money....</li>
            <li> but I have really thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It holds the curl in my hair all day without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and does help with the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It controls my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I am down to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> This beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li> I even had to wear a ton on a humid day, and my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down or anything.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your style or make it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> SO THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T WASH DOWN THE DRAIN.  </li>
            <li> Other products have always been to heavy and weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> But regardless of that, I used less and less product each day to see if it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and a half and just put in a refill order.</li>
            <li> Since I no longer needed to aggressively detangle, there was less breakage and damage, so my hair seemed to grow faster and stay healthier, despite coloring it.</li>
            <li> how I can manage my hair easier with less work.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that if you use Wen and you don&#x27;t have real long or real thick hair, only use about half of what the directions call for.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair with a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> I am a little embarrassed to say this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how little I put on</li>
            <li> ; stuff on it to shape it up and maybe a little hair spray</li>
            <li> A little pricey,</li>
            <li> As they say, a little dab will do you.  </li>
            <li> Was prepared for my hair to feel a little limp with this product, but that&#x27;s not what has happened.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that its hard to wash out....</li>
            <li> I forgot to put this on my hair this morning, and when I dried my hair, it stood out 10 frizzy inches around my head.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is my advice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, this styling creme is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it wasn&#x27;t greasy or make my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this n my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This review process is really a waste of my time.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy and it felt sticky all day.  </li>
            <li> too heavy. .wen</li>
            <li> this cream is also too heavy.</li>
            <li> frizz or dried ends.</li>
            <li> me too, but it does go away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> What a shame and what a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But no matter how small of an amount I used, it weighed my hair down to the point of me not wanting to use it.  </li>
            <li> Use as directed, sometimes if your hair is shorter I would use less than the recommended amount, but this stuff makes my hair silky!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but it helps control frizz.</li>
            <li> I have curly unruly hair and this product came tame it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not bad for the price, I thought at first.</li>
            <li> However I used the amount indicated and it took a little while longer than normal to dry my hair, which is annoying</li>
            <li> It also left my hair unable to style once blow dried.  </li>
            <li> Even using very little did not satisfy the outcome of my hairstyle</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and did not expect my hair to look so bad</li>
            <li> I usually wash it every two to three days with the WEN cleansing conditioner then before combing it</li>
            <li> Not sure if they changed the ingredients.</li>
            <li> it’s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Wen products but not for everyday use!</li>
            <li> and I usually have to straighten it again before the week is over.</li>
            <li> I like this product, just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Then I styled as usual.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my hair make my hair sticky &amp; nasty, but it felt fine</li>
            <li> It made my hair hard and brittle, did not do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, the smell is hard to get over.</li>
            <li> The hair is a bite dull looking after using it.</li>
            <li> When this styling creme arrived, I could hardly wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Negative side-</li>
            <li> I guess there really is no one product that does it all, sadly.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen hair products for at least 8 years.</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past and then it was replaced with a pump styling cream which is not nearly as good</li>
            <li> I travel for work and the constant change in climate can do crazy things to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> After a while, my hair started to feel like thick, ratted straw.</li>
            <li> So it is expensive, even when compared to other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Adding this before brushing (in very small amounts) helps with tangles.  </li>
            <li> I also tried this product over several days with a different amount of product and it gave me a horrible result each time.  </li>
            <li> Ive used a lot of different hair products expensive and inexpensive and this by far is one of the worst.</li>
            <li> Wen is a very hard product to find</li>
            <li> it dry my scalp really bad...</li>
            <li> It is very thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks shiny and no fly aways...</li>
            <li> It is thin too.</li>
            <li> just as bad as the shampoo/ would like to try again but not willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> My hair still mushroomed and looked terrible, even felt a bit crackly, looked dry and dull with the color faded out.</li>
            <li> It is a WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really weird chemical smell (almost like it&#x27;s expired or something)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I watched the television ads.  </li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this smells awful.</li>
            <li> These products left my hair frizzy and just awful.</li>
            <li> , I hate a stiff style.  </li>
            <li> After using this, my hair was dry and looked horrible, I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to find it again.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dirty...  </li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> use their products as indicated and u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> and I have not been unhappy with their service!</li>
            <li> This product makes my scalp itch like crazy!  </li>
            <li> this styling crème has been a blessing for the crazy humid days!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Take Chaz’ lead and you will not be sorry!!</li>
            <li> , once I got the hang of cleansing, I HATE to admit it</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Try this you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my hair the way it was supposed to work on any ones hair very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> the result were horrible.</li>
            <li> My hair looked horrible when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Best anti-frizz hair product I have ever used. Lightweight enough so that it smooths your hair without making it greasy. I love the Sweet Almond scent, but it comes in other fragrances. One thing, I also use the WEN cleanser, so I do not know if this gel will work the same with other shampoos and/or conditioners.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of my styling creme and I HAD to order more.  I got a nice deal going through Amazon.  This stuff is great.  You use just a little bit and your hair can easily be finger combed.  It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> My hair was damage from perms and heat. I did research on the internet about Wen product I like the reviews that other users gave.  After one use my hair look better.</li>
            <li> I forgot to put this on my hair this morning, and when I dried my hair, it stood out 10 frizzy inches around my head. UGH! I re-wet it, put the styling crème in, and now it is soft, shiny, and beautiful. AHHHH. So I am hooked. I have very thick, very curly, very frizzy, color-treated hair, and I live in a humid climate (central Florida). I use about a quarter size amount. It is my miracle crème. And it smells amazing, if you like mint, which I do. Thank you, Wen!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is my advice.</li>
            <li> makes my hair less frizzy &amp; more manageable</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it will do; I like the smell, the feel and the way it makes my hair look.  I especially like that it does not weigh my hair down; so that if I do not wash my hair the next day it does not look oily and \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Like it and use it all the time</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My husband won&#x27;t use anything else. He just loves how it make his hair soft.  He likes the smell too.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however a dime size portion is more than enough for my hair.  Using as per instructions was too much product.  Of course my hair is thin and someone with long thick hair will need that much.  Dried light as a feather on my hair and left it still feeling very soft!  I like that my hair is very soft feeling so I&#x27;m happy this doesn&#x27;t take that away like most styling products do.&lt;br /&gt;Was surprised when my hair style held up so well with such light hold.  The curl did relax through the day but I like that, I hate a stiff style.  My hair moved like it does with no product!  It&#x27;s hard these days to find a light hold styling cream so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really sets you hair, and gives you more volume then you can imagine! Works well with the conditioner you comb through.</li>
            <li> Love all the Wen products - Wen saved my hair!!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice minty scent. Not sure it does much for frizz, but it makes my hair feel amazingly silky. It does not leave hair feeling weighed down or greasy - even on the second day of unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my wen, this worked great after my wen cleansing conditioner. I have really thick hair and this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love it hair feels soft like a child&#x27;s it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> wen is the best stuff ever....i have dry curly long hair....i have been usinng the fig cleansing conditioner for 2 yrs....i keep this product in the shower and apply it to dripping wet hair and let my hair air dry....it looks great!  use their products as indicated and u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Wish I could buy this in the store! This is such a nice product! It works well with my fine short hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s long hair; smoothed out her tangles and made it full of body. For my short hair it works well to style it without it feeling dry and laso gives it body as well! Love the fragrance which is suptle. It doesn&#x27;t take much for great results! Prefer this over many expensive brands! Reasonably priced for the quality and results!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  It made my hair hard and brittle, did not do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a re-order of a product I like a lot!  Will be ordering again when I use up this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but way too expensive. I will be cancelling my subscription. All products I have used, love the almond mint</li>
            <li> I have short, fairly fine hair and wanted something that would give me more volume.  The WEN Styling Creme definitely helps, it doesn&#x27;t take very much, follow directions just need to use a little from mid to tip of hair.  I will be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Item was very old and the sealed broken and leaking. I will not return it because it is not worth my time and money....Advise: buy it from the real source. I was going to try it first, but it turned out much more expensive.....Picture attached - in the box the creme and the spray...both damaged...and old...</li>
            <li> Best hair product by far!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It makes my hair look great whether I let it dry naturally or blow dry it!</li>
            <li> Iguess I better buy the shampoo first before I rate it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product and it smells wonderful.  It really helps keep my hair styled all day long.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about Wen products - my family works in the business, so I grew up with the best hair care products.  When I found Wen they topped them all.  Even better I can get the product on Amazon for less and it arrives fast! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their hair and have it look the best possible.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very shiny</li>
            <li> WEN will I learn to let good be good enough. I LOVE the Wen Conditioning Cleanser. In my quest for the perfect shiny hair, I bought this Styling Creme stuff, hoping it would put a sheen on the nicely conditioned hair that the Wen CC created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for the price, I thought at first. But, do not use a quarter sized amount! My hair is past my shoulders, dry as the Sahara (except for Wen&#x27;s Conditioning Cleaner which has made it soft and manageable)...and I only use a pea sized amount. (Just like the Wen Conditioning Cleanser, less is more for me. I use only 3 pumps of the Conditioning Cleanser.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, this styling creme is a waste of money. The first time I used it, it was like applying Vasoline to my hair. Yuck. I prefer to do what my friend from Chicago told me to do to prevent fly aways...spray humidifying hair spray on dry hair. Then blow dry immediately. It creates straight, shiny, silky hair. With Wen, this totally ridiculous process using hair spray works even better! My hair is soft without flyaway hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh me oh my....what we won&#x27;t do for for a good hair day. :)</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d this as a gift two Christmases in a row and I really like it&#x27;s light hold.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but it helps control frizz.</li>
            <li> Always use it.  Gave one away, so will need to order more.</li>
            <li> Met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the BEST leave in product  I have ever used.  It detangles instantly  and after the hair dries, it is so soft, so full of body. I will never use anything else, or be without this product. I am a 44 year  old african american,who has tried every product out there, trying to achieve what this product does for my hair. It has NEVER  looked this good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this styling creme and I really liked how it holds the style of my fine hair. It was delivered on the estimated time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> This is great for frizzy hair, it does not make hair greasy</li>
            <li> Im mixed. Black white and a little native American in there. Ive tried lots and lots cheap to expensive. .this is great. Hair looks shiny and no fly aways...only complaint is that its hard to wash out....</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I like it, good for styling, can make hair little oily possibly, don,t know yet</li>
            <li> I had some of this styling creme left over after trying the Wen Cleansing Conditioner (which I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with). However, I am absolutely impressed with this styling creme. I now use it with Bed Head shampoo &amp; conditioner. It must work well together because my hair is left feeling so soft &amp; shiny! I will definitely be ordering more of this once I run out of my little 2oz bottle I have now. Oh &amp; the best part is that you don&#x27;t need much at all. I have long thick hair &amp; I only use about a dime size of the creme. I highly recommend this product, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fantastic ! !!! Never disappointed in WEN ! Sweet Almond Styling creme is never greasy~ simply smooths away stray ends and prevents the damage of using heat to create style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new products for my damaged frizzy hair and am impressed with this one. I barely have to use any other products to make my hair smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> WEN products are excellent.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the styling creme.  It holds the curl in my hair all day without weighing it down.  My hair type is very fine and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a styling aid, along with wen cleansing conditioners. My hair was very easy to blow out- not sticky or gel like. Hair has great movement; not stiff or oily. Day two: hair still is looking awesome. Very impressed. I have used Goldwell products, which are very good, but i was intrigued by this new wave of shampoo-less products. It only makes sense- the ph of your hair will love you!</li>
            <li> I use this with my Wrap-Snap-&amp; Go styling wraps and it really helps keep my curls stay curly longer.  They stay very soft to the touch and smell nice.  Also works well to keep braids smooth and not fly-away.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  I don&#x27;t really see much difference if I use it or not but when I flat iron my ethnic naturally curly hair it does stay straight and not frizzy.  I would use it again because I use all the other Wen products which I love.  My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible. I decided to buy this product because I heard such wonderful things about it but there was nothing wonderful about this product. It left my hair super greasy and weighed it down a lot. I followed the instructions and the result were horrible. I have pretty thick hair and did not expect my hair to look so bad and it even felt brittle. Ive used a lot of different hair products expensive and inexpensive and this by far is one of the worst. I definitely would not buy this product again. It is a WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great!  I have curly unruly hair and this product came tame it.  It was a great find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed chick and use it to control my curl.</li>
            <li> great stuff I have med length hair that is colored so is on the dry side and it has a tendency to be frizzy with wen products keeps my hair in great condition and styling ncream just ads to the process</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a WEN girl.  I&#x27;ve been using the cleansing conditioner for several years now.  It&#x27;s a great product and does wonders for my hair.  I&#x27;m biracial and have ethnic hair that I wear natural.  It is very thick and curly.  In order to be able to comb through my hair I have to wet it.  I usually wash it every two to three days with the WEN cleansing conditioner then before combing it I apply about a quarter size dab of the styling creme.  At first I just used the cleansing conditioner, with my regular hair product--a creme gel which I used for frizz control.  It worked fine, but made my hair feel a bit &amp;#34;hard.&amp;#34;  So, when I found this product, I decided to give it a try.  The results were amazing!  It enhances the great results of the cleansing conditioner about a hundred times over; it adds moisture, shine, and a light hold to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel sticky or stiff.  I just wish it were a bit cheaper!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it wasn&#x27;t greasy or make my hair heavy. However I used the amount indicated and it took a little while longer than normal to dry my hair, which is annoying but it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme for well over a year and would not go back to regular shampoo for anything.  I get a lot of compliments on how beautiful and shiny my hair is and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does keep my hair from becoming frizzy. And unlike so many other products, this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. And a great product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky. Not really for hold, more for frizz control. I use this n my hair everyday. Love wen products. Best in wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have really think hair and before I started using it, it was so hard to comb my hair out. Now it&#x27;s not such a hassle!</li>
            <li> First off, this is not something I would normally have purchased, but my wife had tried various hair products from WEN and use to get the package order deal.  I like this styling Creme because it is not stiff like Hair Jell.  It is soft to the touch in my hair. Yes I would recommend this over other styling Gels</li>
            <li> Works great, especially with my short curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I know this wasn&#x27;t Chaz&#x27;s plan, but when I put this on my hair after showering I also use it on my face and neck.  After it dries it is a great foundation for the face powder that I use and keeps my old face smooth!</li>
            <li> It worked for my wife as her Stylist said it would!</li>
            <li> Wife likes product very much, I just buy it for her. This review process is really a waste of my time.  If we didn&#x27;t like the product we would not have bought so many times!</li>
            <li> just as bad as the shampoo/ would like to try again but not willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I stopped using WEN shampoo/conditioner after a few months as my hair became very dry. It is also winter so I will try it again in the summer as my hair seems to need different products each season. But I continue to use this styling cr&amp;egrave;me. It makes my frizzy, dry, wavy hair very soft.</li>
            <li> You only use a tiny bit of the anti frizz creme or your hair greases out. By using this tiny bit not only is your hair great but you save so much product. Out of the three scents I have used, I do think I like Lavender mint the best so far.</li>
            <li> Not pleased...left hair flat and oily.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair care product,  I used to buy from WEN direct.  But its easier to just order the product I want.  Not the entire kit</li>
            <li> Not too different than styling cream that is fig. It comes in better packaging from a tube and not a pump. Works as heat protectant, not so much at helping to style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the over the top &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; vibe of Chaz, but I have to tell you this stuff is great.  I use the conditioner cleaner as well.  What I like about this is it isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.  It has the right amount of weight and control.</li>
            <li> I am a Wen girl and I like this styling cream. I have naturally curly hair and my hair does not feel weighted down. I do use other products, so I cant speak for this on its own, but it is part of my hair routine and my hair is healthy, so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I tried it, it didn&#x27;t impress me so I think I&#x27;ll try something else. Oh well, live and learn.  Maybe it&#x27;s just MY hair &#x27;cuz others rave about this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite WEN product at an affordable price! Only place I found that you could purchase less than the full system.</li>
            <li> Love wen! My hair feels awesome, the gel last along time and it smells great.  Highly recommend all the wen products</li>
            <li> I really did not like thus product! My hair was very frizzy! My hair looked horrible when I used this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product at all. After using this, my hair was dry and looked horrible, I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product I ordered from Morning Beauty was delivered on time, was sealed but the Almond Mint did not smell like the original Wen product I usually use from Wen...The product looks the same and applies the same just does not have the same fragrance.</li>
            <li> This styling gel has just the right amount of hold for my short hair cut but not greasy like other gels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic!  Use as directed, sometimes if your hair is shorter I would use less than the recommended amount, but this stuff makes my hair silky!  There is a big difference if i don&#x27;t use it before drying my hair.  Makes my hair feel super healthy and super silky.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> wen sweet almond mint gives my straight hair lots of body and and it feels clean and soft  just lov this product  im a hairstlist</li>
            <li> I have been using Chaz Dean products for a year.  My hair is salt and pepper and the gray hairs tend to spring outward.  This is the first product line I have found (outside of salon styling) that tames those wild hairs and keeps them in place without feeling heavy.  The styling creme is an integral part of the that.  There have been times when my hair has gone 5 days without washing.  The products keep my hair nice looking and not stringy even after all that time.  I have recommended these products to friends and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> While I like the product, I question if I got a full bottle. There was no tab to pull off in order to get product out of container and it wasn&#x27;t full. Too much of a hassle to send back one item.</li>
            <li> This stuff smelled like horse poop. AND it&#x27;s got chemicals in the ingredients...and parfum. It did an okay job for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was healthier for my hair. Plus, the smell is hard to get over. It doesn&#x27;t smell like almonds. It&#x27;s a really weird chemical smell (almost like it&#x27;s expired or something) will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Best product for dry hair!  I gave dry curly hair  &amp; thus product tames and smooths whether I wear it curly or straight.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Tried to work w/ CHAZ on some of their products, but don&#x27;t like having to buy sets.  This is a great price too!  Will be back for more. HINT, I accidentally poked a hole just above the cap when trying to take off the wrapping and actually like that system.  Only need a little and the little hole delivers just enough.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product. Not sure if they changed the ingredients. My hair is still frizzy following the directions on the tube. Negative side- Your hair will actract dust and dirt. Leaves a film.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite some time now and love it. I have curly hair and it seems to help with the frizz. Has a great smell and good hold. Seems to wash out easily with no residue. Love Wen products!</li>
            <li> I have a large quantity of fine, limp hair that needs a styling product for boosting body and volume. While this styling creme smells great and really boosts shine, it made my hair flat and even more limp, which is not the look I want. This styling creme really is too heavy for fine hair, even when mixed with a root booster. It just did not work for me, which is a shame, because I really liked the shine this product imparted, and how great my hair smelled after using it. Back to Living Proof Full, which gives great body but does not boost shine. I guess there really is no one product that does it all, sadly.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped on time &amp; it did exactly what it advertised.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in putting some pizzazz on their hair.</li>
            <li> REALLY enjoy this product!  It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and leaves my naturally curly hair tame (aka no frizzy ends) and healthy looking.  Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t take much!  Just wish the price was lower so we could afford it all the time.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that this is my very first review ever. I never feel compelled to review products because I am never this pleased after a purchase but this product deserves its credit.  The thing is that there are just TOO many great things to say about these products! Yea I said it…products. I love it all not just the cleansing conditioner.  I am a 26 Yr. old African American female, with a fine grade of hair that is a little pass shoulder length.  Prior to using this product my hair has been flat, limp, and boring for about 4 or more yrs. now. I’ve used Paul Mitchell products and Aveda’s Brilliant and Rosemary Mint lines (which I happened to LOVE the Aveda Brilliant line) but that was before Wen came into my life. When I received my product I opened the box and I remember reading on the inside that over 90% of Wen’s users notice a difference in Volume, Body and Shine within 3 weeks of using Wen. Well, they should probably change it from 3 weeks to 3 minutes because I kid you not, after my very first wash I noticed a difference in Volume, Body, and Shine immediately. I was reintroduced to the hair that I knew, loved and missed so much.  It was so full, soft and cooperative it’s unbelievable. My mother noticed the difference right away and so did my coworker who asked me if I had added extensions to my hair. Not to mention my hair grew significantly and I don’t remember hearing about hair growth benefits during the infomercial for wen but the only thing that I changed was my hair product and suddenly my hair grows significantly in 2 weeks after one wash and using the Wen products in between.  I can only credit Wen for that. My favorite product besides the cleansing conditioner it’s self is the Sweet Almont Mint Styling Cream.  I absolutely love this stuff! Marvelous because, I applied some of the cream to one side of my hair just to validate that this stuff really works. I followed the directions and applied it from mid-shaft to my ends and before I could style it with the curling irons, and again the product worked IMMEDIATELY.  I noticed that the side with the Wen had way more body and volume than the side without. The other side looked flat and limp. That’s when I knew that I wasn’t overstating the effectiveness of Wen. It real and it works, it’s like a miracle because I have spent so much time and money trying to promote volume, body and shine for my hair and nothing worked. The products besides the Conditioner actually keeps your hair clean too. I am a little embarrassed to say this but I went 3 wks without washing my hair after my first wash with Wen.  Amazingly, my hair wasn’t dirty, greasy, and stringy or nothing like it would’ve been normally without a wash. Somehow my hair retained its shine, body, volume and cleanliness. I believe that all of the products cleanse’ your hair while extracting the natural oils from it. Again, I can only credit Wen because before the Wen I would have never been able to go 3 wks without a wash and still have cooperative, pretty, bouncy hair. My hair never stood a chance with that.  Even though one may have been washing their own hair for however long, it is important to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS as this will get you the BEST RESULTS! Take Chaz’ lead and you will not be sorry!! The BEST $30.00 I’ve spent (And no I am not employed by Wen lol, just a consumer happy with my purchase and felt it necessary to share this for those who have either doubts or interests)  I WILL NEVER USE SHAMPOO AND REGULAR CONDITIONER EVER AGAIN. THANK U WEN FOR BRINGING MY HAIR BACK TO LIFE!!! </li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. My hair is soft and manageable -  I have tried so many products and I can honestly say this is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and does help with the frizzies. I like all the wen products.Good value .Lasts along time.</li>
            <li> It is not my styling product of preference but it can do a fairly good job. The hair is a bite dull looking after using it. It does not add the light oil of a Moroccan oil. So, I prefer a combintation of Moroccan oil and Aveda&#x27;s Curl Creme for the ends before drying and styling my hair. Argon oil would be fine too.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy and it felt sticky all day.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how little I put on it felt very gunked up.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the shine. Warning....use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Adding this before brushing (in very small amounts) helps with tangles.  It also adds lift and makes your hair ultra soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep your hair beautiful! This is a great styling product and does not make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the entire line of WEN products , but especially the styling creme. It makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking - never weighs my hair down . So happy to find it for such a great price too !!</li>
            <li> So light, I was skeptical that it would work, but it does give volume to fine hair.  Short hair remains soft and holds its style.  Additional product, like Aerogel is needed for longer hair, to increase volume.</li>
            <li> I now only use conditioner when I rejuvenate my hair.  This is great for managing fly away frizz.  Will be back.</li>
            <li> too heavy. .wen gets too heavy for me, even with ll the coarse hair I have. I only use it now sometimes. this cream is also too heavy. get quidad. It works much better.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years my hair is thinning but this product works GREAT leaves my hair wonderfully easy to manage with more shine and body than before love,love,love!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this to keep your frizzy hairs from attempting to escape. It smells and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am frequently asked what I do to my hair for it to be so curly and manageable. This enables me to simply wet my hair, apply a little of the styling creme (more like a gel), scrunch my hair and let it air dry. It turns out beautifully.</li>
            <li> Yes!!! Finally a product that works miracles! I use to call my hair a beast. Because the curliness was out of control and some of the curls were flat. Like a disfigured S. I tried many products. from salon to store products. None worked, When I saw that Amazon carried Wen i immediately made an order. I bought the styling creme and the hair treatment. I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments. From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it. Recommend this product to people who have the disfigured S. Now my hair is spiraling and beautiful.  Hey the cost is pricy but come on! This is worth every Penny.!!!</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint Styling Crème by WEN works well on my very frizzy hair, I have found that I do need to use more than is recommended though, it smells delicious also. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love my WEN products and especially like this as my finishing treatment.  The price at Amazon is considerably cheaper than any other outlet I have found online.  As long as the price stays low, I will continue to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I find this works better when I use it mixed with the serum - I also find that I have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this,  keeps your hair in control and conditioned, not sticky or gooy</li>
            <li> I use this product along with there cleansing conditioner. I have color treated fine, curly hair. This helps with moisture and makes my hair feel soft and light. Does not weigh it down. Wish this would have been around 30 years ago!</li>
            <li> I prefer this bottle then the pump. Easier to dispense &amp; I use all of the product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but since reading about the lawsuit about hair falling out, I have stopped using these products.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a WEN kit directly from the website and recoeved this with the cleansing conditioner. THIS. STUFF. IS. AMAZING!!!!! It took away all of my frizz for the whole day (and I live in HUMID weather) and left my hair feeling soft and smooth and looking amazing. The smell is also heavenly, not at all like the conditioner, more like a cherry-ish mint smell. I would definetely recommend this, but buy it off pf wenhaircare.com, as you can get this and other amazing WEN products for $30.</li>
            <li> Great product by Wen!</li>
            <li> When I got the box it was actually bigger then exspected. It come out like the feeling of hair gel I thought it would make my hair make my hair sticky &amp; nasty, but it felt fine can&#x27;t even tell. Once I straighten my hair it was very soft, free moving, &amp; smelled good c:</li>
            <li> I will never use anything but chaz dean products on my hair again I went from frizzy hair to soft and silky and it smells so good</li>
            <li> BUT the problem is sellers. Not Amazon themselves. My product came with the exp scraped off and with ingredients different than the Chaz Dean website. I would advise not buying this product unless it comes from Wen, Chaz Dean or directly sold and shipped via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I gave the product 5 stars. Great product, leaves hair soft and wonderful. Even second day hair feels great. Scent is mild after blowdrying. My hair which has been dry lately with a little frizz was smooth and silky. I&#x27;ve used this product on an off for years now. It&#x27;s the price that keeps me from always buying. Though the product last a very long time my budget is tight. I should just buy extra when I can because I waste money on other products. My hair right now is mid back with layers. I split hair down the center and apply a pea size to each section. Starting at the middle and working to the ends. I never apply with in 6 inches of my roots. Guess I should give it a try. When I do I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like glue in your hair. I absolutely hated it! I wouldn&#x27;t waste a single penny on this stuff. What a gimmick!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using WEN products a few months.  The WEN sweet Almond Mint styling crème doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and goopy feeling like other products do but yet it gives it enough body that I don&#x27;t have to do a lot of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to it.  I have real short hair so after I blow it dry I put some of the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; stuff on it to shape it up and maybe a little hair spray and I&#x27;m done.  I really like WEN hair products for my hair.  It leaves my hair shiny and clean feeling and I can go several days without washing if I want to.</li>
            <li> great to give my hair that extra styling need</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and kinky which I presently wear straight with color. It was lacking in shine no matter what I did until WEN.  It really does deliver I love the smell and the results! My hair is totally manageable and has regained a healthy shine.  Thanks WEN</li>
            <li> This product is light and does double duty as a conditioning agent for your hair. My hair is fine and curly and I would not be without this product. It controls my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really support my curls.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen shampoo/conditioner and the styling crème for over 4 years.  I was ordering it from another company but had to order sets.  I was ecstatic when I found the individual products on Amazon.  They are quick to ship and I have not been unhappy with their service!</li>
            <li> Awesome product,  awesome and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby boys curls neat and doesn&#x27;t give him cradle cap like other products I was using. Then for me, it kept my hair soft after a blow dry</li>
            <li> This by far the BEST shampoo and conditioner that I have ever tried.  I was skeptical when I watched the television ads.  Amazon had such an incredible price that I decided to try it....WOW .  I have fine angel hair and Wen gave my hair incredible body and shine and to top it off my hair smells wonderful......highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> Super product for long or short hair --- hydrates well, and makes hair manageable and soft! I have VERY long hair and this makes it tangle-free too! (A very nice thing to have!!)</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of Wen Sweet Almond Mint Styling Creme and it has proven to be a great product. A little pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for. I recommend this product. I have course and thick hair and my hair has been more managable and the softness is a another plus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Works very well and makes my hair very soft. Adds moisture and keeps my curly, dry, frizzy hair from drying out. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Just amazing on my curls. I have thin, fine hair and this product make my curls just spring back to life and it makes my hair look fuller. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s pricey and the biggest size they carry is a 6oz. This stuff is gold, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Works well with Curls Rock and Morroccan Oil Luminous Hairspray. Really helps keep curls together and under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and a half and just put in a refill order. I have short, fine hair, but a lot of it. This product works great. I love how it feels in my hair - not greasy or sticky - my hair feels supple and has a lot more body and control than without product. I have found that the recommended amount on the WEN products is far in excess of what is needed for the results I want - which is good, because the product lasts longer for me. The package says to use a quarter-size dollop, but I find a dime or nickel amount does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product does what it says, calms my hair&#x27;s tendency to frizz/curl and is not heavy or greasy on my fine hair. love it</li>
            <li> this is great for your hair. I love the product.</li>
            <li> Just love it! Makes styling your hair so much easier and my hair is so dry and dead looking and this returned it to a normal looking head of hair! No easy task and worth every penny and can you put a price limit on a product that gives your style hold, body and smooths out dry areas? Just amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have used Wen hair products for at least 8 years. I love all of them, I had never gotten compliments as often as I do since using&lt;br /&gt;Wen. It leaves my hair soft shiny yet very manageable. Most importantly my hair looks and feels very healthy.  I can tell you that if you use Wen and you don&#x27;t have real long or real thick hair, only use about half of what the directions call for.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It is expensive but worth it.My hair is fine and frizzy and this really works.Working with amazon was a terrific experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hair stuff......cool.</li>
            <li> I love this WEN--this item was priced fairly and was shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes your hair so manageable.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this styling gel a lot.  It works well for my coarse gray hair and keeps it in place so I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> For the last several months, my wife has been switching over to WEN products. She&#x27;s been very happy with the results. So far, she hasn&#x27;t had a complaint about any of the WEN products she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> A frind reccomended Wen hair products,so I tried allof them.My hair looks fantastic,worth the money. People comment me on how shiny my hair looks</li>
            <li> Love this product it makes my hair so great ! I also use the ONE product from Sallys which is almost identical to WEN accept its $11 !!! But I do still use the WEN styling products they are  the best !!! And last forever ! I have very blonde hair that gets dry from swimming everyday...this product makes my hair look and  feel so healthy .No frizz or dried ends.</li>
            <li> I love this styling cream as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel icky.  I am very pleased that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;m a huge Wen hair care fan and I have coarse hair, so I thought this would be excellent... and it IS excellent, but found that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just ok on my fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair is thinning as I am senior citizen and it enables me to use the blow dryer and I have no damage to my hair it is the best!</li>
            <li> I like all of the Wen products but not for everyday use!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Unless I am, for some reason, looking for a product that leaves my hair as frizzy as when I use no product, I won&#x27;t use again. In AZ we basically have no humidity, so I&#x27;d be terrified to try this in a more humid climate. It smells great and feels lightweight, but my hair looked pathetic.    I have generally healthy, medium length, fine hair (and a lot of it). I use the cleansing conditioner and stick with my Matrix gel and mousse for styling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen hair care for over 3 years now.  I would never go back to regular over the counter products.  The whole line of products is wonderful for hair that is getting a little dry from over drying, chemicals, or just from age.  I highly recommend the whole line!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice.  It stops frizz without weighing my hair down too much but I have really thick coarse hair.  I don&#x27;t know if I would reccommend it for fine hair and I would never suggest using as much as the directions say.  They say a quarter size amount--maybe that&#x27;s for really long hair?  I have shoulder-length course wavy hair and I use only about a dimes amount and that seems more than enough.</li>
            <li> This styling cream works great. I like that it is a cream and not a jell. Find it clost to Redkin get groom product. But only one thing, if you use it everday, it makes your hair look flat. Great for the frizzes.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. I got a sample from my mother-in-law then turned my mother and friend on to it. They both love it to.I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to find it again. But of course my favorite web site Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair shinny and beautiful!! not heavy, mix it with some of the Wen cleansing conditioner and leave it in, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and easy to manage my curls love it will recommend this item to every one A+++++</li>
            <li> I like it, does not make my hair feel like gunk</li>
            <li> A great hair styling product. I bought this as a present for my wife.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for dry hair.  I use it on wet and dry hair.  It helps with the frizzies also.</li>
            <li> Really like the product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product, and now at a REALISTIC price. The Wen line has most people raving, but I would guess their pocketbooks are screaming.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the cleansing conditioners because I couldn&#x27;t resist the hype and the idea of simplifying my routine was also seductive.&lt;br /&gt;Well, once I got the hang of cleansing, I HATE to admit it but I liked the result. My fine hair, which was tangled no matter what shampoo I used, became significantly softer. Since I no longer needed to aggressively detangle, there was less breakage and damage, so my hair seemed to grow faster and stay healthier, despite coloring it. I have some gray which tends to &amp;#34;break through&amp;#34; early before I really want to re-color, and the cleansing conditioner seemed to delay that a bit. I can do the whole routine quickly now, and I use the  last bits (of the cleansing conditioner) on my hands as a shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is about the STYLING creme. Again, I hesitated to add on another product, but decided that the idea of a bit more heat protection and maybe more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t mess me up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is totally different from typical products, so please follow. At first I just applied a dime sized (quarter sized? No way for me) to my fine, chin length, towel dried hair. Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I actually did what they said: kept tube in shower, after cleansing, etc., applied less than a dime sized amount to dripping hair - mid shaft and ends. Combed thru and then wrapped in my microfiber hair towel (aggressively towel drying hair also damages it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: a bit more shine and body, and I feel a little less guilty when I use the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pay the $25+&#x27;dollars for this stuff, not  sure I would get it!  that is a lot of money. At this price, great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the TUBE is better than the pump because all of the pump products in the WEN line tend to have issues. That is, it&#x27;s a pain to get out the last quarter of the product (If it were just the last dollop, okay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if they would only have a better price on the cleansing conditioners, which work out to a MINIMUM of $1.50 a use. (Per WEN, 160 pumps in 16 oz. Bottle, need a minimum of 10 pumps per use and many people use more. At $30+ when you add in shipping, do that math!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am active and work out, so I feel the need to cleanse my hair/scalp at least every other day (daily in summer), as no product is going to stop the effects of sweat. (I also think the salt in perspiration does a number on your hair color).&lt;br /&gt; So it is expensive, even when compared to other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This STYLING creme is only costing me about 25 cents a time, maybe less, so I can live with that. (Call me cheap! pennies add up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I worth it? Well, I do like it and my hair is better. I get fewer cuts and go to a reasonable salon.&lt;br /&gt;Still, my common sense says that money could be going to better things (maybe the  victims of the latest disaster, who aren&#x27;t worried about their hair).  Obviously, someone is making a GIANT profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s the American way and I cannot deny it, but geez a little less greed would be good.</li>
            <li> 100 percent satisfied..... This is the end all be all for my hair. I have fine wavy hair that can easily turn to a frizzy, fluffy nightmare. This styling creme keeps my waves intact without any stiffness, leaves it soft and touchable..Other products have always been to heavy and weigh down my hair and it ends up flat and oily. Try this you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, however it is also just a good shampoo as this creme is just like many others. Compare prices of other styling crèmes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t expect much &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, not a gel.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  The price was a lot better than most places that was selling same product.</li>
            <li> Once I tried Wen products I was hooked. I just love how they make my hair feel. you might thing guys don&#x27;t care about that sort of thing but we do. My Favorite Cleansing conditioner (their version of shampoo) is Pumpkin Ginger. I brought enough to last the whole year (since it only comes out in the fall) but use the Almond Mint cream because they don&#x27;t have a pumpkin styling cream.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been wonderful for my fine, thin, and dry hair.  It is moisturizing and not heavy.  Plus, it is two products in one!  I have tried absolutely every shampoo out there, and this is the one I plan to always use!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My hair stays soft but if fuller with more body.</li>
            <li> I like the Wen Cleansing Conditioner very much, but the gel does not work for my hair. Initially it feels like a light weight gel, but then it&#x27;s almost like nothing was applied but water. After an hour - zero hold. So, I will continue to use the Wen Cleansing Conditioner because it works great, but I will stick to my regular gel.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and there were no issues with product quality.  I like the way this product glides on when applied and perfectly moisturizes my hair, requiring no further styling products.</li>
            <li> I have used wen for a couple years. I order from here because I have short hair so I do not have to use very much. I has enough product at one time to last a year.  I am down to almost nothing. The only product I don&#x27;t use is the balm. I think that must be for men who want their hair to stick up.  This styling creme is excellent  for me.  My hair has natural curl so it can get frizzy. It is thin too. This item makes my hair lightly curly and when you feel your hair it is so soft. Now I do put it on after I use the diffuser on my hair.  I love the way it looks and feels.  I don&#x27;t use the curling iron on my hair so much anymore. Just on my bangs to soften the curly look I do have to use very much since my hair is a short  almost to my shoulders length.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before, I love them smell, the fact that it is light and not heavy on your hair, great product!</li>
            <li> I really like the whole WEN line.  I don&#x27;t mind spending extra money if my curly hair looks nice.  I used a little more than a quarter size amount but only because my hair is thick an curly.  It makes your hair soft and less frizzy.  It dries nice and airy and pretty.  Thank you Chaz for the great products!  I use the whole sweet almond mint line.  My hair is much softer than it has ever been for curly hair. Shinier too!  I noticed too that after using the creme my hands weren&#x27;t greasy but soft.  Also the WEN conditioner when it gets on my shower door it comes off easily with water.  This tells me the conditioner rinses well and doesn&#x27;t leave build up.  Most of the other conditioners leave a lot of residue on the door that doesn&#x27;t wash off to easy.  I call it my shower door test for build up :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I am an African American female with thick, medium length hair. I have always gotten heat damage every time I straighten my hair and I usually have to straighten it again before the week is over. I applied this to wet hair before I dried and my hair was so smooth and full once I was done. I straightened it a week ago and I didn&#x27;t need to straighten it at all during that week. Although yesterday my hair got wet so I might straighten it again for the extra week. Plus the smell stayed in my hair for a long time and normally straightening balm usually wear off after I dry it. It smells great too. A little goes a long way too. I used a quarter sized amount per quadrant of hair. I also didn&#x27;t have any heat damage this time around!</li>
            <li> where to start... i know there is a lot of controversy over wen because for some it burns their scalp and makes their hair fall out. me too, but it does go away after a few uses. i have pretty long hair and i am always so reluctant to cut it no matter how crispy it gets so i am always looking for deep conditioners and hair masques to prolong the life of my hair until it&#x27;s next trim. i use wen products in the following order: two pumps of the cleansing conditioner, massage my scalp and run my finger from root to tip then rinse. two more pumps and i let it sit on my hair for about ten-fifteen minutes. every three or four days i will use the deep conditioner in the same scent as the cleansing conditioner. if i plan to put heat on my hair that day, i towel dry my hair until damp and then use the sweet almond mint styling cream pulling it from mid shaft to the tips and then continue to styling. wen products have halped my hair tragedy so much and i will continue to purchase them when i run out.</li>
            <li> I have over processed hair and this makes it so soft and adds shine to my hair.  I sometimes just use regular shampoo and style with this product and it does wonders!</li>
            <li> This product makes my scalp itch like crazy!  At the same time, it manages my hair very well - do others have this issue?  Has anyone found an unscented styling creme product that doesn&#x27;t cause this reaction or is unscented? I would appreciate knowing....</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for years and the styling creme is the only one I&#x27;ve continued with. They are great products for those seeking more natural alternatives</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for post perm fuzzies.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I am still looking for that perfect product. My hair is fine and one product has never been enough.</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations for Wen after seeing the info-mercial on TV. I am a middle-aged woman with curly, curly hair and I was hoping this product would give my hair less of a mind of its own. Now, maybe it is because I color treat my hair to cover the gray, and it would work better on hair with less chemical treatments. I can&#x27;t say it went above or beyond other products I have tried. It&#x27;s not bad, but, not what it purports either. At least not for me. I would have higher hopes for you if you do not color, perm or relax your hair. I still believe what it claims. I&#x27;m an optimist that way. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I will continue to use it as it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair. But it&#x27;s right up there with the other products which have failed to give me consistent and glowing results. Ah, well.</li>
            <li> Shiny and non damage hair</li>
            <li> I have used other WEN products and felt they were so so.  This is the best styling creme I have ever used.  It&#x27;s like it conditions and styles.</li>
            <li> I really love this product...  It controls the frizz from our humid weather fairly well and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dirty...  It still feels clean like I had just washed it and didn&#x27;t add any heavy product after...</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I liked this product but I did. I have coarse 3c hair and mostly wear my hair in wash and gos. This product is a great finisher because it adds shine and a little moisture to soften the gel. I don&#x27;t know whether I will keep this product in my rotation but it is definitely worth trying for those who are on the fence.</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean products are amazing. My hair has never looked and felt better !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, keeps my frizz in control!</li>
            <li> Really dislike to Wen shampoo, but love the styling gel. It&#x27;s very light on/in your hair. Kind of spendy, though...</li>
            <li> My hair has really &amp;#34;blossomed&amp;#34; using the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, it seems very much like the products I have picked up at the dollar store.  Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and this styling creme together.  I have fine and thinning hair and this helps it look thicker and gives it body too</li>
            <li> I have swapped from shampoo to Wen and hope to never have to go back!  This product really keeps the fritz down in a high humidity environment.</li>
            <li> this is a good product. I was pleasantly surprised how it made my hair feel.. Would consider future purchases. But frizzy hair in humidity is still an issue. I don&#x27;t think there will ever be a product that helps.</li>
            <li> This is the only product containing a silicone type of ingredient which I like.  It keeps my hair from frizzing without&lt;br /&gt;weighing it down as most products of this type do to my  curly, fine hair.  A big surprise and bonus for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first times used Wen and I just wanted to try it to see if it really worked and it does. Really like what it does to my hair I am really considering buying it in thier website and automatic shippment.</li>
            <li> I started using the WEN haircare system about six months ago, regrettably after my wedding.  For my wedding day, my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as I wanted or as smooth or pretty.  My hairdresser worked some magic to hide the short, brittle sections of my bangs that had literally broken off a few weeks before (probably from stress and poor diet habits for the months leading up to the big day).  My sister-in-law recommended WEN when she spotted my poor bangs and said she&#x27;d used some sample products a few months before and loved them.  I purchased the starter kit that came with this styling creme.  Within about three days, I noticed a significant difference in the quality of my hair; it was shinier, healthier, bouncier, and much more manageable.  Within two weeks, I noticed significant growth of the short, brittle section that was no longer brittle, but soft and much stronger.  Prior to using WEN, I was using about five different products on a daily basis to get my thick, frizzy, curly/wavy hair under control.  Now, I use the cleansing conditioner, this styling creme and a spritz or two of hairspray.  That&#x27;s it.  I will never go back to even the salon products I was using.  This beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li> WEN has the best ever styling creme I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this styling crime. It&#x27;s silky and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love wen! My hair looks great!!!</li>
            <li> Just ok. I don&#x27;t use these products anymore as I don&#x27;t like them as much as the Argan oil products from other companies. Would return if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Wren products. I just started using this and love it. I have found diluting it with a small amount of water helps as I have fine hair. It also makes the product last longer.</li>
            <li> I have curly, poofy/frizzy-prone hair, and this gel is a miracle.  It doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky; rather, it smooths my hair, and makes it soft and silky.  I even had to wear a ton on a humid day, and my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down or anything.  Instead, it was super shiny.  It also smells nice, and has a thick/creamy consistency that feels good to smooth over flyaway strands.  :)  Definitely going to buy again; and again, and again, and again...!  I&#x27;ve never found a gel that made my hair EASIER to brush out, and smoother rather than brittle.  So good!</li>
            <li> I use the styling cream along with the Chaz Dean cleansing and conditioner and makes my hair more manageable,</li>
            <li> Provides texture with no weight.</li>
            <li> all WEN product are excellent; have used this for 2 years and I cannot live without it</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this product.  I love natural products and this product has a weird smell.  The combination is off.  I also tried this product over several days with a different amount of product and it gave me a horrible result each time.  The first time I followed the instructions and used a large amount and it left my hair really weighed down.  It also left my hair unable to style once blow dried.  It made it straight as a board and I couldn&#x27;t curl it.  So I guess if you want your hair completely straight that would be helpful.  But regardless of that, I used less and less product each day to see if it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  But no matter how small of an amount I used, it weighed my hair down to the point of me not wanting to use it.  It made my hair greasy looking.  I really wished I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> unless you wanna get dandruff you can buy this product it dry my scalp really bad... i thought it was the original but is not so there follow your instincts.</li>
            <li> I love all Chaz Dean&#x27;s products, because they work on my thin fine hair. And my hair is soft &amp; not damaged.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use regularly and love.  When I found it on amazon I was surprised about the style of package.  I had never found this particular product in this package before.  Couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with it.  I am using it everyday right now and love and will order more.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love all the Wen products. I would purchase this product again in a minute.</li>
            <li> I like this product more than the other Zen Products; therefore, I order it separately. I purchased several tubes to last a while. It only takes a dab to put through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> The hair stylibg creme is not really working for fine sraight hair, it made my hair too soft , was not able to style  my hair as i normally do and was not getting any volume as was promised on commercial. Even using very little did not satisfy the outcome of my hairstyle&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for short, fine, straight hair, however , I could see it working very well for people with corse thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> I have used in the past and then it was replaced with a pump styling cream which is not nearly as good so I was very happy to find it once again.</li>
            <li> I love it. I love all of the Wen products. My hair has never been so soft. I am so glad I tried the Wen system.</li>
            <li> wen styling creme  I love it &amp; have highly recommended it to many that have ordered it &amp; love it also</li>
            <li> These squeeze bottles are so much better than the pump bottles. My husband can never get the last drop out of the pumps, but this bottle lets him squeeze out every last drop! My husband likes it because there is very little perfume to the product and does a great job styling his great hair!</li>
            <li> Tbe WEN styling creme is very kind to my hair. It is not too heavy, just right plus it protects your hair from drying out. All WEN products rock..except the price!</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this smells awful. I don&#x27;t know what is it about the styling cr&amp;egrave;me and spray, but they just stink, and this gel makes my hair look greasy at the top! Trust me, I am a die-hard WEN user (the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner, and the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment are the ONLY two product from WEN that I use in my hair, and neither of them stink/make my hair look greasy). If/when I can afford to use only those two products, I will. The only reason I use regular shampoos/conditioners/hair products is because I cannot afford to use only the two things I have listed above. This particular product (WEN Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me) is not my favourite, and I will not use this in my hair again.</li>
            <li> I have read and listened to all of the reviews on WEN. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt but was very disappointed. At first I thought that it might work. After a while, my hair started to feel like thick, ratted straw.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific styling cream!  I have short curly hair, and it puts shine and life into my curls.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else since I discovered WEN products, particularly this Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me!  A great buy, and superior styling tool!</li>
            <li> used a a conditioner and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixed hair. The only product that works. I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> I use the wen conditioner and LOVE it!  I travel for work and the constant change in climate can do crazy things to my hair.  this styling crème has been a blessing for the crazy humid days!</li>
            <li> After I went threw cancer 2011 I tried this product my hair just started coming in. The best product I ever used grew in heathy my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> Great styling gel....it brought back a lot of my natural curl and what a help.  Like the cleansing product as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need alot.  Not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your style or make it frizzy.  Feels graet and smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li> I like this product, just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I use all th wen products.  Even my hair dresser commented on how much better my hair feels since I have been using the shampoo and the stylign cream.  The price is much cheaper at Amazon and it is delivered much, much faster than if you order directly from WEN.</li>
            <li> Love the Wen products! Especially like using all as styling products. The cleansing conditioner is THE BEST leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my hair the way it was supposed to work on any ones hair very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped falling out. It is so soft too. I love this product  and would recommend it to all women!</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet.  This was given to my daughter and have not idea if she has used the product.  However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li> Love this gel for my hair.  Smells great and leaves hair styled all day long.  And it is not heavy like some others!</li>
            <li> smells delish! I&#x27;d need super size because my hair is so long and you need too many pumps of this.Great product but not cost effective for me.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream - have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wen Styling Cream for several years now.  This is one of the best styling creams I have used.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair less frizzy and natural looking. I have been using it for years and have never found any faults just yet.  It feels smooth and very easy to use for quick styles.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, I think WEN products are pretty good, however, they tend to leave your hair feeling heavy, this product seems to provide a nice protection after you have washed and conditioned your hair, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I like WEN products so this was a great way to buy what I need.</li>
            <li> I am so a Wen girl.  I love this stuff and what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Wen user and have been for approx. 4-years. The styling cream works great on my short hair. The texture of the styling cream is light, not greasy or sticky. Amazon&#x27;s price is more affordable than the retailer I&#x27;ve been purchasing from.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it everday . I don&#x27;t blow my hair just scrunch it and off I go.</li>
            <li> Hair was very frizzy after using this.</li>
            <li> I am a WEN girl now for life</li>
            <li> This stuff works great I love all of his products.</li>
            <li> The best for 4c hair.  really love his whole system,  I just can&#x27;t afford it regularly.  This stuff really help when you have ends that are hard to run your finger thru .  it only takes a little bit and I can finger comb my hair after.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> The curl wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and it was oily</li>
            <li> Wen Rocks! Been using it now for 3 months and my hair just keeps getting softer and shinier and prettier. I was having a problem with dryness before. I got pulled in by the infomercial - something I swore I&#x27;d never do. Never say never. But guess what? It really really worked! I was so excited I sent a starter kit to my granddaughter. Her hair is dark, super Thick and tends to get frizzy in the humidity in Texas. She is so happy that Nana (that would be me) found a solution for her frizzies, I&#x27;m the Hero! Thanks Wen. I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; writer but I&#x27;ll write one for you anytime!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes of relieving the frizzy state of my hair and fully trusted that it would work, given that I use and love the WEN Cleansing Conditioner. I live in Georgia which has been ungodly humid all summer, and recently got a nice new haircut which by the end of my workday would swell out from my head like a mushroom no matter what I put on it. When this styling creme arrived, I could hardly wait to use it. And I did, and nothing changed. My hair still mushroomed and looked terrible, even felt a bit crackly, looked dry and dull with the color faded out. UGH!!! I was so disappointed. I was sure it would work for me and disregarded the negative reviews here, thinking Oh, these ladies must not  have used it correctly. I&#x27;ll show them! It will work for me and....then it didn&#x27;t and I am eating crow right now. What a shame and what a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine but with the strange phenomenon of seeming thick and bushy in the humidity. I&#x27;ve colored it as well recently. I work outside (dog walker) and so have had the sun beating down on my hair all summer. Add to that overuse of a curling iron before I had a haircut/color, and my hair was fried. I know that&#x27;s my fault! My hairdresser made note of the damage on the sides and said to lay off for awhile, which I&#x27;ve done. So it could be that this is great stuff for healthy, thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I washed again with WEN and tried this: I put a little more than recommended of the cleansing conditioner in my hair after rinsing, left it in and combed through. Then I applied some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH and combed through. THEN 4 drops of argan oil, combed through again. I held my breath, blew my hair dry, styled it and it looked great. But the real test was getting out in the weather today. With heavy thunderstorms this morning through early afternoon I was dubious. But it worked!!! My hair held the style, only swelled a tiny bit and with a few spritzes of John Frieda Frizz Ease hairspray (cheap but good stuff) I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color revived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine. I have also heard great things about Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Invisible Hairdresser&#x27;s Oil [[ASIN:B008ORT4NU Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser&#x27;s Invisible Oil 3.4 oz]] for taming frizz, so when I run out of the R &amp; B I think I will try that and see how it compares!hairspray (cheap but good stuff) I had a good hair day in spite of the rain, my hair was soft and shiny and the color revived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say again that the WEN styling creme is no doubt good for hair that is already healthy but not for fine, sun and curling iron-damaged hair like mine.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair luxurious.</li>
            <li> ok so I have just joined the WEN Community and i ordered a lot of the cleansing conditioners LOVE THEM, so I figured I should continue on my WEN adventure and order the Styling Cream, yes Good decision, I love the control it gives me the shine and hold without the icky sticky stiff feel. Thank You Chaz !!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.....I even watched the official Wen video to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I like the feel of it!</li>
            <li> This is good, not sure if needed.  As they say, a little dab will do you.  I use after every shampoo.  next time, I will leave it off and see if there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair with a lot of body.  I can use a dime&#x27;s worth of this styling creme and its perfect for my hair. Usually I have to use 3 times that much for other similar products.  Also, it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this product. Made my hair have texture and held the curl for days from rollers. Arrived fast and great customer serrvice!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product, makes your hair feel so soft and less frizzy</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife. She feels its a great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Felt like it flattened my hair. Won&#x27;t try again. I like their mint shampoo. Works good not a fan of the sculpting cream either</li>
            <li> This hair product works beautifully and smells wonderful. The price was very good and it arrived quickly. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my hair from frizzing.  I love the shine and how I can manage my hair easier with less work.</li>
            <li> Has a good feeling to it, not to sticky, keeps the shape of the &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; so my hair can dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I may be the only person who hasn&#x27;t really seen much of the Wen infomercials.  I&#x27;ve heard great things though about Wen products and decided to add this styling creme to my usual hair care regimen; which is fairly simple. I just use an inexpensive 2 in 1 that you can get at any drugstore.  I also use a hair color enhancer for my natural brunette hair.  I do not currently color my hair and I do my own cuts.  However, I have always tried to find ways to manage my fine, limp hair that is prone to frizz and dryness.  I also have to wash it every single day or it gets incredibly oily and gross at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only solution to decent looking hair has been: wash, condition, mousse/styling creme, full blow dry and then a finishing gel or pomade and maybe a light hairspray to finish.  UGHHHhhh!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just adding Wen Styling Creme to my damp hair straight out of the shower, I have actually been able to skip the entire styling ritual and still have healthy, shiny, fully moisturized hair.  I wake up with no frizz...how wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it now for 1 week and could not be more pleased.  I have no cons to report at this time, but I will be sure to update this review as I work my way through my first tube.</li>
            <li> I got this in the trial size and loved it so much that I ordered the larger one. It keeps my hair soft but holds great</li>
            <li> I always use this item.  I just wanted to see if I could get the product without joining the monthly club direct from WEN.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Exactly as described and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would definitely order again. Love all Wen products. Makes hair shiny and frizz free.  Wish it had a little more fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will order again great for styling makes your hair feel healthy and manageable not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have funky hair and with the styling gel I have nice hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have tried so many different types of hair care products.  I have curly hair and I am mixed (half african american and half caucasian) so finding the right hair care has been a challenge my whole life.  The complements on my hair have been numerous.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Good item great price</li>
            <li> I do like this product. however for the price and the size of the tube, it was 2/3 of the way full ( I understand that 4oz. is 4oz.) however when I looked at the size of the tube compared to the amount that was actually in the tube I was shocked I paid the price I did for this unopened the sealed hair product.&lt;br /&gt; I have very thick naturally curly hair, so I do use more than a &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; for coverage in my hair. I have used this product on and off for 7 months now. I don&#x27;t use it every day because of the thickness of my hair I don&#x27;t wash it every day. Even on my second or third day with out a wash my hair is soft and still smells fresh. I  would order it again if I knew the product would be &amp;#34;true to size&amp;#34; for the price I would have to pay.</li>
            <li> So bummed that after all the positive &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down&amp;#34; reviews that this was a total flop for me. Because I have stick straight hair, I used the tiniest, tiniest pea sized amount and just on the ends of my hair the first time I used it. Then I styled as usual. However, after I was done my hair still looked sorta greasy and stringy. I&#x27;m sure this is a desired effect for frizzy or curly hair but for straight hair it didn&#x27;t help my situation.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and decided to try this product.  The smell is awesome and it works great.  I can already my hair has gotten softer. Just putting a couple of drops and leaving in my wet hair has been doing wonders for my hair.  I use this along with the Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Essential hair care treatment...</li>
            <li> Like this better than any styling lotion I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;used.</li>
            <li> new and sealed exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I suspect all things WEN are a scam. These products left my hair frizzy and just awful. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> made my hair too oily!</li>
            <li> this product seems like it doesn&#x27;t do much but it really does. You can use it more than once in the day without buildup.</li>
            <li> It is a great styling creme.  Helps prevent the hair from frizzing and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly coarse hair loves this styling crème.  Creates soft curls and helps tame frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and I wanted to try it again.  It is exactly like the previous product I had</li>
            <li> I would rather buy from Amazon than direct from Wen.  They are not easy or friendly to deal with and have totally messed up my account with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Hair Products, this one in particular, for quite some time now. Wen is a very hard product to find but I know I can always count on amazon to deliver at a very great price, with fast shipping and no problems. I will continue to use amazon for this product and I do recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found, my hair is frizzy and this product really gets it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN A WEN GIRL FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN I STARTED USING THE CLEANSER CONDITIONER.  WEN PRODUCTS PROTECT THE COLOR SO THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T WASH DOWN THE DRAIN.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT I USE THE STYLING CREME AND I USE IT IN ADDITION TO STYLING MOUSSE.  I HAVE THIN, FINE HAIR AND THE STYLING CREME MAKES IT EASY TO BLOW DRY MY HAIR WITHOUT ANY DRAG WITH THE BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR.  EVEN MY HAIR STYLIST NOTICED THAT MY HAIR IS IN THE BEST CONDITION SINCE I STARTED USING WEN PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with styling cremes, but this one is very manageable &amp; workable for me. I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in my hair when using this product.  Did not affect dry time, shine, or frizz.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed and glad I had an Amazon balance and didn&#x27;t pay for this with my own money....</li>
            <li> Was prepared for my hair to feel a little limp with this product, but that&#x27;s not what has happened. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft enough and styling hold isn&#x27;t what I would like. I have very fine hair and this is just not the product for me.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  Not as great as I thought it would be. Would not buy again.  The shampoo is pretty good.</li>
