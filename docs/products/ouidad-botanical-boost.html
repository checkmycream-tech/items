            <li>and I think it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably for someone with more curly hair vs. wavy.</li>

            <li>I have great healthy natural curls.</li>

            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something to help my fine hair have some type of style.  </li>
            <li>I am of Mediterranean descent, with fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My wavy, spirally hair is fairly fine.</li>
            <li>I think it was worth the money, it&#x27;s just isn&#x27;t as magical as you want it to be.</li>
            <li>I also have PlayCurl Volumizing Styling Gel Spray which is supposed to be a great second day refresher as well.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic to use after shampoo to give curls a curly but controlled look.  </li>
            <li>No sticky feeling, leaves hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than if I sprayed my hair with water, and I can do that for free.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this when I purchased the  3-product Ouidad Expert Curl Kit over a year ago when beginning to use the Ouidad product line.  </li>
            <li>spray refreshs my curls even after a full night sleep.  </li>
            <li>This works great for refreshing those curls after a long day or to keep style lasting just one more day</li>
            <li>ALso, it works great with Ouidad Botanical Boost Moisture Infusing and Refreshing Spray, the sparay refreshes your hair and keeps it from getting hard!</li>
            <li>If that happens to you when using this product, just seal it by applying a little Jojoba or Almond oil after misting with Botanical Boost and you&#x27;ll notice that you will have all of that great moisture</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, I have curly hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>I think the product works very well and am enjoying having curly hair where before it was not so much.  </li>
            <li>Far better than just water like another reviewer said.</li>
            <li>This is my best kept secret.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I am a mixed african american/caucasian woman, and my hair can be tricky at timees, but this product works, and i love it!!</li>
            <li>that when I wake up, it ain&#x27;t a pretty sight.</li>
            <li>Wish I could buy a whole box of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Thanks OuiDad!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser totally fried my hair, and I&#x27;m sure two c-sections didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing for my curls (I have blond, fine, but thick hair)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair amazingly curly--usually I have to use quite a bit of mousse and scrunching to get the defined curls and volume that this product provides, and it is also extremely conditioning.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it helps my fine straight limp hair.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because it does what it says it will do which is pretty unusual in the hair care market.</li>
            <li>Well, my hair pretty much looks like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Ouidad products and liked them, but this spray really does nothing at all, not even de-tangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it actually calms your scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I use on my fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that for my hair I need to apply an oil after using Botanical Boost to seal it and really lock in that moisture.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do all that much for me, in fact it did nothing, as if I put water on my hair.  </li>
            <li>really irritated my lungs and sent me running for my inhaler - I have asthma.  </li>
            <li>Been using this about a year now and really like it.</li>
            <li>It really does reactivate curls even after sleeping on them.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>If anything, my hair is unusually frizzy after using this product.</li>
            <li>This product makes it feel much silkier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what a few spritz of this will do in the morning!</li>
            <li>I have used store products that deliver better results for much less.</li>
            <li>Before I found this, I&#x27;d have to make sure that I woke up in enough time to take a shower so my hair could look like I belonged to the human race.</li>
            <li>Now natural products and high end products never bother me; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I wash with cowash, lightly pat my hair with towel, spray on this botanical spray and comb with wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li>I added to my normal hair routine</li>
            <li>Will continue to use with various products to find the right combination.</li>
            <li>I also have a biracial son whom I spray on his curls in the morning and the ones that straightened up during sleeping recoil and his hair becomes very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the special order since it&#x27;s hard to find in hair salons or stores.</li>
            <li>The combination of these three products manages to give me three days of soft and bouncing curls.</li>
            <li>&#x27;I feel Pretty&#x27; commercial where the babies have totally messed up hair when they wake up?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to mixed women who have a hard time dinding a product that will keep their hair looking nice instead of frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>i have very thick hair with more of a natural wave</li>
            <li>Left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>It really helps refresh and hold the curl in a loose, non-yucky or crunchy way.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick, curly, coarse, long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I didn&#x27;t color it, so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Ouidad products which have worked beautifully, but lately, the products I&#x27;ve been getting have been no better than water in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff but does calm the frizz while enhancing the curls.</li>
            <li>Made me sad because I love natural products!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what a few spritz of this will do in the morning!</li>
            <li> I have used store products that deliver better results for much less.</li>
            <li> Before I found this, I&#x27;d have to make sure that I woke up in enough time to take a shower so my hair could look like I belonged to the human race.</li>
            <li> Now natural products and high end products never bother me; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for anyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I wash with cowash, lightly pat my hair with towel, spray on this botanical spray and comb with wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> I added to my normal hair routine</li>
            <li> Will continue to use with various products to find the right combination.</li>
            <li> I also have a biracial son whom I spray on his curls in the morning and the ones that straightened up during sleeping recoil and his hair becomes very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the special order since it&#x27;s hard to find in hair salons or stores.</li>
            <li> The combination of these three products manages to give me three days of soft and bouncing curls.</li>
            <li> &#x27;I feel Pretty&#x27; commercial where the babies have totally messed up hair when they wake up?</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to mixed women who have a hard time dinding a product that will keep their hair looking nice instead of frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair with more of a natural wave</li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> It really helps refresh and hold the curl in a loose, non-yucky or crunchy way.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick, curly, coarse, long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I didn&#x27;t color it, so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Ouidad products which have worked beautifully, but lately, the products I&#x27;ve been getting have been no better than water in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff but does calm the frizz while enhancing the curls.</li>
            <li> Made me sad because I love natural products!</li>
            <li> It smoothes frizz without weighing down &amp; it smells so natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been coloring my hair a dark brown for the last three years while I had babies, and after my daughter was born decided I wanted lots of blonde again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and both times on wet hair, so we&#x27;ll see how it does tomorrow on day two hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to tame the frizzy side hairs near my temples and ears that stick out when I wear my hair up.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t going to send it back, but now that it makes me ill to use it, I am sending it</li>
            <li> After it air dries and I fluff with fingers</li>
            <li> This price was cheaper than other online</li>
            <li> it works sometime and other times it just adds water to my hair</li>
            <li> My hair actually felt drier than usual.  </li>
            <li> and it did allow for my curly waves to do what they do, without weighing them down or allowing frizz.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on the surface and then tip my head upside down to spray the underside</li>
            <li> Made my fine curly/wavy 2b hair look dirty, dull and weighed down.</li>
            <li> but if I could find something else that works just as well for less money, I&#x27;d switch.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t seal after using the Botanical Boost, my hair tends to look dry which makes it appear dull even though it is moist to touch but is lacking that moisturizing sheen I adore.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky coming out of the bottle but that goes away&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says to use a little - no, you have to use a lot to get rid of the frizzies&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I seal with a little Jojoba oil or either Ouidad&#x27;s Climate Control Frizz and Flyaway Fighter).  </li>
            <li> It dried out my hair instead of moisturizing it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair remains frizzy and limp even with the spray.  </li>
            <li> A few spritzes of this spray and scrunch the hair, and it looks like I just washed and defuse-dried it.  </li>
            <li> No more frizz, no more having to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair from scratch every day.</li>
            <li> but I have to work hard to get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> When my curly, thin hair strands go limp after sleeping on them I reboost them with Botanical Boost.  </li>
            <li> This product never lets me down!!!</li>
            <li> I also carry a small one in my purse!  </li>
            <li> However, the pump is difficult to use, hard to push down.  </li>
            <li> VERY expensive for only 8</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I use this along with twisted sista.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t do what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> (I just hate the smell of it).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been looking for this in stores and can&#x27;t find it.  This price was cheaper than other online stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray refreshs my curls even after a full night sleep.  Light but effective.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with frizzy hair on one side of my head - the side that I slept on, I&#x27;ve tried the satin pillow that others have suggested but my head keeps sliding off the pillow. I decided to try this after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - refreshes my curls and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It is a little sticky coming out of the bottle but that goes away&lt;br /&gt;  It says to use a little - no, you have to use a lot to get rid of the frizzies&lt;br /&gt;  VERY expensive for only 8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it does what it says it will do which is pretty unusual in the hair care market. I will keep using it because my hair does look great but if I could find something else that works just as well for less money, I&#x27;d switch.</li>
            <li> The way I use it is to help refresh my day two curls and take any frizz out of my crown from sleeping. For that it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it over my staple products which are Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner and the Ouidad Climate Control® Heat &amp; Humidity Gel. The combination of these three products manages to give me three days of soft and bouncing curls. Which is something I&#x27;ve never had before in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting a star because it is a bit pricy. I believe a tad more than it need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product as a curl refresher spray. It does the trick for my picky curls!</li>
            <li> I use Botanical Boost on my 2c/3a hair every morning whether I&#x27;m going curly or wearing a wavy roller-set style.  I originally got this when I purchased the  3-product Ouidad Expert Curl Kit over a year ago when beginning to use the Ouidad product line.  It has rice proteins and aloe in it which is great for keeping moisture in your hair. Smells good too!  I&#x27;ve learned that for my hair I need to apply an oil after using Botanical Boost to seal it and really lock in that moisture.  Once I&#x27;ve sealed it, the Botanical Boost locks in moisture and keeps my curls nice and fresh (I seal with a little Jojoba oil or either Ouidad&#x27;s Climate Control Frizz and Flyaway Fighter).  If I don&#x27;t seal after using the Botanical Boost, my hair tends to look dry which makes it appear dull even though it is moist to touch but is lacking that moisturizing sheen I adore. If that happens to you when using this product, just seal it by applying a little Jojoba or Almond oil after misting with Botanical Boost and you&#x27;ll notice that you will have all of that great moisture you were seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract, Methyl Gluceth-10, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Benzophenone-4, Benzalkonium Chloride, Fragrance, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever owned! It smoothes frizz without weighing down &amp; it smells so natural.</li>
            <li> I think the product works very well and am enjoying having curly hair where before it was not so much.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this spray, it moisturizes hair and refreshes curls. No sticky feeling, leaves hair soft and smelling good. Can&#x27;t be without it. Great product! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this on my curly haired daughter. It does a good job of refreshing her curls. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I used to spray on water to revive my curls.  This works better and I love it!  Have recommended it and will keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> Works like it says... Refreshes curls while conditioning. I added to my normal hair routine and it did allow for my curly waves to do what they do, without weighing them down or allowing frizz. Will continue to use with various products to find the right combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  I switched from It&#x27;s a 10 and I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I think it was worth the money, it&#x27;s just isn&#x27;t as magical as you want it to be.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Ouidad! Calms his flyaway hair without leaving sticky residue or film. Well worth the special order since it&#x27;s hard to find in hair salons or stores.</li>
            <li> For my curly hair this ouidad product is my daily staple. Just LOVE it!! Highly recommend it for anyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair instead of moisturizing it</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, I have curly hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> i read lots of reviews on this product and many people said it worked so well in their hair. i have very thick hair with more of a natural wave and this didn&#x27;t fully give me nicer curls. it works sometime and other times it just adds water to my hair i think.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It&#x27;s the only product I use on my fine frizzy hair. Helped restore my curl pattern after I ruined it by over-styling. I wash with cowash, lightly pat my hair with towel, spray on this botanical spray and comb with wide toothed comb. After it air dries and I fluff with fingers I have great healthy natural curls. No residue or greasy build up!</li>
            <li> I have type 3a curly hair and I purchased this item after having read the reviews.  It really didn&#x27;t do all that much for me, in fact it did nothing, as if I put water on my hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this product is necessary for me.  Spritzing with water to refresh my hair seems to be equivalent to what this product does.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something to help my fine hair have some type of style.  I love this product, it helps my fine straight limp hair. It defines curls, adds shine and makes my hair bouncy.  I hope that they do not change this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best for what I need, I have very fine hair which curls when I use this product.</li>
            <li> This works great for refreshing those curls after a long day or to keep style lasting just one more day</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick, curly, coarse, long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I didn&#x27;t color it, so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning.  The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than if I sprayed my hair with water, and I can do that for free.  So, I decided to spray a lot of it, and the baby powder smell (some chemical?) really irritated my lungs and sent me running for my inhaler - I have asthma.  Now natural products and high end products never bother me; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction.  At first I wasn&#x27;t going to send it back, but now that it makes me ill to use it, I am sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumb question:  Why do some of my orders have a button where I can provide a review, and some don&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> This product got so many good reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will help with keeping the curl and eliminating frizz.  This one isn&#x27;t it.  My hair actually felt drier than usual.  Water works better at sprucing up and refreshing my curls.</li>
            <li> Have you ever saw the Pamper&#x27;s &#x27;I feel Pretty&#x27; commercial where the babies have totally messed up hair when they wake up? Well, my hair pretty much looks like that when I wake up, it ain&#x27;t a pretty sight. Before I found this, I&#x27;d have to make sure that I woke up in enough time to take a shower so my hair could look like I belonged to the human race. It&#x27;s amazing what a few spritz of this will do in the morning! It&#x27;s also a great curl refresher if you&#x27;re heading out after work and your hair needs a pick-me-up. Before I discovered this, if I was trying to revive my curl, it would be with water and I would wind up pulling my hair back into a ponytail and hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t get too frizzy. I also have PlayCurl Volumizing Styling Gel Spray which is supposed to be a great second day refresher as well. Haven&#x27;t tried it that way though because I&#x27;m pleased with the results of Botanical Boost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it as a detangler after washing my hair when I don&#x27;t use a conditioner, however; I find that Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Moisture Kick Spray Conditioner does a better job (I just hate the smell of it).</li>
            <li> When my curly, thin hair strands go limp after sleeping on them I reboost them with Botanical Boost.  It&#x27;s just ok, tho.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again as I still think there is a better revitalizer for those curls out there.</li>
            <li> Love it! Boosts my curls!</li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft.  I wish I could find a product that gave my hair more body without my hair becoming &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wish I could buy a whole box of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I play tennis several times a week and don&#x27;t want to wash my hair that often.  This is a great help to make me feel like I look more presentable in between shampooing.</li>
            <li> I read about this in Prevention magazine that it was great for post workout for sprucing up curly hair.  I did better with some Garnier stuff from Walmart.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Been using this about a year now and really like it. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff but does calm the frizz while enhancing the curls. Won&#x27;t be without it any more. Far better than just water like another reviewer said. Not a gel or hair spray type. Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing your curls and nurturing your scalp. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it actually calms your scalp.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great to refresh and restyle your air with your fingers, brush, comb or whatever you prefer. It&#x27;s not at all sticky and smells nice.</li>
            <li> So playful, So curly...so playfully curly!!!</li>
            <li> My hair remains frizzy and limp even with the spray.  I&#x27;ve used other Ouidad products which have worked beautifully, but lately, the products I&#x27;ve been getting have been no better than water in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Made my fine curly/wavy 2b hair look dirty, dull and weighed down. Very expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t do what is supposed to do. Made me sad because I love natural products!</li>
            <li> I use this along with twisted sista.  Great to use if you want to refresh and define your curls.  I think it will work for any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the way this product refreshes my curls.  However, the pump is difficult to use, hard to push down.  It&#x27;s almost like one needs to use both hands -- but that doesn&#x27;t work so well when trying to spray one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really does reactivate curls even after sleeping on them.  It does not have a great smell and have to use a smoothing serum to mask it.  But it is so worth it!!! highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use this on the mornings that  I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. Just spray it on the surface and then tip my head upside down to spray the underside (I have a lot of hair) and the curls spring back to life. I also have a biracial son whom I spray on his curls in the morning and the ones that straightened up during sleeping recoil and his hair becomes very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for fantastic, amazing, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy curls.  I have Kinky/Curly hair....and this transforms my hair.  This is my best kept secret.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for years and absolutely love it!  It works like nothing else and I&#x27;m grateful for the opportunity to purchase it here.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for curly locks!  It turns Bed Head into Best Head of curly hair.  It is fantastic to use after shampoo to give curls a curly but controlled look.  I use it daily!  This product never lets me down!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, came shrinkwrapped so nothing came spilling out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Ouidad has changed my life. Seriously. No more frizz, no more having to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair from scratch every day. For the first time in xxx years, I embrace my curls and am glad to have them! The Botanical Boost is something I use every day. It really helps refresh and hold the curl in a loose, non-yucky or crunchy way. This was my fourth bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the best refresher for natural curls.  I am of Mediterranean descent, with fine curly hair.  A few spritzes of this spray and scrunch the hair, and it looks like I just washed and defuse-dried it.  And the bottle lasts forever.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> use it between washes and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great</li>
            <li> Love all Ouidad products</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results.  I have used store products that deliver better results for much less.</li>
            <li> My wavy, spirally hair is fairly fine. I&#x27;ve used other Ouidad products and liked them, but this spray really does nothing at all, not even de-tangle my hair.  If anything, my hair is unusually frizzy after using this product.</li>
            <li> Just love this botanical spray.  You can fix your curls and bring them back to life in a moment.  I also carry a small one in my purse!  Thanks OuiDad!</li>
            <li> I love this product and when used as directed and consistently it makes my hair beautiful. The friz in my curls is nonexsistent.</li>
            <li> Great product for curls.</li>
            <li> I am a mixed african american/caucasian woman, and my hair can be tricky at timees, but this product works, and i love it!! I can put it in my hair, and leave my hair just the way it is for days if i want to. I would highly recommend this product to mixed women who have a hard time dinding a product that will keep their hair looking nice instead of frizzy and dry. ALso, it works great with Ouidad Botanical Boost Moisture Infusing and Refreshing Spray, the sparay refreshes your hair and keeps it from getting hard!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Is not sticky and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is good to use on days you don&#x27;t wash your hair.  My hair is really coarse and curly and it is the perfect solution for the days that you don&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering and I think it&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s probably for someone with more curly hair vs. wavy.</li>
            <li> I love this spray gel Its good stuff to use I like it a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to tame the frizzy side hairs near my temples and ears that stick out when I wear my hair up.  It doesn&#x27;t do the job that I needed it to do. The fragrance is okay but not as fresh as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> She loves loves this product and was on top of her wishlisht. Reccomended for all curly hair types. Works great</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that the dog groomers in Washington use something similar, but I do NOT like the odor. It reminds me of lots of sprays we used to get for our mini-Aussie. The product is amazing for my curls (I have blond, fine, but thick hair) but I have to work hard to get past the smell.  It makes my hair amazingly curly--usually I have to use quite a bit of mousse and scrunching to get the defined curls and volume that this product provides, and it is also extremely conditioning. I&#x27;d been coloring my hair a dark brown for the last three years while I had babies, and after my daughter was born decided I wanted lots of blonde again. My hairdresser totally fried my hair, and I&#x27;m sure two c-sections didn&#x27;t help. So it was like straw. This product makes it feel much silkier. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and both times on wet hair, so we&#x27;ll see how it does tomorrow on day two hair.</li>
