            <li>timely delivery- thanks!</li>
            <li>It seems the market for powder is not really happening, and even Shower to Shower including this my favorite smelling Breeze Fresh with Vanilla Essence, is being discontinued for some reason.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, and the powder itself is somehow &#x27;silkier&#x27; and smoother than some of the other talcum powders I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>Right away I placed another order for the Original Scent in the pink bottle.</li>
            <li>When i found out it was discontinued, I located some here on Amazon &amp; bought as many as they would allow...still not enough to last me a looooong time!  </li>
            <li>I feel fresh all the way to the end of the day, and isn&#x27;t &#x27;gritty&#x27; at all, like another powder I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>If you shop Amazon a lot, Amazon Prime is very much worth the cost each year, especially around Christmas time!</li>
            <li>I love the long lasting fragrance and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live.</li>
            <li>I can only hope that when my four bottles are used up in 3 or 4 years that I will be able to get some more or something equal, which right now seems doubtful.</li>
            <li>Cost a little more but in this case I did not mind since I ordered enough to last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Again, too bad it isn&#x27;t readily available in stores, but hopefully it will continue to be available via Amazon.</li>

            <li> The body powder is a light vanilla scent that compliments both of the vanilla fragrances I use (one is Avon; one is Bath &amp; Body Works).  It also works well for absorbency; I&#x27;ve used it all year round and had no chafing while using the product.  I&#x27;m glad I found it here; no stores carry it anymore in my area.</li>
            <li> My favorite body powder ....sadly no longer available. I grabbed what I could on Amazon and hope it outlasts me.</li>
            <li> love this powder-haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores since i first purchased it - so glad to find it online, really needed it for hot summer days and cool showers</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it every day and love the scent.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally so was very happy that Amazon had it.  But that makes me nervous too.  I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...been using it for many years...my grandma used it &amp; I got started</li>
            <li> When we were unable to purchase the vanilla scented powder in the stores, we checked on-line and sure enough we found it.  Now,  we just buy it by the dozens and just reorder it when necessary.  Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the powder itself is somehow &#x27;silkier&#x27; and smoother than some of the other talcum powders I&#x27;ve been using.  I feel fresh all the way to the end of the day, and isn&#x27;t &#x27;gritty&#x27; at all, like another powder I&#x27;ve been using.

I&#x27;m going to be buying more, just so I don&#x27;t run out anytime in the next few years! ;)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon because fewer and fewer stores are carrying it! The ones that still do, bump up the price quite a bit so I am a happy customer. I accidentally ordered the Breeze Fresh with Vanilla Essence, which is not my favorite scent. But we kept it because my husband said he would use it! Right away I placed another order for the Original Scent in the pink bottle. It is a great price and with Amazon Prime...no shipping for me! If you shop Amazon a lot, Amazon Prime is very much worth the cost each year, especially around Christmas time! Many items I see in catalogs are available on Amazon. I mark them and then check Amazon. A great way to shop![[ASIN:B001E96PLO Shower to Shower Absorbent Body Powder, Original Fresh with Chamomile, 13-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I love this powder!  no grit in it, go&#x27;s on smooth and smells great too</li>
            <li> I love the very subtle scent of this powder! I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live. It&#x27;s a bargain online. It works great!</li>
            <li> Wish they still carried this scent at Wal-Mart...or anywhere else in Iowa!  It&#x27;s the only scent I liked in the Shower to Shower body powder brand.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling of the currently available powders, which are few in number.  It seems to me that Gold Bond has ruined the concept and I would bet that many would agree.  Some of the others are ok, while others are mildly offensive or objectionable.

            <li> It seems like the only place I can buy this scent of body powder anymore is at Amazon.  Great product and timely delivery- thanks!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite Shower to Shower powder scent.  Again, too bad it isn&#x27;t readily available in stores, but hopefully it will continue to be available via Amazon.</li>

            <li> I love the long lasting fragrance and so does my husband. (Men love vanilla) It feels good on the skin and it&#x27;s absorbent properties are beneficial to me.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent in a fine, reliable product.  I am delighted to have found it.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this scent in stores. Actually, finding ANY body powder is becoming difficult. I like this scent because it&#x27;s subtle and not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or floral. It&#x27;s non-irritating and does absorb moisture. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Good feel ... but I&amp;#34;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t really smell  VANILLA. :(</li>
            <li> Happy to find this product.  Good price and quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again!</li>
