            <li>Why not leave a good thing</li>
            <li>My hairs feels so nice because a touch of the oil does stay in, which tames my fly aways and frizz.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t deliver good results.</li>

            <li>and most people dont have that kind of time.</li>
            <li>The smell was never a problem for me, it&#x27;s true the smell is kind of strong smell, but really the smell goes away when you wash your hair, what I would do with a good smelling product without good results!!!</li>
            <li>Oh how I loved the original.  </li>
            <li>It feels healthy, soft and the ends feel GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this after reading so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF...........</li>
            <li>I recently got highlights in my hair and you know bleach is not the best for hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love my Ojon Damage Reverse Restoratiive Hair Treatment</li>
            <li>/&gt;In lieu of the wonderful results that I mentioned above, i must add that this is not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>sure if i will buy it again though</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>It has changed, but for the better I think.</li>
            <li>If you keep using it, your hair will just get better and better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I paid more than this Amazon seller is asking.  </li>
            <li>pointed me in the direction of Ojon and told me they were her favorite hair products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment since 2007 and love what a difference it has made on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair was beautiful and silky soft after two uses.</li>
            <li>I constantly catch myself petting my own hair, LOL</li>
            <li>It was the best money I ever spent on a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of the original.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product because so many people swore by it and the woman in the beauty store said this product sold out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I found it fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Rub between your hands very quickly until it turns into an oil, then apply.</li>
            <li>but when I got married, my husband couldn&#x27;t stand the smell full strength, although he loved the smell of my hair after washing it</li>
            <li>I tried the new lighter scent and love, love it!  </li>
            <li>but it is NOT designed for fine</li>
            <li>The addition of heat produced a huge difference in results.</li>
            <li>But this product greatly improved the overall look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels the more times I use it, and it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth too.</li>
            <li>Also, this is great as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it as good as the old formula.</li>
            <li>so it spreads super easily.</li>
            <li>The original has been reformulated.  </li>
            <li>I still like the original</li>
            <li>I was soooo excited to try this treatment after reading all of the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>It makes my damaged, bleached, color treated hair so soft and manageable and not to mention shiny like healthy hair should be!</li>
            <li>Yes it may melt&lt;br /&gt;easy, but it is a special product, if one would want something that did not have a non familular smell and won&#x27;t melt, then they should buy something</li>
            <li>But, when I wet and style my hair in the morning with the blowdryer, my hair turns out great.</li>
            <li>but it is not a bad product!Not</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and this product gives my hair a light grease for moisture when I add heat to it without being too oily and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super damaged hair</li>
            <li>Feel lucky if it is.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is rather strong though (natural but strong).  </li>
            <li>the good smell isn&#x27;t everything, especially with products for the hair and the skin, I really want on first place good results and second or third place the good smell.</li>
            <li>I guess I will try the new, but I so wish, if so many people are offended, you would  make it a choice.  </li>
            <li>must get this product, good for dry scalp and hair helps it grow.</li>
            <li>I love how it renews my dry hair,,,, love the conditioners.  </li>
            <li>The results and smell were well worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely be happier with something easier to use, but I&amp;#34;m happy that my texture is more improved than with other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The seller insisted that it was an updated product, but it did not work like the original formulation if that was really the case.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is the most amazing hair treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After one use, it left her hair silky smooth, moisturized, and strong as rope.</li>
            <li>but I ordered a wonderful little wooden comb from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair is baby soft, strong, and</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Love it, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Burnt hot wings.</li>
            <li>Not \\&quot;shine\\&quot;, but \\&quot;luster\\&quot;...;) Some of my curls have returned, defined and frizz-free - an unintended result.  </li>
            <li>However, this last time my hair ended up looking fried and tangled, and I was terrified that i&#x27;d have to cut a bunch more off than I had just done.</li>
            <li>I used it religiously once a week for months and my hair never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It worked on my hair exactly as it says it will, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much better now that I have gone back to Ojon.</li>
            <li>but my hair had never been so smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the smell and the price :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Slop it on heavily, leave on for a good twenty minutes then rinse</li>
            <li>Does anyone really think Fresh Spring  is a scent they can identify or that the Fresh Spring in New Mexico smells like the Fresh Spring in Indiana?  </li>
            <li>I used it on by daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it made it much softer right away.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, course, wavy hair, which means incredibly frizzy if left to it&#x27;s own devices and nothing else works like</li>
            <li>I first tried this years ago but did not like the smell even though it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the Restorative Hair Treatment I put way too much in and just did it for 20 minutes with a shower cap over my hair and applied heat from my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I even use the Restorative hair treatment on my face at night and it has changed my  dry skin in a most positive way.  </li>
            <li>I put it on, blow dry my hair for five minutes, leave it on for 15 more minutes and then wash and condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I had to use quite a bit from this large bottle</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good at conditioning but it seriously smells like wings from Dallas BBQ.</li>
            <li>but with a little bit of perfume in it, like the company is trying to disguise the strong smoky smell adding some of other good scent in it.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>THIS is the real formulation.</li>
            <li>I youtubed this product and someone suggested rotating this product with the moroccan oil intense hydrating mask, so i took a chance buying it.</li>
            <li>Also, this is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>My hair felt sticky and greasy even after a straight week of washing twice a day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s price, but a trip to the salon costs much, much  more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>After I washed my hair the second time, my severely damaged hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but I had just put too much in.  </li>
            <li>I went straight home and used it.</li>
            <li>This product works great but the smell is not great.</li>
            <li>And this was the one thing I came across while looking for hair conditioners or oils that would really help.</li>
            <li>I mean still a good product</li>
            <li>Brand new, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Let me tell ya, this product does so much more than any other oil product I have used.</li>
            <li>Country Vanilla, or Clean Cotton, or Spring Breeze, Fresh Spring and so on endlessly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>My fine, naturally curly, highlighted, blonde hair was so damaged by chlorine that my daughter even told me maybe I needed to just wear a wig.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly,there was significantly less breakage.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that has dry hair, dry scalp or just needs a great deep conditioner to replenish their hair every now and again.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a decent box, no damage.</li>
            <li>saw a slight difference in my hair but nothing amazing or major.</li>
            <li>I heard this was a miracle product, so I went in with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use argon oil too and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because it is supposed to help dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago I got my hairdresser buying this product because she couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair is after all the bleach.</li>
            <li>This was not the same product that I used and loved in the past.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit intense at first and it must be left in your hair for 20 minutes minimum.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get the newer version that is light in color with a less intense smell.</li>
            <li>It made my hair (finally tinted the right hue)</li>
            <li>I did not notice a significant difference in my hair, which is what I expected given the price of a product that I&#x27;ve never even heard of.</li>
            <li>scalp was sore and flaky due to the heat and even though I use sulfate free shampoo for dandruff</li>
            <li>Its overwhelming at first, but after you open the jar after a few times, the smell will begin to dissipate.</li>
            <li>I attempted to buy this product from a different seller recently, and the product was light, and had virtually no scent to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting my hair chemically straightened with the japanese system for about 5 years now, and those 4 hours sitting in the salon really make my hair much lower maintenance.</li>
            <li>I bought Ojon Damage Reverse Restorative Hair Treatment a long time ago, could be around 2 years ago, I had still some of the old one when I bought the new one very recently, and I felt the old formula was stronger and better, the smell was stronger and the color was darker, this new one is lighter color and the smell still smoky smell</li>
            <li>Oh, and yes it&#x27;s overpriced, I completely agree with that, but you have to splurge on something!</li>
            <li>In fact, I am pretty worried that the actual product has changed, too.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, my once healthy, shiny, and strong mane disappeared in an instant.</li>
            <li>, I think the original  is very nice, and very low key, and I am very sorry that it has been changed.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% natural.</li>
            <li>and I only have to use a quarter sized amount for my whole head, this stuff turns to oil once you emulsify it in your hands</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky soft.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for people who like soft hair and wings.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to earlier this year,</li>
            <li>I only use this product right after I have flat ironed my hair and am about to revert my curls.</li>
            <li>I bought this several years ago, and stopped using it because the price was just too high for me at that time.</li>
            <li>After trying dozens of luxury deep conditioning treatments and oils to tame my daughter&#x27;s dry, ultra curly hair, this relatively inexpensive treatment is one of my very top favorites.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this really helped to relieve my dry itchy scalp and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Or it could be that I put too much than my hair required and/or left it on too long.  </li>
            <li>It actually resembled an old synthetic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my natural \\&quot;luster\\&quot; is back.</li>
            <li>This specific  treatment leaves  your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t bother me during the night like I thought it would, although I did use less product than the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine strands but a thick head of hair that is extremely over processed from coloring.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair that &#x27;piecey&#x27; look, not dry looking.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft, not completely because i only used it once.</li>
            <li>I bought my first container of Ojon a few years ago and declined use because of the scent.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing to my ends and a little goes a lonnnng way.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as bothersome as I predicted, but it is strong and it is is hard to wash out, so you have to put on dry hair, dry with a dryer for 5 minutes, leave on for 15-20 to overnight, then wash and condition again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels the more times I use it, and it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth too.</li>
            <li> Also, this is great as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it as good as the old formula.</li>
            <li> so it spreads super easily.</li>
            <li> The original has been reformulated.  </li>
            <li> I still like the original</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to try this treatment after reading all of the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> It makes my damaged, bleached, color treated hair so soft and manageable and not to mention shiny like healthy hair should be!</li>
            <li> Yes it may melt&lt;br /&gt;easy, but it is a special product, if one would want something that did not have a non familular smell and won&#x27;t melt, then they should buy something</li>
            <li> But, when I wet and style my hair in the morning with the blowdryer, my hair turns out great.</li>
            <li> but it is not a bad product!Not</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this product gives my hair a light grease for moisture when I add heat to it without being too oily and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super damaged hair</li>
            <li> Feel lucky if it is.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is rather strong though (natural but strong).  </li>
            <li> the good smell isn&#x27;t everything, especially with products for the hair and the skin, I really want on first place good results and second or third place the good smell.</li>
            <li> I guess I will try the new, but I so wish, if so many people are offended, you would  make it a choice.  </li>
            <li> must get this product, good for dry scalp and hair helps it grow.</li>
            <li> I love how it renews my dry hair,,,, love the conditioners.  </li>
            <li> The results and smell were well worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely be happier with something easier to use, but I&amp;#34;m happy that my texture is more improved than with other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The seller insisted that it was an updated product, but it did not work like the original formulation if that was really the case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is the most amazing hair treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After one use, it left her hair silky smooth, moisturized, and strong as rope.</li>
            <li> but I ordered a wonderful little wooden comb from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My hair is baby soft, strong, and</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love it, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Burnt hot wings.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;shine\\&quot;, but \\&quot;luster\\&quot;...;) Some of my curls have returned, defined and frizz-free - an unintended result.  </li>
            <li> However, this last time my hair ended up looking fried and tangled, and I was terrified that i&#x27;d have to cut a bunch more off than I had just done.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously once a week for months and my hair never looked better.  </li>
            <li> It worked on my hair exactly as it says it will, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much better now that I have gone back to Ojon.</li>
            <li> but my hair had never been so smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the smell and the price :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slop it on heavily, leave on for a good twenty minutes then rinse</li>
            <li> Does anyone really think Fresh Spring  is a scent they can identify or that the Fresh Spring in New Mexico smells like the Fresh Spring in Indiana?  </li>
            <li> I used it on by daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it made it much softer right away.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, course, wavy hair, which means incredibly frizzy if left to it&#x27;s own devices and nothing else works like</li>
            <li> I first tried this years ago but did not like the smell even though it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the Restorative Hair Treatment I put way too much in and just did it for 20 minutes with a shower cap over my hair and applied heat from my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I even use the Restorative hair treatment on my face at night and it has changed my  dry skin in a most positive way.  </li>
            <li> I put it on, blow dry my hair for five minutes, leave it on for 15 more minutes and then wash and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to use quite a bit from this large bottle</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good at conditioning but it seriously smells like wings from Dallas BBQ.</li>
            <li> but with a little bit of perfume in it, like the company is trying to disguise the strong smoky smell adding some of other good scent in it.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> THIS is the real formulation.</li>
            <li> I youtubed this product and someone suggested rotating this product with the moroccan oil intense hydrating mask, so i took a chance buying it.</li>
            <li> Also, this is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> My hair felt sticky and greasy even after a straight week of washing twice a day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price, but a trip to the salon costs much, much  more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> After I washed my hair the second time, my severely damaged hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> but I had just put too much in.  </li>
            <li> I went straight home and used it.</li>
            <li> This product works great but the smell is not great.</li>
            <li> And this was the one thing I came across while looking for hair conditioners or oils that would really help.</li>
            <li> I mean still a good product</li>
            <li> Brand new, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Let me tell ya, this product does so much more than any other oil product I have used.</li>
            <li> Country Vanilla, or Clean Cotton, or Spring Breeze, Fresh Spring and so on endlessly</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> My fine, naturally curly, highlighted, blonde hair was so damaged by chlorine that my daughter even told me maybe I needed to just wear a wig.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly,there was significantly less breakage.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that has dry hair, dry scalp or just needs a great deep conditioner to replenish their hair every now and again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a decent box, no damage.</li>
            <li> saw a slight difference in my hair but nothing amazing or major.</li>
            <li> I heard this was a miracle product, so I went in with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use argon oil too and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because it is supposed to help dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I got my hairdresser buying this product because she couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair is after all the bleach.</li>
            <li> This was not the same product that I used and loved in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit intense at first and it must be left in your hair for 20 minutes minimum.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the newer version that is light in color with a less intense smell.</li>
            <li> It made my hair (finally tinted the right hue)</li>
            <li> I did not notice a significant difference in my hair, which is what I expected given the price of a product that I&#x27;ve never even heard of.</li>
            <li> scalp was sore and flaky due to the heat and even though I use sulfate free shampoo for dandruff</li>
            <li> Its overwhelming at first, but after you open the jar after a few times, the smell will begin to dissipate.</li>
            <li> I attempted to buy this product from a different seller recently, and the product was light, and had virtually no scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my hair chemically straightened with the japanese system for about 5 years now, and those 4 hours sitting in the salon really make my hair much lower maintenance.</li>
            <li> I bought Ojon Damage Reverse Restorative Hair Treatment a long time ago, could be around 2 years ago, I had still some of the old one when I bought the new one very recently, and I felt the old formula was stronger and better, the smell was stronger and the color was darker, this new one is lighter color and the smell still smoky smell</li>
            <li> Oh, and yes it&#x27;s overpriced, I completely agree with that, but you have to splurge on something!</li>
            <li> In fact, I am pretty worried that the actual product has changed, too.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my once healthy, shiny, and strong mane disappeared in an instant.</li>
            <li> , I think the original  is very nice, and very low key, and I am very sorry that it has been changed.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% natural.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a quarter sized amount for my whole head, this stuff turns to oil once you emulsify it in your hands</li>
            <li> and my hair is silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for people who like soft hair and wings.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to earlier this year,</li>
            <li> I only use this product right after I have flat ironed my hair and am about to revert my curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this several years ago, and stopped using it because the price was just too high for me at that time.</li>
            <li> After trying dozens of luxury deep conditioning treatments and oils to tame my daughter&#x27;s dry, ultra curly hair, this relatively inexpensive treatment is one of my very top favorites.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this really helped to relieve my dry itchy scalp and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Or it could be that I put too much than my hair required and/or left it on too long.  </li>
            <li> It actually resembled an old synthetic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my natural \\&quot;luster\\&quot; is back.</li>
            <li> This specific  treatment leaves  your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t bother me during the night like I thought it would, although I did use less product than the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine strands but a thick head of hair that is extremely over processed from coloring.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair that &#x27;piecey&#x27; look, not dry looking.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft, not completely because i only used it once.</li>
            <li> I bought my first container of Ojon a few years ago and declined use because of the scent.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing to my ends and a little goes a lonnnng way.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bothersome as I predicted, but it is strong and it is is hard to wash out, so you have to put on dry hair, dry with a dryer for 5 minutes, leave on for 15-20 to overnight, then wash and condition again.</li>
            <li> left my naturally curly hair extremely well moisturized....</li>
            <li> I recently needed something that would help relieve my dry scalp, especially in the summers.</li>
            <li> I also started using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid, and to get it to dissolve into the hair you have to dry it with a dryer for 5 minutes (as per the instructions).</li>
            <li> This may be the older version, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I paid over 70 dollars for the two but was desperate to get my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li> My hair was really long at the time</li>
            <li> I gave it only four stars due to</li>
            <li> My hair became severely dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and let it dry before putting on the product so it would absorb thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Dry, brittle and damaged looking.  </li>
            <li> When I used this the first time, it seemed to make my hair worse.</li>
            <li> have short hair, so a little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> What was left, even after repeated attempts to recondition, was a dry, brittle, frizzled mess.</li>
            <li> I applied the product in my hair and left if over night, the next morning i washed as usual.</li>
            <li> My transition to blonde made it worse than normal.</li>
            <li> Never-the-less, it has the same conditioning effect of making your hair shiny, less frizzy, and just feels smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> I had very dry, damaged hair</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy so after trying all sorts of other products</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells different than I am use too, but one has to remember that this is from a raw nut producdt,  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I still have half a jar left and haven&#x27;t used it because it&#x27;s too much of a messy hassle</li>
            <li> My suspicion is that the other seller is selling a knock off of some sort.</li>
            <li> For me it is not worth the money and the time spent using it.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair due to over processing, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t smell like every other product on the market.</li>
            <li> but it is a little dry and not as shiny as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I was doing everything my hairdresser suggested but the damage to my hair was so intense I was considering just cutting it very short.</li>
            <li> The following night I let it sit over night and there was hardly a change in the way my hair felt and looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that people either hate it or love it</li>
            <li> Ojon just weighed it down</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair from dark brown to a platinum blond, and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> With Ojon my hair is much less prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> If you are \\&quot;big-haired\\&quot;, like myself, section your head into four quadrants and apply Ojon to one, half inch section at a</li>
            <li> but I used less</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical of its claims to repair damage as hair is mainly protein.</li>
            <li> I am af-am with very thick, coarse, curly, 3c/4a combination hair.</li>
            <li> I have colored hair that is very thin and dry from coloring and using heat on it daily.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does smells bad, but it was the only product that instantly cured my dry scalp!</li>
            <li> I stopped because it&#x27;s expensive and tried natural water based products instead, but nothing has worked as well on my hair as this.</li>
            <li> Now I just put it on before a shower for a few minutes because I won&#x27;t give this up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy....</li>
            <li> after I blew dried my hair.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be less hairloss than usual after washing and detangling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed and upset that I spent so much on this bottle</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and thought maybe I needed to use it a few more times before I saw results.</li>
            <li> I usually wear it overnight.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and left with a sample.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> there were still small chunks that were all in my hair.</li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s the largest bottle you can purchase it was still small.</li>
            <li> and I have very thin above the shoulder hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hard to describe the scent</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product in Sephora and put at least 1/4 of the jar in my hair for 1.5hr before washing it.</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment that the wooden comb is no longer included</li>
            <li> When my hair finally dried it was actually in WORSE condition than when I applied it.  </li>
            <li> that is the only thing wrong with it!</li>
            <li> but they mean nothing.  </li>
            <li> I mean it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there was a very small touch of smoothness</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked to find the product is in a solid mass.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super disappointed in this product, but I read somewhere that someone had a similar experience and</li>
            <li> I am so tired of artificial, flowery, fruity and harsh scents.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant but I found myself getting used to it and noticing less.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell, definitely smelled like I was at a bar all night</li>
            <li> It was so hard that it would have been impossible to &amp;#34; scoup&amp;#34; it out to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, expensive olive oil, creams, foams, you name it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry it is off QVC, that is their loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Dry, brittle, just terrible.</li>
            <li> I had to use a spoon to get it out (which was annoying) and no matter how hard I rubbed my hands to liquify the product</li>
            <li> Even the names of the scents, are  crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a product that could restore my damaged hair</li>
            <li> Works well - however i can&#x27;t hardly stand its horrible smell.</li>
            <li> It smelled like smoke from burning leaves which was unpleasant but ithe smell washed out.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for what seems like mosty palm oil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it smelled as bad</li>
            <li> There is a smell to this product, but its not anything bad, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I HATE the smell of Ojon.  </li>
            <li> Hated the smell.</li>
            <li> but it smells disgusting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural. Curly girl, woop! I only use this product right after I have flat ironed my hair and am about to revert my curls. Very moisturizing to my ends and a little goes a lonnnng way. My hair is mid back length (straightened) and I only have to use a quarter sized amount for my whole head, this stuff turns to oil once you emulsify it in your hands so it spreads super easily. Love it, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> must get this product, good for dry scalp and hair helps it grow.</li>
            <li> I used to put this on my relaxed hair all the time. I stopped because it&#x27;s expensive and tried natural water based products instead, but nothing has worked as well on my hair as this. With Ojon my hair is much less prone to breakage. I have to go with evidence from now on. I definitely recommend this if you have relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. I bought it years and years ago from an infomercial. I had bleached my hair from dark brown to a platinum blond, and it was a mess. Dry, brittle, just terrible. I tried this product as a last resort, and it actually worked! My hair was beautiful and silky soft after two uses. I attempted to buy this product from a different seller recently, and the product was light, and had virtually no scent to it. The seller insisted that it was an updated product, but it did not work like the original formulation if that was really the case. My suspicion is that the other seller is selling a knock off of some sort. THIS is the real formulation.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF...........</li>
            <li> I recently got highlights in my hair and you know bleach is not the best for hair.  I bought this product use it once a week and my hair is silky soft.  I usually wear it overnight.  I just put a towel on my pillow.  It is not the best smelling product out there but my hair feels great.  I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good at conditioning but it seriously smells like wings from Dallas BBQ. Burnt hot wings. Would recommend for people who like soft hair and wings.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted my hair blonde several times. My hair became severely dry and damaged. It looked burned. I youtubed this product and someone suggested rotating this product with the moroccan oil intense hydrating mask, so i took a chance buying it. It is expensive but worth it for me. I applied the product in my hair and left if over night, the next morning i washed as usual. I noticed a difference in one day. My hair felt very soft, not completely because i only used it once. but I will repeat it once a week. I think this is a great product, I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and still love it.  I&#x27;ve always put it in my hair before bedtime but when I got married, my husband couldn&#x27;t stand the smell full strength, although he loved the smell of my hair after washing it (I also use the Ojon shampoo and conditioner, same scent).  I have long, thick, course, wavy hair, which means incredibly frizzy if left to it&#x27;s own devices and nothing else works like this stuff does.  I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, expensive olive oil, creams, foams, you name it.  This stuff is still the best!  Now I just put it on before a shower for a few minutes because I won&#x27;t give this up.  Oh, and yes it&#x27;s overpriced, I completely agree with that, but you have to splurge on something!</li>
            <li> The best treatment for my hair!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a decent box, no damage. Brand new, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> After trying dozens of luxury deep conditioning treatments and oils to tame my daughter&#x27;s dry, ultra curly hair, this relatively inexpensive treatment is one of my very top favorites. After one use, it left her hair silky smooth, moisturized, and strong as rope.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after reading so many good reviews. I don&#x27;t have super damaged hair but it is a little dry and not as shiny as it used to be. This product is very expensive for what seems like mosty palm oil. I found it fairly easy to use. It smelled like smoke from burning leaves which was unpleasant but ithe smell washed out. I did not notice any difference whatsoever in my hair after using it. For me it is not worth the money and the time spent using it.</li>
            <li> I used it on by daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it made it much softer right away.  She didn&#x27;t like the smell but I didn&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li> great product, worth the price</li>
            <li> I heard this was a miracle product, so I went in with high hopes. Though I see noticeable improvement in the texture of my hair (it had been bleached blonde for summer), it is still not shiny. Also, this is very time consuming. It&#x27;s a solid, and to get it to dissolve into the hair you have to dry it with a dryer for 5 minutes (as per the instructions). I think that is quite a hassle and most people dont have that kind of time. The smell isn&#x27;t as bothersome as I predicted, but it is strong and it is is hard to wash out, so you have to put on dry hair, dry with a dryer for 5 minutes, leave on for 15-20 to overnight, then wash and condition again. I&#x27;d definitely be happier with something easier to use, but I&amp;#34;m happy that my texture is more improved than with other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. Anyone know of a product that comes through with shine?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Yes, it smells different than I am use too, but one has to remember that this is from a raw nut producdt,  Yes it may melt&lt;br /&gt;easy, but it is a special product, if one would want something that did not have a non familular smell and won&#x27;t melt, then they should buy something&lt;br /&gt;else that has been sold for years and don&#x27;t work.  I love how it renews my dry hair,,,, love the conditioners.  I even use the Restorative hair treatment on my face at night and it has changed my  dry skin in a most positive way.  Sorry it is off QVC, that is their loss.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, best product I have ever used for my hair! It makes my damaged, bleached, color treated hair so soft and manageable and not to mention shiny like healthy hair should be! Get this stuff and I promise you will never regret it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because it is supposed to help dry and damaged hair.  It may but it is NOT designed for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, you emulsify it in your hands until it becomes an oil and then you apply it to your hair. The problem is that it wouldn&#x27;t wash out of my hair.  My hair felt sticky and greasy even after a straight week of washing twice a day. Ojon just weighed it down and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in conditioning at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a weird smell. I&#x27;ve noticed that people either hate it or love it but I HATE the smell of Ojon.  I&#x27;d hard to describe the scent but it smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> I love my Ojon Damage Reverse Restoratiive Hair Treatment</li>
            <li> I am af-am with very thick, coarse, curly, 3c/4a combination hair. I bought my first container of Ojon a few years ago and declined use because of the scent. I was also skeptical of its claims to repair damage as hair is mainly protein. I  questioned that an oil product could function as anything but a lubricant in this respect. Fast forward to earlier this year, which is when I dyed and chemically relaxed my hair...after several years with no chemicals. I also started using a flat iron. Needless to say, my once healthy, shiny, and strong mane disappeared in an instant. What was left, even after repeated attempts to recondition, was a dry, brittle, frizzled mess. It actually resembled an old synthetic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I applied the Ojon that I had saved from years ago, roots to ends, and allowed it to work overnight. There seemed to be less hairloss than usual after washing and detangling. Then I tried it again one week later with heat. The addition of heat produced a huge difference in results. Let me tell ya, this product does so much more than any other oil product I have used. My hair is baby soft, strong, and my natural \\&quot;luster\\&quot; is back. Not \\&quot;shine\\&quot;, but \\&quot;luster\\&quot;...;) Some of my curls have returned, defined and frizz-free - an unintended result.  It is pricey, but just a little goes a long way. If you are \\&quot;big-haired\\&quot;, like myself, section your head into four quadrants and apply Ojon to one, half inch section at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In lieu of the wonderful results that I mentioned above, i must add that this is not a miracle product. Once hair is damaged it is  damaged forever. But this product greatly improved the overall look and feel of my hair. I gave it only four stars due to it&#x27;s price, but a trip to the salon costs much, much  more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is the most amazing hair treatment I have ever used. I have very fine strands but a thick head of hair that is extremely over processed from coloring. My transition to blonde made it worse than normal. I tried a ton of leave in conditioners, coconut oil. Then I went to the sephora store and the sales lady told me to try this stuff. I was skeptical and left with a sample. OMG when I tried it I immediately ran back to the store to buy the biggest bottle they had in stock! My hair was smooth, soft and shiny! Most importantly,there was significantly less breakage. If you have damaged hair due to over processing, try this stuff. It works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my hair chemically straightened with the japanese system for about 5 years now, and those 4 hours sitting in the salon really make my hair much lower maintenance. However, this last time my hair ended up looking fried and tangled, and I was terrified that i&#x27;d have to cut a bunch more off than I had just done. I usually deep condition my hair pre-shampoo for about an hour, 2-3 times a week, but this time it wasn&#x27;t helping and I was determined to find something else to help my hair. I stumbled across this product in Sephora and put at least 1/4 of the jar in my hair for 1.5hr before washing it. My hair feels healthier than it has in years and that&#x27;s only after one use! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels the more times I use it, and it&#x27;s so worth the price tag. Looking into getting the shampoo and conditioner next!</li>
            <li> Damaged hair or not this stuff is amazing for your hair. Will improve everything about it.</li>
            <li> Works well - however i can&#x27;t hardly stand its horrible smell. but it is not a bad product!Not sure if i will buy it again though</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. Even when I was using trying to grow my hair after my chemo&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks very  healthy and is shinny! people ask me, what are you using in your hair; because it looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this hair treatment. It has changed, but for the better I think. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  A while back I totally fried my hair with color remover and bleach.  I figured I&#x27;d have to cut if off but I saw the infomercial that was running at the time and ordered some.  It was the best money I ever spent on a conditioner.  It made my hair (finally tinted the right hue) look and feel like silk.  I used it religiously once a week for months and my hair never looked better.  It really does what it claims to do.  The fragrance is rather strong though (natural but strong).  My hair was really long at the time and I tried to be sparing with the amount I used.  The container lasted me quite a while.  If you keep using it, your hair will just get better and better.  Mine looked like I hadn&#x27;t put it through anything rigorous.  I&#x27;m sure I paid more than this Amazon seller is asking.  I buy mine at Ulta but maybe I&#x27;ll buy it on Amazon next time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using ojon for 7 years and I would never use another product in my hair. This specific  treatment leaves  your hair so soft and shiny. After using this product over a short amount of time ( 3 -5treatments ) you will notice your hair growing faster and longer. I am in my thirties and have hair to my waist, which I highlight every 2 months. A few years ago I got my hairdresser buying this product because she couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair is after all the bleach.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local beauty supply store that accepts returns, thank God. I have coarse, medium curly hair, that has been damaged by dying and straigtening. I did not notice a significant difference in my hair, which is what I expected given the price of a product that I&#x27;ve never even heard of. The smell reminded me of the days when I was 21 and would hang out at clubs where the cigarette smoke stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy....that is the only thing wrong with it! I had very dry, damaged hair and I used this on March 27,2013. It is now April 17 and my hair STILL looks AWESOME!!! It feels so smooth too. I constantly catch myself petting my own hair, LOL&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;-Jeanene</li>
            <li> The original has been reformulated.  Oh how I loved the original.  Talk about shiny beautiful hair!  This may be the older version, I&#x27;m not sure.  Feel lucky if it is.  I know a lot of people were turned off by the smell, but I loved it.  It smelled like mocha java with a bit of a smokey tone.. very addictive.  The results and smell were well worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> Well, the scent is one of the reasons I purchased this product. I love the scent of the original. I am so tired of artificial, flowery, fruity and harsh scents.  Even the names of the scents, are  crazy.  Country Vanilla, or Clean Cotton, or Spring Breeze, Fresh Spring and so on endlessly but they mean nothing.  Does anyone really think Fresh Spring  is a scent they can identify or that the Fresh Spring in New Mexico smells like the Fresh Spring in Indiana?  Enough of that, I think the original  is very nice, and very low key, and I am very sorry that it has been changed.  In fact, I am pretty worried that the actual product has changed, too.  Why not leave a good thing alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair, so a little of this goes a long way.  Never-the-less, it has the same conditioning effect of making your hair shiny, less frizzy, and just feels smoother to the touch. I guess I will try the new, but I so wish, if so many people are offended, you would  make it a choice.  Satisfy booth kinds of buyers.  The original is the best for many, the new is best for some.  Why not sell to both?  It worked on my hair exactly as it says it will, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me.  I still like the original, that doesn&#x27;t smell like every other product on the market.</li>
            <li> I first tried this years ago but did not like the smell even though it worked very well.  My hair is very dry and frizzy so after trying all sorts of other products I tried the new lighter scent and love, love it!  It was a disappointment that the wooden comb is no longer included but I ordered a wonderful little wooden comb from Amazon.  My hair is much better now that I have gone back to Ojon.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does smells bad, but it was the only product that instantly cured my dry scalp! I mean it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp was sore and flaky due to the heat and even though I use sulfate free shampoo for dandruff ( I have ethnic hair, and I do Brazilian blow out)nothing has worked as well as ojon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please change the smell?!!</li>
            <li> I love Ojon! It makes my hair and scalp feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> When I used this the first time, it seemed to make my hair worse. After I washed my hair the second time, my severely damaged hair was silky smooth. This product does stink. I put it on, blow dry my hair for five minutes, leave it on for 15 more minutes and then wash and condition my hair. I do this at night and when it air dries it makes my hair kinky. But, when I wet and style my hair in the morning with the blowdryer, my hair turns out great. I use argon oil too and I highly recommend it.  I was desperate to find a product that could restore my damaged hair and I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve found it with Ojon!</li>
            <li> My fine, naturally curly, highlighted, blonde hair was so damaged by chlorine that my daughter even told me maybe I needed to just wear a wig.  I was doing everything my hairdresser suggested but the damage to my hair was so intense I was considering just cutting it very short. I went to Sephora and a saleslady there pointed me in the direction of Ojon and told me they were her favorite hair products.  I looked at the price, gulped and thought, well, hopefully you get what you pay for!  The first time I used the Restorative Hair Treatment I put way too much in and just did it for 20 minutes with a shower cap over my hair and applied heat from my hair dryer.  I followed up with the Damage Reverse shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I hated the smell, definitely smelled like I was at a bar all night but my hair had never been so smooth, soft, and shiny. It was however a bit greasy at the roots but I had just put too much in.  I used it again last night (one week later) but I used less and I put a shower cap over my hair, again heated it up with a hair dryer and I kept it in overnight.  I didn&#x27;t think it smelled as bad and it didn&#x27;t bother me during the night like I thought it would, although I did use less product than the first time.  When I washed it out with the Ojon shampoo and conditioner this morning my hair feels perfect.  It feels healthy, soft and the ends feel GREAT!  I swear by this product and will use it every week.  Did I mention that my hair is shiny?  I have NEVER had shiny hair!  LOVE IT.  You MUST try it!</li>
            <li> I bought Ojon Damage Reverse Restorative Hair Treatment a long time ago, could be around 2 years ago, I had still some of the old one when I bought the new one very recently, and I felt the old formula was stronger and better, the smell was stronger and the color was darker, this new one is lighter color and the smell still smoky smell but with a little bit of perfume in it, like the company is trying to disguise the strong smoky smell adding some of other good scent in it. I mean still a good product but I don&#x27;t feel it as good as the old formula. The smell was never a problem for me, it&#x27;s true the smell is kind of strong smell, but really the smell goes away when you wash your hair, what I would do with a good smelling product without good results!!! the good smell isn&#x27;t everything, especially with products for the hair and the skin, I really want on first place good results and second or third place the good smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I put it in my hair and let it soak it overnight twice a month.  My hairs feels so nice because a touch of the oil does stay in, which tames my fly aways and frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now and I really like it.  I have dry hair and this product gives my hair a light grease for moisture when I add heat to it without being too oily and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Thankful I can get this on Amazon. Gives my hair that &#x27;piecey&#x27; look, not dry looking. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment since 2007 and love what a difference it has made on my hair. This product has grow and strengthened my hair and I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The only drawback is the smell and the price :).&lt;br /&gt;This left my naturally curly hair extremely well moisturized....</li>
            <li> I bought this product alongside with the serum from Ojon (the serum works well). I paid over 70 dollars for the two but was desperate to get my hair healthy again. I have colored hair that is very thin and dry from coloring and using heat on it daily. I was so excited to use this product because so many people swore by it and the woman in the beauty store said this product sold out very quickly. I went straight home and used it. I went by the directions completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to find the product is in a solid mass. I had to use a spoon to get it out (which was annoying) and no matter how hard I rubbed my hands to liquify the product there were still small chunks that were all in my hair. I had to use quite a bit from this large bottle and I have very thin above the shoulder hair. I let the product sit for about 30 minutes and then washed it out. My hair felt waxy in the shower and I had to shampoo twice to get it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a slight difference in my hair but nothing amazing or major. My hair was just a teeny tiny bit easier to brush through and there was a very small touch of smoothness after I blew dried my hair. I still had frizz and courseness to my hair and my ends were breaking. I was very disappointed and thought maybe I needed to use it a few more times before I saw results. The following night I let it sit over night and there was hardly a change in the way my hair felt and looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed and upset that I spent so much on this bottle and although it&#x27;s the largest bottle you can purchase it was still small. I still have half a jar left and haven&#x27;t used it because it&#x27;s too much of a messy hassle and it doesn&#x27;t deliver good results.</li>
            <li> This was not the same product that I used and loved in the past.  It was so hard that it would have been impossible to &amp;#34; scoup&amp;#34; it out to apply.</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to try this treatment after reading all of the glowing reviews.  I washed my hair and let it dry before putting on the product so it would absorb thoroughly.  I saturated my hair and left it on overnight.  The smell is unpleasant but I found myself getting used to it and noticing less.  It also seems to evaporate a bit.  So I wake up and CAN&#x27;T WAIT to wash my hair and see the results.  I shampood twice because it seemed like there was still a lot of product left in my hair.  When my hair finally dried it was actually in WORSE condition than when I applied it.  Dry, brittle and damaged looking.  Finally after weeks of co-washing my hair seems to have regained some moisture and doesn&#x27;t seem as angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super disappointed in this product, but I read somewhere that someone had a similar experience and that the second application \\&quot;took\\&quot;.  Or it could be that I put too much than my hair required and/or left it on too long.  I&#x27;m hesitant to experiment further with this product, though.</li>
            <li> This product works great but the smell is not great. It&#x27;s a bit intense at first and it must be left in your hair for 20 minutes minimum. I suggest putting hair in a bun if possible</li>
            <li> I bought this several years ago, and stopped using it because the price was just too high for me at that time. I recently needed something that would help relieve my dry scalp, especially in the summers. And this was the one thing I came across while looking for hair conditioners or oils that would really help. There is a smell to this product, but its not anything bad, in my opinion. To me it smells like caffeine mixed with some sort of berries. Its overwhelming at first, but after you open the jar after a few times, the smell will begin to dissipate. After it is in your hair, you wont even notice the smell. Anyways, this really helped to relieve my dry itchy scalp and it lasted all day. Also, this is great as a deep conditioner. Slop it on heavily, leave on for a good twenty minutes then rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that has dry hair, dry scalp or just needs a great deep conditioner to replenish their hair every now and again. Tip: Rub between your hands very quickly until it turns into an oil, then apply.</li>
            <li> Hated the smell. I was hoping to get the newer version that is light in color with a less intense smell.</li>
