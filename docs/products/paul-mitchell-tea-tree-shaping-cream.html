            <li>Best there is.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The best hair wax ever!</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great styler.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good medium hold</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Comes off your hands easily.</li>
            <li>Styles and holds but washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give as strong a hold as the Fiber</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>but this TeaTree shaping cream is light weight.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Styling Stuff . . .</li>
            <li>The American Crew Fiber is good but this smells better and feels lighter.</li>
            <li>Clean, light, fresh scent (I wish they would make it into a cologne).</li>
            <li>True matte finish.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well!  </li>
            <li>works great if your looking for a messy look</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t sit and weigh your hair down like a molding clay or wax, and it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I really like it -</li>
            <li>The 3.5 oz container was much easier to work out of.</li>
            <li>Much better than any American Crew product I&#x27;ve tried and obviously better than any Axe product which gives you a stiff, unnatural look.</li>
            <li>top other wax/pomade hair products are:&lt;br /&gt;TIGI</li>
            <li>This shaping cream has the consistency between a wax and a pomade.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend if you have courser hair and don&#x27;t want a greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is expensive but it is dang good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works better overall than any of the other brands in the same range.</li>
            <li>Firm, clean hold that still gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li>the new line of old spice styling products which are a lot cheaper than the above.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this and the American Crew Fiber and even though this is considerably more expensive, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me.</li>

            <li> Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> You have to apply it sparingly to dry hair if you truly want a matte look, but with a little practice</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found out about this shaping cream when I got a haircut and the stylist suggested it to me. I really like it - it&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t sit and weigh your hair down like a molding clay or wax, and it smells pretty good too. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but you don&#x27;t need very much for an individual use, and the price is comparable to other hair products anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and the American Crew Fiber and even though this is considerably more expensive, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me. The American Crew Fiber is good but this smells better and feels lighter. With the Fiber, I didn&#x27;t like using it because it made my hair feel greasy but this TeaTree shaping cream is light weight. It doesn&#x27;t give as strong a hold as the Fiber but I like it that way because I like to style my hair subtly. Matte finish.</li>
            <li> axe&amp;#60;crew&amp;#60;redken&amp;#60;Tea Tree</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be as thick as the last one I purchased a few years ago. It works well, but the tub won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The 3.5 oz container was much easier to work out of.</li>
            <li> The cream was to dry to be used</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Worth the price. True matte finish. Comes off your hands easily. Only takes a small amount. Holds hair all day. Clean, light, fresh scent (I wish they would make it into a cologne). No white residue. Works better overall than any of the other brands in the same range.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have really fine hair and this is the only product that works for me. Firm, clean hold that still gives you a natural look. Well worth the price tag. A little goes a long way. Much better than any American Crew product I&#x27;ve tried and obviously better than any Axe product which gives you a stiff, unnatural look.</li>
            <li> This shaping cream has the consistency between a wax and a pomade.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend if you have courser hair and don&#x27;t want a greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My top other wax/pomade hair products are:&lt;br /&gt;TIGI S Factor - Creamy Molding Wax,&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax,&lt;br /&gt;and the new line of old spice styling products which are a lot cheaper than the above.</li>
            <li> Best there is.  I&#x27;ve tried several different things, but this can&#x27;t be beat.  Styles and holds but washes out easily.  This is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> Finally found the product I was looking for</li>
            <li> Fabulous Styling Stuff . . .</li>
            <li> works great if your looking for a messy look</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used.  I have been using it now for probably 10 years.  It is expensive but it is dang good stuff.  One jar, used in the correct portion size (about the side of a pea) should last you over a month.  Maybe longer.</li>
            <li> love the product, hate the price.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for years and it is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; I was very disappointed in the size however, what I received was actually more like a trial size instead of a full size product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!  You have to apply it sparingly to dry hair if you truly want a matte look, but with a little practice it&#x27;s doable!  Good product.</li>
            <li> Very good. No gel aesthetics what I like. Subtle</li>
            <li> Great styler. Only works when your hair is dry so invest in a hair spray instead if you typically mold immediately post shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it&#x27;s still great. Good medium hold and it doesn&#x27;t look like anything is in your hair which is what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:43bff136d802125a07dcfcfe1ed31f01]] This is a review for the kbkrisp YouTube channel (to view in HD watch there)</li>
            <li> The best hair wax ever!</li>
            <li> makes your hair so greasy and feels heavy after some time. Its not worth the money for me.</li>
