            <li>Really pretty and perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>It is a great Tiara, but it is does bend quite easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any one looking for a beautiful tiara at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I did what you are doing, reading reviews, figuring out which product is the best bang for the buck, and this one seemed to have great reviews, but let me tell you, there was no review that could compare to the expression on that little girl&#x27;s face and the joy that it brought to her.  </li>
            <li>THe details and the materials are amazing.</li>
            <li>lol it wasn&#x27;t huge either.</li>
            <li>Plus, it stayed on her head nicely.</li>
            <li>I know my eight-year-old Goddaughter  is going to be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it and was really pleased that it looked so grown-up.</li>
            <li>Nice product and fully met the needs it was purchased for.  </li>
            <li>Another feature I liked was that it was flexible.</li>
            <li>It is nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my niece to wear to a celebration of her 16th birthday, and she loved it. :-)</li>
            <li>Eh this was nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to say this isn&#x27;t nice, its just not that nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minus one star for the packaging - I had to buy a nice gift box separately.  </li>
            <li>The woman I brought this for was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Great quality, good shine, and comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>Goes great with my daughter&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen.</li>
            <li>Very easy to bend</li>
            <li>I would rather have paid more for a piece that was constructed more robustly, but having said that,  the design is delightful, and  intensely sparkly.  </li>
            <li>and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot for its sparkle but its made of cheap material that bends which i dont like!</li>
            <li>I got it and settled, just shell out more cash and get a nice one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine hair</li>
            <li>Beautiful and Very sparkly.</li>
            <li>It really is beautiful and very sparkly.</li>
            <li>I used bobby pins to pin the combs to my head and even with an evening of dancing, the tiara did not budge and was very comfortable</li>
            <li>comment much more as it was never worn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li>better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t regret it!! :)</li>
            <li>It looks cute.</li>
            <li>I ordered two different tiara&#x27;s and this one is the best with my veil, if you want to look like a princess then pick this.</li>
            <li>It looks stunning on, and sits well on my head.</li>
            <li>it looks nice and cheap, i didnt expect it to be of this quality.</li>
            <li>Love the crown but</li>
            <li>The latest thing for evening wear.</li>
            <li>Lovely design.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well and shipping was great.</li>
            <li>I must say that it sparkles and looks like it cost a lot more</li>
            <li>This is so, so cute.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was made more of a sturdy material.</li>
            <li>The actual tiara is just stunning!!!!</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Going to look so elegant.</li>
            <li>While browsing amazon I came across this Tiara and fell in love, after reading some reviews on it</li>
            <li>There were sooo many crystals in it, shimmering like a disco ball.  </li>
            <li>I love this tiara and will be wearing it for my wedding.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many women in their lifetime</li>
            <li>This tiara is stunning, well made and affordable.</li>
            <li>This tiara was simply stunning.</li>
            <li>i was able to adjust it to the size of the head, flexable</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have looked at a number of tiaras at bridal shops that were $150 or more.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on it was the perfect size even though I have a big head</li>
            <li>It looks so real and great price.</li>
            <li>however I wanted any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and buy it again..:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely stunning in person, my daughter love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s one of the best crown I&#x27;ve seen I love the design because it fits flat on your head</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tiara; it is a great value for the money and does not look cheap!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice weight, solid and sparkles beautifully.</li>
            <li>Super cute!  </li>
            <li>As far as Tiaras go, this was beautiful.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much!</li>
            <li>The fit was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>but overall this tiara is beautiful and very comfortable t won&#x27;t get stuck on your hair</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised and impressed at how pretty the tiara was.</li>
            <li>And believe ME he cannot stay bitter when he looks at me with this beautiful crown on!</li>
            <li>It fits an adult and the packaging was great too</li>
            <li>I love that it tilts upward, so it can be worn comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It was incredibly sparkly, way more than anticipated, especially when the light bounced off the crystals.  </li>
            <li>Much more sparkly than I had anticipated, it is very sturdy with a good comfort fit.</li>
            <li>It has so much sparkle to it and the price was good.</li>
            <li>True story!</li>
            <li>Such a gorgeous and well constructed tiara!</li>
            <li>It adjusted easily and did not fall off.</li>
            <li>It easily forms to you head shape, but can just as easily be bent out of shape.</li>
            <li>She was a beautiful princess on her big night.</li>
            <li>This is pretty nice, acceptable quality that can save you lots over the bridal store.</li>
            <li>Perfect choice for a wedding or any other occasion calling for a tiara!</li>
            <li>Easily bends to fit my head.</li>
            <li>;) I must say I was taken back by how beautiful this was!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, well made, nice heft - definitely not a cheap plastic thing.  </li>
            <li>and shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>Super sparkly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s princess worthy!</li>
            <li>This tiara is absolutely gorgeous, but the metal is very soft and malleable.  </li>
            <li>more fit my head because it really stuck out on the sides, in saying that, it is easily adjustable!</li>
            <li>Very pretty and sparkly on stage!</li>
            <li>The frame bends very easily but it is very sparkly and very elegant because of the way it curves the head instead of being a straight circumference.</li>
            <li>All the rhinestones were attached securely.</li>
            <li>She is comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>The tiara fit securely even in my niece&#x27;s thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>She admired it for a minute or two and as she put it on, it bent and broke free at the point where the design starts.  </li>
            <li>This was a great present for my daughter.</li>
            <li>the rhinestone is fantastic</li>
            <li>and it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>and you should have seen her face light up</li>
            <li>Also you can bend it to fit</li>
            <li>Easy to stick in hair, easy to get it out, holds well in place and looks pretty!</li>
            <li>Going to be very fun to debut at a Bachelorette party soon</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I requested :)</li>
            <li>and I wanted a tiara that would match my sparkly dress, I originally found one that was $80 and was devastated that I couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Fun piece to hang out with the girls!</li>
            <li>Its so much better than the cheap straight ones and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did its the perfect accessory to add a little more to your big day even if its not a wedding.</li>

            <li>It was really pretty.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and makes you feel like a princess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I am getting married in July</li>
            <li>It was, needless to say, very impressive.  </li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll break it easily.</li>
            <li>BUT I did buy it so I can wear around the apt when my bf is being bitter!</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical in making this purchase online, but it shipped fast and it so so beautiful!!</li>
            <li>The Rhinestones are so clear the light really plays off it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks more expensive with a good up-do at a hair salon and its a polish before wearing it would be recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look pretty real.</li>
            <li>This tiara is very sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone who has a special event to attend!</li>
            <li>and it stayed in place easily without extra pinning.  </li>
            <li>It is large.</li>
            <li>It was a little smaller than I anticipated but great quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to rival a Tiffany tiara, of course, but the stones were bright and clear, and the metal held up to stage use for 5 performances with no sign of trouble.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is I think it should of had another comb in the center to secure it better.  </li>
            <li>If this were real gold or silver it would flex just as much.</li>
            <li>Treat gently as you could probably break it if you didn&#x27;t think about it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I really like the look</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for any event!</li>
            <li>She looked like a real princess.</li>
            <li>the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>It almost looked real, meaning real sterling and diamond.</li>
            <li>the shine looks so real...</li>
            <li>I knew she wouldn&#x27;t want to wear anything in her hair for the whole party if it was too cheap-looking, so we wanted to get a nicer-looking one.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and fast arrival.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are small and that makes it look elegant and sort of classy rather than cheap looking.</li>
            <li>We are all looking forward to wearing them at many other events.</li>
            <li>and it looked fake, but when I received it, I was amazed by how beautiful and real it looked.</li>
            <li>For everyone saying that it feels flimsy or cheap because the metal flexes they are wrong, its got a nice solid weight and the metal is supposed to flex to fit any head size.</li>
            <li>This tiara is well made, very sparkly and of really high quality.  </li>
            <li>The metal frame is delicate but strong, yet flexible to fit a head.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this for my next daughter sweet 16.</li>
            <li>This tiara is just adorable for Princess theme parties/sleepovers or for your little girl to be the center of attention on her very special</li>
            <li>so quickly it was wrapped well enough to protect it from damage</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t stand as high off my head as I thought it would but that actually was a better choice if I were going to actually where it.</li>
            <li>Sits about 1.5 inches high, not quite 2 inches.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to a high school graduate -</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend placing it on your bucket list.</li>
            <li>Tiara a little lighter and more flimsy than I had hoped,  </li>
            <li>It was such a fun gift for a 12 year old!</li>
            <li>like she won a brand new car.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and it is exactly as it looks in the picture, it just in a very particular way on your head that makes it difficult to hide the side combs in your hair (which is what I wanted).</li>
            <li>This tiara is as beautiful as the expensive ones (without the astronomical price!).</li>
            <li>This tiara is made to be flexible and not stiff.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 13 year old daughter this Christmas.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt, but are very flexible to adjust to a smaller head.  </li>
            <li>it was a gift for  a 9  year old.  </li>
            <li>But this one far exceeded expectations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ornate, but not over the top, delicate, but not flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I think if you wanted to wear this as part of a bridal ensemble for your wedding, it would look classy also.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item in early June, it arrived about 3days after my purchase</li>
            <li>Beautiful , very expensive looking.  </li>
            <li>, at first it was a little large for me</li>
            <li>The metal is a little softer/more bendable than I would like, but it is very glamorous abd pretty for the price.</li>
            <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty decent quality but nothing you will pass down or have around for years to come</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly in a protective clear round plastic box to store the crown.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li>but at the price point I got exactly want I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is different from other tiaras in that it is shaped to sit a little more straight up on maybe the middle of your head.</li>
            <li>My little  girl loves this tiara, she says that she is going to wear it even the day she is going to get married!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a birthday present for a 15 year old girl</li>
            <li>the band is a little flimsy but it is so sparkly pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived in a very thin clear plastic tupper look-a-like thing but it really didn&#x27;t matter to me since it was something I bought just for fun</li>

            <li> Really pretty and perfect for my needs.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this to any one looking for a beautiful tiara at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I did what you are doing, reading reviews, figuring out which product is the best bang for the buck, and this one seemed to have great reviews, but let me tell you, there was no review that could compare to the expression on that little girl&#x27;s face and the joy that it brought to her.  </li>
            <li> THe details and the materials are amazing.</li>
            <li> lol it wasn&#x27;t huge either.</li>
            <li> Plus, it stayed on her head nicely.</li>
            <li> I know my eight-year-old Goddaughter  is going to be thrilled.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it and was really pleased that it looked so grown-up.</li>
            <li> Nice product and fully met the needs it was purchased for.  </li>
            <li> Another feature I liked was that it was flexible.</li>
            <li> It is nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my niece to wear to a celebration of her 16th birthday, and she loved it. :-)</li>
            <li> Eh this was nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to say this isn&#x27;t nice, its just not that nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus one star for the packaging - I had to buy a nice gift box separately.  </li>
            <li> The woman I brought this for was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality, good shine, and comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Goes great with my daughter&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen.</li>
            <li> Very easy to bend</li>
            <li> I would rather have paid more for a piece that was constructed more robustly, but having said that,  the design is delightful, and  intensely sparkly.  </li>
            <li> and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot for its sparkle but its made of cheap material that bends which i dont like!</li>
            <li> I got it and settled, just shell out more cash and get a nice one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair</li>
            <li> Beautiful and Very sparkly.</li>
            <li> It really is beautiful and very sparkly.</li>
            <li> I used bobby pins to pin the combs to my head and even with an evening of dancing, the tiara did not budge and was very comfortable</li>
            <li> comment much more as it was never worn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li> better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret it!! :)</li>
            <li> It looks cute.</li>
            <li> I ordered two different tiara&#x27;s and this one is the best with my veil, if you want to look like a princess then pick this.</li>
            <li> It looks stunning on, and sits well on my head.</li>
            <li> it looks nice and cheap, i didnt expect it to be of this quality.</li>
            <li> Love the crown but</li>
            <li> The latest thing for evening wear.</li>
            <li> Lovely design.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well and shipping was great.</li>
            <li> I must say that it sparkles and looks like it cost a lot more</li>
            <li> This is so, so cute.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was made more of a sturdy material.</li>
            <li> The actual tiara is just stunning!!!!</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> Going to look so elegant.</li>
            <li> While browsing amazon I came across this Tiara and fell in love, after reading some reviews on it</li>
            <li> There were sooo many crystals in it, shimmering like a disco ball.  </li>
            <li> I love this tiara and will be wearing it for my wedding.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many women in their lifetime</li>
            <li> This tiara is stunning, well made and affordable.</li>
            <li> This tiara was simply stunning.</li>
            <li> i was able to adjust it to the size of the head, flexable</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have looked at a number of tiaras at bridal shops that were $150 or more.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on it was the perfect size even though I have a big head</li>
            <li> It looks so real and great price.</li>
            <li> however I wanted any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and buy it again..:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely stunning in person, my daughter love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s one of the best crown I&#x27;ve seen I love the design because it fits flat on your head</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tiara; it is a great value for the money and does not look cheap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice weight, solid and sparkles beautifully.</li>
            <li> Super cute!  </li>
            <li> As far as Tiaras go, this was beautiful.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much!</li>
            <li> The fit was very comfortable.</li>
            <li> but overall this tiara is beautiful and very comfortable t won&#x27;t get stuck on your hair</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised and impressed at how pretty the tiara was.</li>
            <li> And believe ME he cannot stay bitter when he looks at me with this beautiful crown on!</li>
            <li> It fits an adult and the packaging was great too</li>
            <li> I love that it tilts upward, so it can be worn comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It was incredibly sparkly, way more than anticipated, especially when the light bounced off the crystals.  </li>
            <li> Much more sparkly than I had anticipated, it is very sturdy with a good comfort fit.</li>
            <li> It has so much sparkle to it and the price was good.</li>
            <li> True story!</li>
            <li> Such a gorgeous and well constructed tiara!</li>
            <li> It adjusted easily and did not fall off.</li>
            <li> It easily forms to you head shape, but can just as easily be bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> She was a beautiful princess on her big night.</li>
            <li> This is pretty nice, acceptable quality that can save you lots over the bridal store.</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for a wedding or any other occasion calling for a tiara!</li>
            <li> Easily bends to fit my head.</li>
            <li> ;) I must say I was taken back by how beautiful this was!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made, nice heft - definitely not a cheap plastic thing.  </li>
            <li> and shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Super sparkly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s princess worthy!</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely gorgeous, but the metal is very soft and malleable.  </li>
            <li> more fit my head because it really stuck out on the sides, in saying that, it is easily adjustable!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and sparkly on stage!</li>
            <li> The frame bends very easily but it is very sparkly and very elegant because of the way it curves the head instead of being a straight circumference.</li>
            <li> All the rhinestones were attached securely.</li>
            <li> She is comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> The tiara fit securely even in my niece&#x27;s thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> She admired it for a minute or two and as she put it on, it bent and broke free at the point where the design starts.  </li>
            <li> This was a great present for my daughter.</li>
            <li> the rhinestone is fantastic</li>
            <li> and it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> and you should have seen her face light up</li>
            <li> Also you can bend it to fit</li>
            <li> Easy to stick in hair, easy to get it out, holds well in place and looks pretty!</li>
            <li> Going to be very fun to debut at a Bachelorette party soon</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I requested :)</li>
            <li> and I wanted a tiara that would match my sparkly dress, I originally found one that was $80 and was devastated that I couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Fun piece to hang out with the girls!</li>
            <li> Its so much better than the cheap straight ones and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did its the perfect accessory to add a little more to your big day even if its not a wedding.</li>
            <li> The cutest thing in my room right now!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my grandaughters sweet 16.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter sweet 16</li>
            <li> So if you are looking at buying this for a crown I would definitely recommend it as it is just absolutely gorgeous and sparkles like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> Enough bling and good 4 d price.</li>

            <li> This is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty Tiara.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> As I opened the package I fell more in love with this tiara, I would definitely recommend this tiara to anyone getting married or having a special occasion.</li>
            <li> Simple and elegant!  </li>
            <li> So pretty in person!</li>
            <li> The stones are stunning and crystal clear.</li>
            <li> This is a mature headpiece that can fit a lot of occasions...not like the cheap toy ones.</li>
            <li> it is worth getting....</li>
            <li> This tiara was worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> That alone made every penny worth it.</li>
            <li> They were so much fun.</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I looked for a year to find the right head piece for her wedding</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly, well packaged, and looked very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I feel confident that it&#x27;ll be secure and I won&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off, or sliding and being off center on my head.</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it and thought I spent so much money.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend getting this for someone&#x27;s special day, she will indeed feel like a princess wearing this....</li>
            <li> Very pretty, elegant and delicate but showing from a distance, looks more than the price.</li>
            <li> The plastic package it comes in would not be suitable for long term storage.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it in the picture</li>
            <li> Just the perfect size for not too small and not too big.</li>
            <li> It was really pretty.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and makes you feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am getting married in July</li>
            <li> It was, needless to say, very impressive.  </li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll break it easily.</li>
            <li> BUT I did buy it so I can wear around the apt when my bf is being bitter!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical in making this purchase online, but it shipped fast and it so so beautiful!!</li>
            <li> The Rhinestones are so clear the light really plays off it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks more expensive with a good up-do at a hair salon and its a polish before wearing it would be recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look pretty real.</li>
            <li> This tiara is very sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone who has a special event to attend!</li>
            <li> and it stayed in place easily without extra pinning.  </li>
            <li> It is large.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I anticipated but great quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to rival a Tiffany tiara, of course, but the stones were bright and clear, and the metal held up to stage use for 5 performances with no sign of trouble.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is I think it should of had another comb in the center to secure it better.  </li>
            <li> If this were real gold or silver it would flex just as much.</li>
            <li> Treat gently as you could probably break it if you didn&#x27;t think about it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I really like the look</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for any event!</li>
            <li> She looked like a real princess.</li>
            <li> the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> It almost looked real, meaning real sterling and diamond.</li>
            <li> the shine looks so real...</li>
            <li> I knew she wouldn&#x27;t want to wear anything in her hair for the whole party if it was too cheap-looking, so we wanted to get a nicer-looking one.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly and fast arrival.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are small and that makes it look elegant and sort of classy rather than cheap looking.</li>
            <li> We are all looking forward to wearing them at many other events.</li>
            <li> and it looked fake, but when I received it, I was amazed by how beautiful and real it looked.</li>
            <li> For everyone saying that it feels flimsy or cheap because the metal flexes they are wrong, its got a nice solid weight and the metal is supposed to flex to fit any head size.</li>
            <li> This tiara is well made, very sparkly and of really high quality.  </li>
            <li> The metal frame is delicate but strong, yet flexible to fit a head.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this for my next daughter sweet 16.</li>
            <li> This tiara is just adorable for Princess theme parties/sleepovers or for your little girl to be the center of attention on her very special</li>
            <li> so quickly it was wrapped well enough to protect it from damage</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stand as high off my head as I thought it would but that actually was a better choice if I were going to actually where it.</li>
            <li> Sits about 1.5 inches high, not quite 2 inches.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a high school graduate -</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend placing it on your bucket list.</li>
            <li> Tiara a little lighter and more flimsy than I had hoped,  </li>
            <li> It was such a fun gift for a 12 year old!</li>
            <li> like she won a brand new car.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and it is exactly as it looks in the picture, it just in a very particular way on your head that makes it difficult to hide the side combs in your hair (which is what I wanted).</li>
            <li> This tiara is as beautiful as the expensive ones (without the astronomical price!).</li>
            <li> This tiara is made to be flexible and not stiff.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 13 year old daughter this Christmas.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hurt, but are very flexible to adjust to a smaller head.  </li>
            <li> it was a gift for  a 9  year old.  </li>
            <li> But this one far exceeded expectations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ornate, but not over the top, delicate, but not flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I think if you wanted to wear this as part of a bridal ensemble for your wedding, it would look classy also.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item in early June, it arrived about 3days after my purchase</li>
            <li> Beautiful , very expensive looking.  </li>
            <li> , at first it was a little large for me</li>
            <li> The metal is a little softer/more bendable than I would like, but it is very glamorous abd pretty for the price.</li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty decent quality but nothing you will pass down or have around for years to come</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly in a protective clear round plastic box to store the crown.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> but at the price point I got exactly want I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is different from other tiaras in that it is shaped to sit a little more straight up on maybe the middle of your head.</li>
            <li> My little  girl loves this tiara, she says that she is going to wear it even the day she is going to get married!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for a 15 year old girl</li>
            <li> the band is a little flimsy but it is so sparkly pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived in a very thin clear plastic tupper look-a-like thing but it really didn&#x27;t matter to me since it was something I bought just for fun</li>
            <li> I was worried that I may have bought my wedding tiara late because I got married on the13th.</li>
            <li> but the jams and design lift up so you can see the crown versus at laying flat on your head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shame that I can&#x27;t see it lasting very long.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, I went to iparty and was not impressed with their selection of white pot metal, clunky tiaras, dipped in glue and smothered in glitter; it looked cheap, felt cheap, and if you looked at it the wrong way, it broke.  </li>
            <li> (She has fairly thick, straight hair.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be a treasured memento for a a long time!  </li>
            <li> Purchased for single event but will wear whenever the occasion presents!</li>
            <li> When i ordered it, i was afraid it looks cheap, but it does not.</li>
            <li> my only problem was that by the time I got it out the wrapper one of the combs had broken and we glued it back together as a temporary fix because I didn&#x27;t have enough time to get another one in time from amazon.  </li>
            <li> The piece ended up coming back off before the wedding began but you couldn&#x27;t tell that a comb was missing or anything.</li>
            <li> For the price it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This one will last a few years until she grows out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty scary when you order items online.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s like any other crown  </li>
            <li> Look like a princess when my day comes ladies bride to be and other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I purchased this tiara.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the edges of each socket are not pressed well, so the veil sometimes can be caught on.</li>
            <li> Although the tiara is as described - very sparkly - unfortunately we have to return it.  </li>
            <li> It was even sparkly in the dark room with just the DJ uplighting.</li>
            <li> I wear this while playing bass Coors bottles</li>
            <li> Very pretty but is somewhat painful to wear.</li>
            <li> I got it for my little sister.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t make the mistake of forgetting to pin it to your head a little</li>
            <li> The quality was not cheap either.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it because the stones didn&#x27;t look all that clear</li>
            <li> The tiara stays on your head with a small comb on each side.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work for a small child.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what I would get when I ordered this Tiara.  </li>
            <li> It has two small combs on each side to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> And for the price, it&#x27;s just unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I am about to turn 50 and wanted to be ridiculous and dress as a beauty queen for my birthday.</li>
            <li> and I was a little sad that I didn&#x27;t get myself one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too late!  </li>
            <li> the teeth slide through my thick hair with no snagging!  </li>
            <li> I like that the combs are metal that won&#x27;t get broken or stuck in the hair.  </li>
            <li> they said it made me look like a princess, so don&#x27;t be afraid to get this for a wedding I took the risk</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend who was feeling very sad.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing depending on what you need it for.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive looking!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loved it. Its really good quality and looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was actually going to be a gag gift, but party got canceled and it was never given.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it. Return was easy.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, well packaged, and looked very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment much more as it was never worn.&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you plan on keeping it, you might want to find a box. The plastic package it comes in would not be suitable for long term storage.</li>
            <li> the band is a little flimsy but it is so sparkly pretty. purchased as a gift for my niece, she almost died with excitement. and shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this tiara! When I first saw it in the picture I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it because the stones didn&#x27;t look all that clear and it looked fake, but when I received it, I was amazed by how beautiful and real it looked. The stones are stunning and crystal clear. I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely gorgeous tiara!  It shines brilliantly and does not look cheap in any way.  My daughter was very pleased to wear this for homecoming queen candidate.  I highly recommend this to any one looking for a beautiful tiara at a great price.  Plus, it stayed on her head nicely.</li>
            <li> Arrived in tact and on time.  Tiara a little lighter and more flimsy than I had hoped,  but I think it very good value for money.  I would rather have paid more for a piece that was constructed more robustly, but having said that,  the design is delightful, and  intensely sparkly.  I know my eight-year-old Goddaughter  is going to be thrilled.  It&#x27;s just a shame that I can&#x27;t see it lasting very long.  For the price,  it&#x27;s a gem!</li>
            <li> Very pretty but is somewhat painful to wear.</li>
            <li> Really great product! I used it in a dance performance.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is I think it should of had another comb in the center to secure it better.  It made it through my show perfectly.  I just had to add a lot of extra pins to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece. Shipped quickly in a protective clear round plastic box to store the crown. Not heirloom quality but at the price point I got exactly want I expected.  All the rhinestones were attached securely. I did not have and fall out during my wedding and reception.</li>
            <li> Perfect as accessory for bride&#x27;s vale and as costume add-on. Easy to stick in hair, easy to get it out, holds well in place and looks pretty!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s performance as Clara in the Nutcracker.  This is extremely nice for the price.  It&#x27;s not going to rival a Tiffany tiara, of course, but the stones were bright and clear, and the metal held up to stage use for 5 performances with no sign of trouble.  It&#x27;ll be a treasured memento for a a long time!  It came well-packed to avoid damage in shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this for my... friend.. for her 19th birthday, because she fancies herself a princess, as a teasing joke but man did she act like I bought her a house and gave her a diamond ring! The box it came in is just a tupperware thing so I got one of those display cases for 4 bucks.  For everyone saying that it feels flimsy or cheap because the metal flexes they are wrong, its got a nice solid weight and the metal is supposed to flex to fit any head size. If this were real gold or silver it would flex just as much. Highly recommend getting this for someone&#x27;s special day, she will indeed feel like a princess wearing this.... freaking everywhere.... for the next several weeks...</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly in my friendÂ´s head. THe details and the materials are amazing. She is comfortable with it.Great product.</li>
            <li> absolutely stunning.  I gave this to a friend who was feeling very sad.  It brightened her life and I was a little sad that I didn&#x27;t get myself one.  It&#x27;s not too late!  I think I will.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, shiny and of good quality for the price I paid !</li>
            <li> Like many BTB I wanted to wear a tiara and this one is amazing! I love it so much! Its so much better than the cheap straight ones and the teeth slide through my thick hair with no snagging!  The so called display box is just wrong to say, but it is forgiven because of my love for it.</li>
            <li> It was perfect &amp; exactly what my daughter wanted. Super sparkly!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty tiara, I will be wearing it for my wedding. I love it, and it is exactly as it looks in the picture, it just in a very particular way on your head that makes it difficult to hide the side combs in your hair (which is what I wanted). If you don&#x27;t mind those showing a bit, then it is perfect. It matches my jewelry as well. (: Happy Wedding!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! better than I thought it would be. Sits about 1.5 inches high, not quite 2 inches. Just the perfect size for not too small and not too big. Also a really great price! Similar tiaras at bridal stores are priced at over $100!</li>
            <li> It was really pretty.....the shape of it was the best thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 13 year old daughter this Christmas. She absolutely loved it and was really pleased that it looked so grown-up. This is a mature headpiece that can fit a lot of occasions...not like the cheap toy ones. Mom get&#x27;s a pat on the back for this tiara pick!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I requested :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and makes you feel like a princess. But it&#x27;s not sturdy at all. Very easy to bend so if you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll break it easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my grandaughters sweet 16. She loved it and it matched her  gown perfectly...</li>
            <li> They are all good and exceeded my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> Stunningly beautiful.  Really good quality.</li>
            <li> I wore this for a Halloween costume dance, but it would also be perfect as a wedding tiara. Sparkly as described. The tiara stays on your head with a small comb on each side. I used bobby pins to pin the combs to my head and even with an evening of dancing, the tiara did not budge and was very comfortable (I forgot I was wearing it). I highly recommend this tiara; it is a great value for the money and does not look cheap!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it and wore it for her &amp;#34;Sweet 16&amp;#34; birthday and wished she could wear it every day!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this tiara! Tiara itself and two combs can be adjusted to one&#x27;s head and fit perfectly. All the stones were in their sockets. The only complaint is that the edges of each socket are not pressed well, so the veil sometimes can be caught on.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!! I looked like a princess at my wedding!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a different one and returned it... then found this one&lt;br /&gt;and it was awesome!  Buy it... you won&#x27;t regret it!! :)</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter sweet 16.. looks just like picture, and also great quality. I will be using this for my next daughter sweet 16.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding last week. When i ordered it, i was afraid it looks cheap, but it does not. It looks cute. The rhinestones are small and that makes it look elegant and sort of classy rather than cheap looking. For the money, it is great. The only thing i have about it is you will need to use headpins to keep it in place. I tried it without headpins and it was not sturdy. It moved so i used a headpin. My guests thought it was very cute looking. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered two different tiara&#x27;s and this one is the best with my veil, if you want to look like a princess then pick this.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my upcoming wedding on the 26th. I was a bit skeptical in making this purchase online, but it shipped fast and it so so beautiful!! It looks stunning on, and sits well on my head. I feel confident that it&#x27;ll be secure and I won&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off, or sliding and being off center on my head. For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone who has a special event to attend! I would buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> it looks nice and cheap, i didnt expect it to be of this quality. I got it for my little sister.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, elegant and delicate but showing from a distance, looks more than the price. Perfect on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Love the crown but my only problem was that by the time I got it out the wrapper one of the combs had broken and we glued it back together as a temporary fix because I didn&#x27;t have enough time to get another one in time from amazon.  The piece ended up coming back off before the wedding began but you couldn&#x27;t tell that a comb was missing or anything. It is very beautiful though.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and sparkly on stage! The metal is a little softer/more bendable than I would like, but it is very glamorous abd pretty for the price.</li>
            <li> Had been on a getaway with some woman friends, and one member brought  tiara as a gag, which was a big hit! I thought I&#x27;d get this as a gag gift for another gathering, and it was so lovely that I got another!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece to wear at her bachelorette party.  The tiara fit securely even in my niece&#x27;s thinner hair.  The tiara is definitely pageant-quality.</li>
            <li> The latest thing for evening wear. I wear this while playing bass Coors bottles (Empty)..*burp* proving the back beat for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For The Ho Downers Bottle Band.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted !!  Beautiful and Very sparkly. Easily bends to fit my head. I don&#x27;t think it would work for a small child. Lovely design. Treat gently as you could probably break it if you didn&#x27;t think about it.</li>
            <li> Nice product and fully met the needs it was purchased for.  Item is attractive and can be used for more than one use</li>
            <li> Came super fast. Very cute and sparkely. I will be wearing it on my wedding day in may and cannot wait!</li>
            <li> My wife loves wearing this grocery shopping. It makes her remember who she is to us. It also keeps her hair back.</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I looked for a year to find the right head piece for her wedding and this one is the best by far. The Rhinestones are so clear the light really plays off it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Its beautiful</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this Tiara ordered it to wear on my wedding day. It was packaged very well and shipping was great. I must say that it sparkles and looks like it cost a lot more it is worth getting....</li>
            <li> Beautiful and perfect for my son to give to his Prom date!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making me a princess.  I wore this on my wedding and it was stunning! Very expensive looking!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what I would get when I ordered this Tiara.  It&#x27;s pretty scary when you order items online. It could really really good but then you receive it well you know how that goes.  I was completely surprised and impressed at how pretty the tiara was. I loved the fact that it had combs at the end so it didn&#x27;t slip. Another feature I liked was that it was flexible. For the price it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is so, so cute.  It is nice quality.  It is different from other tiaras in that it is shaped to sit a little more straight up on maybe the middle of your head. I like that the combs are metal that won&#x27;t get broken or stuck in the hair.  They don&#x27;t hurt, but are very flexible to adjust to a smaller head.  Can&#x27;t wait to give to my girls for christmas!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and arrived on time</li>
            <li> True story! Ok, sooo maybe im alittle bit silly.. no I didn&#x27;t buy this crown for any pageants or anything like that. BUT I did buy it so I can wear around the apt when my bf is being bitter! And believe ME he cannot stay bitter when he looks at me with this beautiful crown on! Hehe! What woman doesn&#x27;t want to feel like a queen right? ;) I must say I was taken back by how beautiful this was! It is truly amazing for the price! It sparkles like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  So if you are looking at buying this for a crown I would definitely recommend it as it is just absolutely gorgeous and sparkles like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Trust me on this one!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! So amazing I&#x27;m wearing it for my wedding!</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot for its sparkle but its made of cheap material that bends which i dont like! I wish it was made more of a sturdy material. But hey it lasted for my Wedding Day and it didn&#x27;t break. But over all I DO recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super cute!  Bought for my niece to wear to a celebration of her 16th birthday, and she loved it. :-)</li>
            <li> The picture of it is beautiful. The actual tiara is just stunning!!!! It exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s sturdy unlike the flimsy ones you get else where. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made, nice heft - definitely not a cheap plastic thing.  My daughter wanted to be a princess for her senior prom this year and wearing a tiara was on her wish list.  This was beautiful and her eyes lit up when she saw it.  She was a beautiful princess on her big night.</li>
            <li> Although the tiara is as described - very sparkly - unfortunately we have to return it.  it was a gift for  a 9  year old.  She admired it for a minute or two and as she put it on, it bent and broke free at the point where the design starts.  Seems to have been a manufacturing defect.  It will be returned thiis week..</li>
            <li> What can I say. This was a great present for my daughter. They look pretty real. Good choice over those cheaper ones. This one will last a few years until she grows out of it.</li>
            <li> Nice&lt;br /&gt;sparkly&lt;br /&gt;Works well with all types of hairstyles&lt;br /&gt;I used this for birthday in Vegas and got lots of attention.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a high school graduate - she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wedding to go with the veil. Beautiful , very expensive looking.  Very happy about the price!</li>
            <li> Just love it. Enough bling and good 4 d price. Bought one @ one of the major bridal stores 4 a lot more then returned it! I will b wearing it 4 my wedding in Ã²ctober.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter for Elsa costume--she is in love!</li>
            <li> Beyond beautiful! ! This piece looks amazing and is a great value for it&#x27;s price. Going to look so elegant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for her bday.  She absolutely loved it and thought I spent so much money.  This is beautiful and a good deal.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful crown however it&#x27;s like any other crown  it&#x27;s very flimsy. But it&#x27;s one of the best crown I&#x27;ve seen I love the design because it fits flat on your head but the jams and design lift up so you can see the crown versus at laying flat on your head</li>
            <li> Used this for a castle/princess themed bridal shower. It adjusted easily and did not fall off.</li>
            <li> the rhinestone is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;as it shown in the picture&lt;br /&gt;may be better&lt;br /&gt;yeah I didnt like the length&lt;br /&gt;but I will wear it for my wedding&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was absolutely beautiful. I wore it for my quinceanera and it looked fantastic. A very good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my daughter&#x27;s Sweet 16. It&#x27;s a nice weight, solid and sparkles beautifully. My daughter looked beautiful in it. It was even sparkly in the dark room with just the DJ uplighting. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> This tiara was worth the money. Great quality, good shine, and comfortable fit. Perfect choice for a wedding or any other occasion calling for a tiara!</li>
            <li> Very happy. This was a great price and a great product.</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely gorgeous, but the metal is very soft and malleable.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing depending on what you need it for.  If it&#x27;s just for pictures or a one time event, get it.  If you are hoping to have a sturdy piece for costume play, perhaps find something else.  It easily forms to you head shape, but can just as easily be bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! I am wearing this on my wedding day and am so happy with the quality and appearance!</li>
            <li> Appeared to be excellent qaulity for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sparkly tiara. Good price</li>
            <li> The most beautiful of them all!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great Tiara, but it is does bend quite easily. I really like the look and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter, daughter and I fought over this at Christmas, lol.  It was such a fun gift for a 12 year old!</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely gorgeous! Perfect height and quality! I would highly recommend it for any event! Its so beautiful!</li>
            <li> just as pictured, beautiful</li>
            <li> Eh this was nice but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for your wedding. I got it and settled, just shell out more cash and get a nice one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to say this isn&#x27;t nice, its just not that nice.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty. Good quality too. I like it</li>
            <li> This tiara is well made, very sparkly and of really high quality.  It fits an adult and the packaging was great too</li>
            <li> I  bought for my daughter&#x27;s 13th birthday and she loves it.She looked like a real princess. Pleasure doing business with you.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in July and I wanted a tiara that would match my sparkly dress, I originally found one that was $80 and was devastated that I couldn&#x27;t afford it. While browsing amazon I came across this Tiara and fell in love, after reading some reviews on it I decided I wanted to purchase it. I ordered it on June 7th and I received today June 13th, so the shipping was really fast. As I opened the package I fell more in love with this tiara, I would definitely recommend this tiara to anyone getting married or having a special occasion. The pictures do not do it any justice. It is beautiful and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all. I am truly AMAZED with this purchase and would do business with this company again. :D</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for a 15 year old girl and you should have seen her face light up like she won a brand new car.  No joke.  It was incredibly sparkly, way more than anticipated, especially when the light bounced off the crystals.  The quality was not cheap either.  The metal frame is delicate but strong, yet flexible to fit a head.  The crystals were all in place and none had fallen out.  There were sooo many crystals in it, shimmering like a disco ball.  It was, needless to say, very impressive.  In comparison, I went to iparty and was not impressed with their selection of white pot metal, clunky tiaras, dipped in glue and smothered in glitter; it looked cheap, felt cheap, and if you looked at it the wrong way, it broke.  But this one far exceeded expectations.  I did what you are doing, reading reviews, figuring out which product is the best bang for the buck, and this one seemed to have great reviews, but let me tell you, there was no review that could compare to the expression on that little girl&#x27;s face and the joy that it brought to her.  That alone made every penny worth it.</li>
            <li> As far as Tiaras go, this was beautiful. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair. I am about to turn 50 and wanted to be ridiculous and dress as a beauty queen for my birthday. Since gave up the idea and sent this back but figured I would rate it anyway. It really is beautiful and very sparkly. Didn&#x27;t stand as high off my head as I thought it would but that actually was a better choice if I were going to actually where it. It almost looked real, meaning real sterling and diamond. Definitely not a kid&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom to wear for her 60th birthday celebration.  This piece was beautiful and bright.  It looked lovely on her and STAYED in place without being uncomfortable.  She didn&#x27;t take it off all evening!  When she finally did take it off, it was not all tangled in her hair.  (She has fairly thick, straight hair.)  She will keep it for years to come.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Grandma said, &amp;#34;All I want for my birthday is a tiara.&amp;#34;  How could I say no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one, and it is BEAUTIFUL.  I love that it tilts upward, so it can be worn comfortably.  All the stones are in place, and it is shiny and sparkly all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for the packaging - I had to buy a nice gift box separately.  This one looks like a deli container.</li>
            <li> I love this tiara and will be wearing it for my wedding.  It is so sparkly and beautiful.  Very nice quality, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  Also you can bend it to fit, at first it was a little large for me but I adjusted the sides.  The combs help keep it in place.</li>
            <li> The cutest thing in my room right now! Worth the buy! It&#x27;s princess worthy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  She is going to look like a princess in her quinceaÃ±era party.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding in June &amp; it is beyond beautiful..I will be the belle of the balle.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I anticipated but great quality. It sparkled beautifully and curved perfectly to fit my mom&#x27;s head. It was delivered within a day of me buying it. Great product and service.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the guest of honor at a 60th birthday party. The tiara is so beautiful the picture does not do it justice. It was one of the highlights of the party. I then purchased a different style for all the female guests to set the guest of honor apart. They were so much fun. I don&#x27;t know how many women in their lifetime ever where a tiara but I highly recommend placing it on your bucket list. We are all looking forward to wearing them at many other events. This tiara is stunning, well made and affordable. It comes in a container to store it.</li>
            <li> This tiara is very sparkly and pretty. It is very bendable and not the best quality but will look good in pictures. It is large.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made. Cant wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> Much more sparkly than I had anticipated, it is very sturdy with a good comfort fit. Going to be very fun to debut at a Bachelorette party soon</li>
            <li> Its beautiful my daughter was so happy</li>
            <li> Came in time and loveded it no problems at all. Was exactly as described however this products combs break easily when you try to wear it</li>
            <li> This is pretty nice, acceptable quality that can save you lots over the bridal store.</li>
            <li> The size was a bit short was a bit disappointed.once again I kept it .came on time and good .I will. Look like a princess when my day comes ladies bride to be and other&#x27;s. Get it you won&#x27;t regret ......CD</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I did have to bend the metal to more fit my head because it really stuck out on the sides, in saying that, it is easily adjustable!</li>
            <li> Great for my great grand daughter she loved it all sparkly and princess  she wears it all day and we have to take it off for bath time</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I purchased this tiara. When I recieved this I was amazed. This tiara was simply stunning. It shines so beautifully in the light.</li>
            <li> Such a gorgeous and well constructed tiara! I got it for my cousin&#x27;s graduation party at a fancy banquet hall. It sparkled and radiated so beautifully! She loved it so much! She looked gorgeous in it, and it matched her outfit and the venue perfectly! And for the price, it&#x27;s just unbelievable! I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Tiara was beautiful-just like picture</li>
            <li> Simple and elegant!  It&#x27;s a great accessory that goes perfect with my dress.  It has good quality and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> My little  girl loves this tiara, she says that she is going to wear it even the day she is going to get married!</li>
            <li> The woman I brought this for was thrilled.It was her 6th BD.</li>
            <li> Very pretty Tiara. Goes great with my daughter&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen. It has so much sparkle to it and the price was good. The fit was very comfortable. This tiara is made to be flexible and not stiff.</li>
            <li> The frame bends very easily but it is very sparkly and very elegant because of the way it curves the head instead of being a straight circumference.</li>
            <li> Beautiful in person!! Just as pictured! Love it!</li>
            <li> very beautiful love the shine looks so real... i was able to adjust it to the size of the head, flexable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, more than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;It looked beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> Even more beautiful in person.  Love it. I am wearing this in my wedding.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter to wear on her birthday.  She Loved it!  It&#x27;s ornate, but not over the top, delicate, but not flimsy.  For the price, this is a class act.  You are not getting something you would find in the toy or party aisle of a store.</li>
            <li> BLING BLING!!! I absolutely love my tiara!!!!! It&#x27;s gorgeous and so sparkly! The picture doesn&#x27;t to this tiara justice.  I cannot wait to wear this for my wedding in July! Thank you!</li>
            <li> All the rhinestones were in place securely packed and it fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to wear for a bridal shower her sister was giving...because when else can one get away with wearing a crystal tiara?  I knew she wouldn&#x27;t want to wear anything in her hair for the whole party if it was too cheap-looking, so we wanted to get a nicer-looking one. This tiara exceeded expectations. It is just lovely, and very well made.  It has two small combs on each side to hold it in place.  My daughter has very fine hair and it stayed in place easily without extra pinning.  I think if you wanted to wear this as part of a bridal ensemble for your wedding, it would look classy also.  It is very brilliant.  She wore it happily at the party and she plans to keep it to wear for a New-Year&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li> I have looked at a number of tiaras at bridal shops that were $150 or more.  This tiara is as beautiful as the expensive ones (without the astronomical price!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in early June, it arrived about 3days after my purchase it came in the mail so quickly it was wrapped well enough to protect it from damage I was worried that I may have bought my wedding tiara late because I got married on the13th. When I put it on it was the perfect size even though I have a big head lol it wasn&#x27;t huge either. It is so sparkly and when my guest saw me they all loved my dress Ofcourse but I got a lot of complements on my tiara they said it made me look like a princess, so don&#x27;t be afraid to get this for a wedding I took the risk and I&#x27;m glad I did its the perfect accessory to add a little more to your big day even if its not a wedding. And also if you are gonna be dancing and if your partner will lean you back to kiss you don&#x27;t make the mistake of forgetting to pin it to your head a little so it won&#x27;t start to fall back lol but overall this tiara is beautiful and very comfortable t won&#x27;t get stuck on your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just beautiful. The crystal sparkles as though it were made of diamonds. I felt like a princess when i put it on. My best friends all said that I looked the part of royalty. I look forward to wearing this on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> So pretty in person! Purchased for single event but will wear whenever the occasion presents! Fun piece to hang out with the girls!</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfect size. Very sparkly and fast arrival. Would buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> This was great for my halloween costume.  It looks so real and great price.</li>
            <li> Really pretty and perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I wore this for my wedding last week for my wedding.  My groom loved it. I got a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece!! Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This tiara is just adorable for Princess theme parties/sleepovers or for your little girl to be the center of attention on her very special day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty decent quality but nothing you will pass down or have around for years to come but it will definitely sparkle and do the job for when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks more expensive with a good up-do at a hair salon and its a polish before wearing it would be recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a very thin clear plastic tupper look-a-like thing but it really didn&#x27;t matter to me since it was something I bought just for fun and I could store however I wanted any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and buy it again..:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely stunning in person, my daughter love&#x27;s it.</li>
