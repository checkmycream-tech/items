            <li>I give this product 4 stars because it is almost perfect!</li>
            <li>, decided to get it, and im very happy i did.</li>
            <li>This lip gloss is the perfect nude color.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>The color is probably .00001 darker in person, but it still is beautiful.</li>
            <li>and it stays great.</li>
            <li>Great color..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great nude shade.</li>
            <li>Very nice with the crayon shape.</li>
            <li>The gloss is quite pleasant for the lips, I&#x60;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>Not even a good lip balm and no hint of nude color.  </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and lasts a fair amount of time on lips.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, too.</li>
            <li>Great gloss, applies easily but also comes off easily---that can be said for any gloss though!</li>
            <li>The color is very bright, think light khaki with a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>While applying  the lips looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, as well as the price was ($2).</li>
            <li>My lips look so nice with it</li>
            <li>and the gloss goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It is not the kind of gloss that is sticky.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks very nice on.</li>
            <li>The color of this lipstick is not a color I am able to describe.</li>
            <li>The color almost coincide with the color of the skin, but more transparent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still playing around with different applications, and makeup looks to find what works best for me.</li>
            <li>Like the matte nude color of the lip gloss stick, It actually more like lip stick than lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I would buy the product again just not this color - something darker is better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you exfoliate your lips well, or this will sink into the cracks in your lips.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips more than 10 minutes and is full with not so healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>I tend to wear matte, nude colors and this stick adds a lovely light gloss that make my lips look fuller.  </li>
            <li>Easy to toss in your purse and apply without a mirror.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to get this and after using she said she would not purchase again because it felt like cheap quality and not what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>Not too pink not too brown or orange just a great nude color with a bit of a lip gloss over</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f. products so much..</li>
            <li>Very smooth, but not thick...</li>
            <li>therefore I didn&#x27;t want the super colored lips...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a super glittery pinky-bronze color.</li>
            <li>This particular shade is probably better suited for evening/night.</li>
            <li>Coverage is light, and pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just can&#x27;t put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>It WILL transfer rather easily at first, but that color!</li>
            <li>This is a fun lip crayon.</li>
            <li>Feels like chap stick when first put on.</li>
            <li>I bought a darker color at the same time and love that one and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this color its not to dark or to light</li>
            <li>It even areived 4 days early!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>without too much color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I love all of the other face/eye Elf products, but not this lip product</li>
            <li>Pasty, greasy lip product..it ruins my top colour over product &amp; makes lipstick run of my lips.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to explain but its thin and doesnt cover your lips completely, its a sheer kind of color I guess, but still really really good!!!</li>
            <li>because I&#x60;d prefer it to be a little bit more moistening.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for just a normal nude lipstick color</li>
            <li>I am around a caramel color and I have a very dark upper lip which, in my opinion, does not compliment my skin nicely and looks unflattering.</li>
            <li>My local Walmart just started carrying e.l.f. products, and this is the first thing I picked up.</li>
            <li>It is no where near a gloss!</li>
            <li>A bit like Dr. Pepper with a slight hint of mint (odd, yes, but not unpleasant or strong).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really thought I could pull it off, since my natural lip colour is pretty vibrant.</li>
            <li>I like the color, but as much as I love glitter, it&#x27;s a little much for everyday use-</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at a Nude lip colour (Bought a few months ago).  </li>

            <li> If I want to wear a nude I usually have to use a nude eye shadow primer on my lips, and then lipstick.</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best nude I&#x27;ve ever owned.. My local Walmart just started carrying e.l.f. products, and this is the first thing I picked up. I bought it in nude for $2. Feels like chap stick when first put on. It WILL transfer rather easily at first, but that color! I have naturally really red lips. If I want to wear a nude I usually have to use a nude eye shadow primer on my lips, and then lipstick. This stuff is the real deal. I love e.l.f. products so much.. I seriously found this product and wrote this review because I think the world needs to know that this brand is worth what it costs X10.</li>
            <li> Not too pink not too brown or orange just a great nude color with a bit of a lip gloss over and it stays great.</li>
            <li> Was not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Pasty, greasy lip product..it ruins my top colour over product &amp; makes lipstick run of my lips.  I love all of the other face/eye Elf products, but not this lip product</li>
            <li> The color for me is not right. Also it looks thick and pasty, if you have try lips ut really shows and flakes off.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it is almost perfect! The color is probably .00001 darker in person, but it still is beautiful. I absolutely love it! I have an olive skin tone and I have been looking for just a normal nude lipstick color and I found this, decided to get it, and im very happy i did. It even areived 4 days early!!!! Shipping took two days! Anyways, the only flaw is that its is.... Its hard to explain but its thin and doesnt cover your lips completely, its a sheer kind of color I guess, but still really really good!!!</li>
            <li> Great color.. just wished the dang color would stay on.. I guess for the price you get what you get but man! Why can&#x27;t it stay on atleast for 30min!</li>
            <li> The color is nice, as well as the price was ($2). But it doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips more than 10 minutes and is full with not so healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very sheer product.... only seems to moisten the lips...without too much color.&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Nude...therefore I didn&#x27;t want the super colored lips...</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick is not a color I am able to describe. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Useless.  Not even a good lip balm and no hint of nude color.  Will never use.</li>
            <li> The gloss is quite pleasant for the lips, I&#x60;d recommend it. The color almost coincide with the color of the skin, but more transparent. Not the highest grade because I&#x60;d prefer it to be a little bit more moistening.</li>
            <li> This is a fun lip crayon. The color I got was Summer Nights and it&#x27;s a super glittery pinky-bronze color. I like the color, but as much as I love glitter, it&#x27;s a little much for everyday use- even for me! This particular shade is probably better suited for evening/night. It is moisturizing and lasts a fair amount of time on lips. I can&#x27;t quite figure out the smell though. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just can&#x27;t put my finger on it. A bit like Dr. Pepper with a slight hint of mint (odd, yes, but not unpleasant or strong). Easy to toss in your purse and apply without a mirror. I&#x27;d definitely try other colors!</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at a Nude lip colour (Bought a few months ago).  I&#x27;ve never really thought I could pull it off, since my natural lip colour is pretty vibrant. I found this to be a bit Rusty coloured on my lips, and noticed it was almost too creamy. Every time I rubbed my lips together, it would just smear the lipstick to the edge of my lips, making me look like I lined them but forgot to fill them haha. I&#x27;m still playing around with different applications, and makeup looks to find what works best for me.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, but not thick...I like it.</li>
            <li> Great gloss, applies easily but also comes off easily---that can be said for any gloss though!</li>
            <li> Very nice with the crayon shape. It is totally matt, no gloss at all if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Like the matte nude color of the lip gloss stick, It actually more like lip stick than lip gloss.While applying  the lips looks amazing. Unfortunately the color lasts for a very short time on the lips, and then just loose its texture after 20-30 min and looks not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to get this and after using she said she would not purchase again because it felt like cheap quality and not what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is not sticky and the color stays for a fairly long time. The color is very bright, think light khaki with a bit of shimmer. I bought a darker color at the same time and love that one and use it all the time. I would buy the product again just not this color - something darker is better.</li>
            <li> It is no where near a gloss! I would have thought it was concealer if I didn&#x27;t know it was lip gloss!</li>
            <li> I tend to wear matte, nude colors and this stick adds a lovely light gloss that make my lips look fuller.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have this in the shade In the Nude and it&#x27;s a great nude shade. It goes on smoothly and looks very nice on. It twists up so no need for sharpening. Good product!</li>
            <li> I love this color its not to dark or to light</li>
            <li> I am around a caramel color and I have a very dark upper lip which, in my opinion, does not compliment my skin nicely and looks unflattering. With this nude lip gloss, I can make my lips into a lighter color to go with my skin tone! My lips look so nice with it and the gloss goes on nicely. Good coverage, too.</li>
            <li> It was everything I was expecting!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is the perfect nude color. It is not the kind of gloss that is sticky. It last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has almost a minty scent to it, I like it. Coverage is light, and pretty. Just make sure you exfoliate your lips well, or this will sink into the cracks in your lips.</li>
