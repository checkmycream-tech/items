            <li>Forgiving if you make a mistake, but require perfect technique if you want a completely smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good razor and a good value.</li>
            <li>Good for 3-4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for about 3 weeks now and have gotten good performance from them.</li>
            <li>good shaves from each blade</li>
            <li>All in all, a good purchase; this is something that I would (and probably will) buy again.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of irritation and weeping despite good prep and technique.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Good blades for entry into world of double-edged shaving.  </li>
            <li>but these are good value.</li>
            <li>Its a good deal for a lot of razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These &#x27;Derby&#x27; blades are good for me for 3 shaves before they start to pull, meaning they need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>That is really good value since that is all I get from a Feather too</li>
            <li>Good blades for a good price.</li>
            <li>A perfect smooth shave with the feel of hair being cut rather than torn.</li>
            <li>I change the blade about every 5th shave, so this box should be good for about 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a good razor to hold them.  </li>
            <li>I have a Parker, but I hear Merkur is good too.</li>
            <li>It still makes me feel good.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price</li>
            <li>They are not my favorites but they give a good shave..</li>
            <li>Good value if they work for you.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said this was a good deal</li>
            <li>Good - they&#x27;re good for 4-5 shaves before they start to tug.</li>
            <li>with all things shaving, YMMV, so you probably don&#x27;t want to make the rookie move I did and purchase 100 of these guys unless you know they&#x27;re good for your face.  </li>
            <li>and I get a really good even shave</li>
            <li>I used it with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and loved the combination.</li>
            <li>they are good like they say.</li>
            <li>I bought the multi pack and this seemed to be the best fit for my face.  </li>
            <li>so I am good for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>It was a wonderful, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are good for shaving against the grain which i prefer for the closer shave.</li>
            <li>Good investment.</li>
            <li>The cost of the blades alone is a good reason to try them out to seeif you like them.</li>
            <li>For blades in quantity, I still lean toward the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li>At this time it is great that there is another option than the cartridge style razors that are so popular with the kids.  </li>
            <li>I loved the price these Derby blades sold for, but upon arrival, I pulled one out and attempted to shave.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>and/or have not mastered making a good lather with a brush</li>
            <li>Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a good deal, an I recommend  it to get.  SW</li>
            <li>These razor blades are just as good as the ones you would purchase from any store.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product and</li>
            <li>good blade for the money.</li>
            <li>Good box size</li>
            <li>I get 4 shaves out of each blade, so durability is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>i get about 4 shaves out of 1 blade, good product for the price.......</li>
            <li>i will def buy them again good deal.</li>
            <li>For the price, these are good blades.  </li>
            <li>I get a consistently good shave with these blades.</li>
            <li>blade good for newbies</li>
            <li>for the price still Damm good.</li>
            <li>came across a wise internet post about how the sharpest of razors is NOT what us with...</li>
            <li>It is a vastly superior shave to cartridges or an electric.  </li>
            <li>This is a good deal, what did I pay?</li>
            <li>Good quality and price</li>
            <li>It took a month to eventually use the Merkur and it was still good when I replaced it just to try these</li>
            <li>the price is still good</li>
            <li>That said, this is a lot of blades for a really good price.</li>
            <li>7 or 8 good shaves from one blade...</li>
            <li>I wish I knew what the heck happened between 2009 and 2013, but it wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Fair price, and numbered</li>
            <li>When I tried them with my feather razor, they results were not as good.  </li>
            <li>The price point for the quality /quantity is dang good though.</li>
            <li>These Derby blades provide a good shave without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>These are excellent blades for me and my beard, and should be an excellent choice for anyone experienced or newto double edge shaving.   </li>
            <li>Save your money for something else, like good beer.</li>
            <li>Good price per amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several&lt;br /&gt;brands, &amp; find Derby to offer superior performance without having to hock</li>
            <li>blades are of excellent construction, giving smooth, close shaves, without&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I think they are a good value</li>
            <li>The Derby blades seem to be good for 3 to 4 shaves then I&#x27;m looking to replace them.</li>
            <li>These are a really good deal.</li>
            <li>but honestly they work great for me.  </li>
            <li>While not the best, they are cheap and a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Clean packaging, and well its perfect</li>
            <li>Best shave is just after hot shower, but I soap up and shave 5 days of the week and get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to:&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has a safety razor who is looking to stock up on some blades; this was truly an exceptional value.</li>
            <li>They work great for him and are the most affordable option we have come across.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with these blades.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great razors and the cost is even better.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results using these blades along with a Merkur Futur set on 3. BBS with 3 passes and 4-5 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>Great price for so many blades</li>
            <li>There are better blades out there but for the price, these work great.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the price as well :)</li>
            <li>Okay but Astra&#x27;s win my vote.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li>great prices, along with top flight deliveries &amp; customer/consumer services.</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;m nice and the price was good, will be returning them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good shave that is durable and tug free for a great price.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love these blades and the savings!</li>
            <li>and you sure won&#x27;t run out anytime soon!</li>
            <li>Now go pick your favorite razor and get started!</li>
            <li>Will not be buying more!</li>
            <li>I do not think you can get a better deal out there anywhere !</li>
            <li>I love de shaving!</li>
            <li>My husband and son love these blades !</li>
            <li>First off, I will say that these blades were not the best choice for me.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get 100 of them because double-edged blades aren&#x27;t that easy to find in stores anymore</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so affordable and yet give you a way more pleasant (and frankly, closer) shave than cartridges.</li>
            <li>I have gone through about 8 of these blades (two months worth of shaving) and they don&#x27;t give a very good shave and tend to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>razors are very good and definitely worth money.</li>
            <li>Shave is amazing  </li>
            <li>Probably work great for someone with a light beard.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re literally amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing razors to go with my husband&#x27;s shaving kit.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are also an amazing value.</li>
            <li>gave it 5 stars great buy, alot of blades for a cheap price and they get the job done&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>and I have to say that that the handle is amazing, but the Derby blades are lacking.</li>
            <li>Great price for blades, they are smooth.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing value.  </li>
            <li>Have received great, comfortable shaves with these blades.</li>
            <li>What a great smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>good blades--I love i</li>
            <li>Excellent blades and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>come in a nice hanging dispensing box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great blades!</li>
            <li>Thanks Derby you are awesome!</li>
            <li>These blades perform as intended and provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>I just began safety razor shaving and am loving it.</li>
            <li>Great blades, very reliable and at a great price</li>
            <li>I have tried all the blades from the pack, plus others I bought on my own.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely and leaves you with a manly smell.</li>
            <li>These blades give for a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that some companies still make a quality affordable product.  </li>
            <li>so i bought these for my husbands Ambroley Razor (which he loves) but found my own use for them as well-</li>
            <li>Go buy a nice bottle of scotch with the $ you save.</li>
            <li>the box contains mini-boxes of five razors, each razor wrapped in its own paper envelope and then again with wax paper held by some kind of tacky stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice blades that get the job done.</li>
            <li>to each his own.</li>
            <li>nice shaves.</li>
            <li>A nice shaving cream and brush help out too.  </li>
            <li>I own at this point</li>
            <li>It was actually nice not to shave</li>
            <li>I am telling you that the shave is nice and</li>
            <li>My safety razor came with Derby&#x27;s and I liked them.  </li>
            <li>You will get a nice shave with Derby and it won&#x27;t cut you all to hell.</li>
            <li>Then, when you are done, apply some nice Pinaud after shave and you are off in style..</li>
            <li>Its great clean feeling after shaving with Derby products.</li>
            <li>Though Astra, Crystal, Wilkinson, and US Personna are my top choices, the Derby is more than adequate, and considering price, tends toward the excellent category.</li>
            <li>A very good reasonably priced product, which allows me to change blades about once a week for $.50!</li>
            <li>Excellent blades, inexpensive but high in quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this blade and when the time comes to order more</li>
            <li>they are super flexible and were great to take a mark from painters</li>
            <li>If you have thicker growth, it may snag some and lose its edge quickly although I may have experienced that</li>
            <li>By far the best blade!</li>
            <li>good, cheap close shave ..</li>
            <li>Wow, these blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my greatest money saving product i purchased on amazon along with Merkur Model 180</li>
            <li>these blades are great for beginners, I rarely cut myself and when I did it was because I was pushing the razor instead of letting the weight of the razor do all the work.</li>
            <li>The Derby&#x27;s are BY FAR the best blades for MY face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to start using my dad&#x27;s old razor but its not in the best of shape.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and these blades did an awesome job.</li>
            <li>nowadays - things that sound like a good idea</li>
            <li>Good close shave and dirt cheap</li>
            <li>100 razors is kind of a lot, but they don&#x27;t expire, and I&#x27;ll need them for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased them and, for such a good price, they are excellent.</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s old razor works best for shaving</li>
            <li>sure is nice never to pay the for those costly cartridges anymore.</li>
            <li>With this you get 100 Good quality razors that work fantastic for a beginner.</li>
            <li>If you want a good blade in the mid-range of aggressiveness and at a pretty good price, this is your blade.  </li>
            <li>All that said, I think these are pretty good blades and the packaging is good.</li>
            <li>Really nice, smooth, wonderful feeling shave and for super cheap.</li>
            <li>This razor is very comfortable and offers me an excellent /comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they honestly have a better edge than the Dorco blades and provide a better quality shave.</li>
            <li>Great price, does the job, but not as well as I would have imagined as a first timer.</li>
            <li>This is the first blade I have ever tried, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Derby blades for a year now, and they do a great job of shaving; you don&#x27;t feel like you are scraping and pulling hair at all; instead it is a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li>Over all i was most satisfied with these blades for a good smooth shave, over all the most bang for the buck that i have tried.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was so impressed at how inexpensive these are and what a great value this is compared to the normal multi blades I have grown up with.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for beginners or those that don&#x27;t have much patience and like a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Good product, inexpensive and shipped quickly - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Very smooth and forgiving blade that gives a nice close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Ok, but not in the top three.</li>
            <li>Gives a much better shave than the disposable razors I have used for decades....</li>
            <li>When I remember from my youth many years ago is sliding them out of the container one by one into the razor.</li>
            <li>What I realized, was that sharper does not equate to a better shave.  </li>
            <li>But for the price, I can buy more.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPOINTED, WITH ANYTHING THEN THIS</li>
            <li>buy Derby, love shaving</li>
            <li>but I hear that is what most people end up doing.  </li>
            <li>Recommend the Derby blades for every day, safe, shaving;</li>
            <li>what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>There are many choices out there for DE blades</li>
            <li>Could go more that 5 shaves per blade but at 12cents a week why push it.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than Derby.</li>
            <li>Feather is much better and the blade is sharpened to a more refined finish.</li>
            <li>And because of that, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the number of shaves on a blade, but will replace it more often, and thus eliminating the dreaded razor burn and/or</li>
            <li>Planing to buy more.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>A WAY BETTER ROUTE TO GO</li>
            <li>so go with the much better options out there...</li>
            <li>I took a chance with this blade because I had try so many others that were not working well.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and is such a great value!</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>They label these 1234 for each edge, top and bottom (one side 1 and 2/flip side 3 and 4), so you can wear it out evenly.</li>
            <li>For my money it doesn&#x27;t get better than Derby blades.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my double edge razor.</li>
            <li>I love the close cut it provides.</li>
            <li>I thought sharper was better in a bald</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy just one and NOT SUBSCRIBE, otherwise they&#x27;ll keep sending you one every couple of months.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my &amp;#34;Merkur 180&amp;#34; razor and am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of those two factors, I like these blades and will be getting more.</li>
            <li>and I was always satisfied,</li>
            <li>These are good, packaged in convenient 5-blade dispensers, which will be useful when traveling.</li>
            <li>I think I like the Personna blades better, though.</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite blades for my DE.</li>
            <li>A smooth shave and the price won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li>I love the Derby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>4 times I am sure but</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more need be said?</li>
            <li>, I think these are nearly the perfect blade, being very forgiving with a good quality lather.</li>
            <li>all the blades tried, this one landed at the top of the heap so we bought a box.</li>
            <li>People love Astra razors.</li>
            <li>After 3 shaves a butter knife would work better......................</li>
            <li>These are just ok.</li>
            <li>I can get three weeks and some time more per blade ,</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve saved many dollars over the throw away razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be Derby.</li>
            <li>Cuts nice and smooth in almost any DE razor.  </li>
            <li>I think I bought them 3 years ago, maybe more</li>
            <li>Make sure that you use a preshave routine with these razors.</li>
            <li>I got an ok shave with this</li>
            <li>but I also wanted a nice and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>There are almost as many types of blades as there are faces.  </li>
            <li>You would be best off starting with a sample pack, and go from there.  </li>
            <li>These work great with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Love the shave.  </li>
            <li>Love the # of</li>
            <li>Love the # of blades in the box.</li>
            <li>I started shaving with this blade back in April and was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better quality blades out there, but I won&#x27;t know for another .. 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, safety shaving works best with two passes in opposite directions.  </li>
            <li>BETTER THAN WALMART</li>
            <li>In addition, I get more shaves per blade with the Derby&#x27;s than I do with some others I use.</li>
            <li>so are many of clothes.  </li>
            <li>These blades are okay, they’re better than The Shark brand that came with my razor though.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.  </li>
            <li>Have only used one for 4 shaves and is excellent in both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought the 100 count because 100 Derby blades cost me a bit under $8...</li>
            <li>These are the better of the blades I ordered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for sure.</li>
            <li>My son who is starting to shave its perfect for him.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such a wonderful leg shave!</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;second&#x27; best double edge blade.  </li>
            <li>I love my shaves</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite safety razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice smooth shave on the legs.</li>
            <li>ok-</li>
            <li>an area where Merkur blades seem to suit me better.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can order them 100 at a time is even better.</li>
            <li>i love these blades a lot and would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li>But, if you get 3 to 5 shaves out of a blade, well then, that makes the bargain even better.  </li>
            <li>They do not irritate the skin one bit and gave me a way better shave than any disposable razor.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent price and it works better than the Merkur blade for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>They are made in Sweden and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two or three shaves seems about the maximum rather than five or six (or more) with Astra, Merkur, Feather, etc.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor blade.</li>
            <li>So wonderfully cheap!</li>
            <li>Better than $35-$40 for 8 cartridges and</li>
            <li>the shave is much better to boot</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re wrapped safe and they shouldn&#x27;t rust out while they&#x27;re wrapped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many razor blades.  </li>
            <li>they get the job done, and i love the nifty plastic blade holders that you can also dispose of your used blades in.</li>
            <li>I rate these as somewhat better than Personnas.</li>
            <li>and I now have a supply for many years.</li>
            <li>Used this brand before, always gives a nice smooth cut.</li>
            <li>so others might get better life out of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find any better value.</li>
            <li>But the Harry&#x27;s cartridges give me a better shave and don&#x27;t take a sample of my A+ blood, no matter how closely I shave.</li>
            <li>These have become one of my 2 favorite blades.</li>
            <li>Sure there are sharper blades out there</li>
            <li>It provides a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a steak knife would be a better option.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the more pricey blades may have a keener edge,&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li>I can get 4-6 &#x27;no-nick&#x27; shaves from this blade, why spend more for a blade</li>
            <li>I guess not terrible for the price though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recon I need to buy any more blades for a year.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>For the price you can not do better,</li>
            <li>100 genuine Derby blades for around $20!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find better blades for the money.</li>
            <li>This experience has inspired me to buy a variety pack and see if I can find an even better alternative.</li>
            <li>They will shred your skin, leave tons of stubble and give you more bumps on your face than a herpes out break.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve since found another brand that works much much better for me (Feather blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good, inexpensive, double-edged razor blade Derby would be well worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I purchased these ones and Feather to compare which ones are better</li>
            <li>The shave is not quite as close, but more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li>However, this one is my brother&#x27;s favorite blade.</li>
            <li>I did fall for the hype &amp; shaved with cartridge razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>With my latest razors I&#x27;ve tried these and Astras and I&#x27;ve got to say</li>
            <li>, I feel like I get a better shave with these Derbys than I do with the Astras.  </li>
            <li>I do love Feather blades because they shave the closest</li>
            <li>I tried Derby and Feather, and for me, Derby gave me the better results.  </li>
            <li>I use an Edwin Jagger DE89, and absolutely love shaving now.</li>
            <li>but I think I like these blades even better.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am still trying to see how many shaves I can get from one blade.  </li>
            <li>got Astra that I will be trying, hopefully they are better than these.</li>
            <li>AND DERBYS ARE MORE FORGIVING.</li>
            <li>Do not use them for more than one shave.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  </li>
            <li>You get so many it saves $ and time from running to the store.</li>
            <li>Check out youtube videos if you need more tips on shaving with a safty razor.  </li>
            <li>We will purchase again for sure.  </li>
            <li>I always bought razors from Walgreens or Walmart, the house brand, and paid much more.</li>
            <li>I fear it will be even more aggressive than the WS</li>
            <li>with proper preparation, a pre shave oil and a perfect lather</li>
            <li>but more tugging and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These razors are my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they did</li>
            <li>I tried the Astra  blades and they were more aggressive and I bled more</li>
            <li>most cuts were under the nose and in the corner of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I ditched the Cartridge razors many years ago in favor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of pushing a razor over my face three or four times, although there are many out there who are.  </li>
            <li>These blades might be great for a beginner because they are very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know how many blade 100 is until you get this package.</li>
            <li>- you get so much more for your money when you do.</li>
            <li>Hopefully their production issues will have gotten worked out before I need to order more blades</li>
            <li>If you do they give outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>I threw them away its better of just to go with the merkur razors.</li>
            <li>shaves more.</li>
            <li>There are many others out there</li>
            <li>There are many others out there</li>
            <li>If I experiment with another blade it will be only out of curiosity because the Derby blades seem about perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I think that razor does not position the blade as aggressively, so I had to take more passes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I got a variety pack awhile back and the Derby Extras gave me the best shave and lasted the longest.</li>
            <li>outstanding product i wish i would have bought years ago...would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li>For the price, you won&#x27;t find better blades.</li>
            <li>The quality of these blades are OK and seem to be hit/</li>
            <li>So glad I picked these.</li>
            <li>These blades are OK but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>After prepping as explained, my shave this morning with a fresh Derby blade is as good as I expect out of any blade.  </li>
            <li>Medium rating in sharpness, but works well in a more aggressive DE razor.</li>
            <li>Seems to work best when shaving daily.</li>
            <li>These are barely ok.</li>
            <li>The feathers cost more.</li>
            <li>I bought a variety pack of blades when I switched to DE shaving, and found the Derby Extra to be best for my face.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for the price, turns out they are my favorite blade.</li>
            <li>There are better blades like Astra for the money.  </li>
            <li>Great blades and very affordable.</li>
            <li>My  favorite blades and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>I seem to be able to shave faster with this blade</li>
            <li>but maybe I am just getting better at it.</li>
            <li>Derby Extra is without a doubt the best of all that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got a brick of 100 razors with this order.  </li>
            <li>This is a very economically way to by some nice blades.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the edge is good.</li>
            <li>Great sharp blades at a great price.</li>
            <li>i had great success with Astra and no irritation whatsoever, and they would just glide through and slice all the hairs cleanly and with ease.</li>
            <li>With the prices of 3, 4, and 5 blade replacement cartridges going higher all the time it is wonderful to find this inexpensive yet very efficient alternative.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not made in Russia, Greece, or Germany which are the most consistent quality wise by reputation.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that happy Derby users have a very fine and soft beards.</li>
            <li>These are high quality razors at a great price.</li>
            <li>For the price and the amount of blades included, this was a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>Tried for the first time, good quality.</li>
            <li>I use a good amount of lather and consistent shave angle.</li>
            <li>First use Olive oil after taking shower, massage it good, then take quality foam or Shaving cream and brush.  </li>
            <li>Use a hot soap cup and badger brush for optimum shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s a pretty good idea to change blades</li>
            <li>Good first blade for noobies to practice their technique before moving on to a sharper blade.</li>
            <li>Great for those that are new to safety razors, like me.</li>
            <li>Great blades, I haven&#x27;t had to buy new ones for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>Very glad I did, they seem to be the right blades for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for this many blades, but I find they don&#x27;t hold an edge nearly as well as Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly into my Edwin Jagger double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>There was a time when I thought all blades should last forever, then found good shaving takes good blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap and coming from a guy who has to shave every third day, they work awesome.</li>
            <li>Less than $8 is an incredible price for 100 blades, so I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazingly inexpensive and very effective especially for the scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work fine.  </li>
            <li>These razors worked just fine, and they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li>They get your face so clean cut!</li>
            <li>Even avid shavers should have a pretty good run with this!</li>
            <li>Before Derby, I had purchased blades from Wallmart and tht were like 5 blades for $3 and this was like $10 for 100 which is great deal and works good, sharp and satusfied.</li>
            <li>Still, that&#x27;s a nice smooth clean</li>
            <li>Sexy smooth legs</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m extremely happy with their performance.</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s are the most comfortable and closest shaves</li>
            <li>it has given me the closest, most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Of all the blades I use, this one provides the smoothest and most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also not as smooth as the platinum coated ones I tried, but slightly better than the cheapo brand.</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder why more men don&#x27;t use safety razors, given how cheaply one can get his hands on blades like this.  </li>
            <li>All I can tell you is that they work much better than drugstore razors and they are ridiculously cheap.  </li>
            <li>But then I got to try some Derby blades that came free with a shaving brush I bought, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth his skin is with these razors.</li>
            <li>100 blades for $10 is a great value, but if 20 of those blades mangle your face, you&#x27;re better off spending a couple extra bucks on a better brand.</li>
            <li>but, they are the most forgiving and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very forgiving on those who&#x27;ve not yet mastered the art of building a good lather for slip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Really good blades for the price and very forgiving</li>
            <li>It really feels good to walk by box store displays of three or four blades for twelve or thirteen bucks of &#x27;safety razor&#x27; blades.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat a good shave with a real blade</li>
            <li>it is strongly recommended that you pick up a blade sampler pack (there are many available here on Amazon)</li>
            <li>Great for those who have sensitive skin and get irritated easy.</li>
            <li>Also excellent, a little sharper but very smooth.  </li>
            <li>With good shaving soap like Taylor of Old Bond St..and hydrating your skin properly Derby is a good product and good value...Jlewis0904@comcast.net Philly, Pa</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the blades and smoothness of the shave, as compared to other brands Shark and Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sharp blade and it delivers an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Awesome razors, there sharp and have no defects</li>
            <li>They stayed sharp with the best in the bunch, but weren&#x27;t overly aggressive in my razor.</li>
            <li>I will however continue to try all the brands I can get ahold of; after all, they are all better then the original fancy razors.</li>
            <li>Needs more environmentally friendly packaging for bulk quantity.</li>
            <li>If you do plan on using a new blade for each shave, I would again recommend these Derby blades because lets be honest, under $10 for 100 blades is about the best deal you can get, especially since each blade has two edges.</li>
            <li>no matter what so its easy to keep track.</li>
            <li>I think this could easily be a 9 to 12 month supply of blades.  </li>
            <li>Yes you have to have a razor that accepts these blades, but you can easily buy one of these razors for about 30 bucks--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a touch to easy to slide the razor sideways while running it along your head, and the 3 times I tried it</li>
            <li>Packaging makes dispensing blades easy.</li>
            <li>, these blades work and will not rip your face off, seems like an easy choice.</li>
            <li>Easy blades to begin shaving with.</li>
            <li>so I can easily take one when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li>shaves easily, I could probably push them but why bother.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very mild on my face</li>
            <li>My wonderful wife got them for me and when I opened them, I really felt old school holding that retro looking package of 100 double-edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are what I would call a very mild razor blade.  </li>
            <li>easy.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works as described and easy to install into the razor.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>Clean up passes didn’t result in a much better shave.</li>
            <li>I got a kit of a few blades to test and these are the best for most people.</li>
            <li>I can easily get  five shaves out of one blade, and if I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cost of replacing the blade too soon.  </li>
            <li>Good for four shaves and a decent shave on the fifth.</li>
            <li>Well price wise, its a good deal, however, the blade itself almost ruined wet shaving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked very much the product, it is easy and efficient for use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking a good blades.</li>
            <li>It took several attempts to find the right razor that worked best on my face.  </li>
            <li>This generally are great blades.</li>
            <li>Besides, how cool is it to be able to say you shave &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>I have found the perfect balance between sharp and smooth with these gems.</li>
            <li>But it is simply excellent - sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Like most people I turned to a DE (safety) shaver in full scale revolt against overpriced drugstore razors from Gillette, Schick, etc.  </li>
            <li>A shave as good as any brand new, 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>and they work fine, so</li>
            <li>The blades seem to be fine.  </li>
            <li>Another fine product from Turkey.</li>
            <li>Derby razors are not the sharpest, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>That is fine, we are all unique.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they work fine in the milder ones also.</li>
            <li>They shave just fine, no issues at all using them with my DE razor.</li>
            <li>However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
            <li>Fine razors.</li>
            <li>I used it in a ReMei razor and it did a good job removing a day’s worth of stubble on the first pass.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine in my Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
            <li>These are his favorite blades and buying in bulk makes them super affordable.</li>
            <li>These probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best thing if you had really super thick hair or were planing to shave your head with them or something, but for medium hair/ womens leg hair (yes, ladies, these are better than Venus razors!)</li>
            <li>So much cheaper and better!</li>
            <li>I got these when I was new to wet-shaving because they were cheap, they were the blades that came with my razor, and they had good reviews here.  </li>
            <li>Heck, use a brush and cream/soap if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing, but if quick and cheap is more your style, foam is fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their materials and quality seem top notch as the razors are long lasting and give a great shave while their sharpness is also great too.</li>
            <li>Very impressed for how little they cost.</li>
            <li>They were a little too aggressive for me, but for others they may be a perfect blade.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to a premium blade, and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>If you use each blade 3 times you can go almost all year on just this pack, or you can go buy a store razor or disposable razors and just pay these huge corporations who overcharge on their product to begin with and just throw your money in the trash...</li>
            <li>and I decided to purchase the Derby blades because the quantity that you get for such a cheap price is just great.  </li>
            <li>Stop spending the big bucks on cartage razor and use these if you want a close comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li>These razors work fantastic on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a smooth shave without the cuts and scrapes that I get from Dorco ST301s and Shark blades.</li>
            <li>A bunch in a cheap package.</li>
            <li>will continue to use these not only for quality but for the great price</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the pragmatic and ritualistic aspects of wet-shaving.  </li>
            <li>Used shark blades before with better success.</li>
            <li>Too be honest, they remind me of Merkur blades (which also work very well on my beard).</li>
            <li>Cheapest blade available: 100 blades for $7.50.</li>
            <li>Great blades that last me about 3 weeks each.  </li>
            <li>These are very consistently smooth blades and packaged well.</li>
            <li>did not provide a smooth result, pulls on whiskers, leaves face feeling irritated.</li>
            <li>I prefer these blades, they are light and the coating helps them slide smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li>I want to try the sharpest blades available</li>
            <li>Great value for a 100 pack and will probably last me 1-2 yrs.</li>
            <li>Quality has diminished since construction left great Britain.</li>
            <li>He is on second box with no complaints and great shaves.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pay a buck a day to brush my teeth or comb my hair, so a great shave should be no different.</li>
            <li>Now, the important part: Is it for me?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a total win in my book.</li>
            <li>Price is fantastic...</li>
            <li>I do it because I enjoy doing it.  </li>
            <li>I always want to enjoy doing whatever I do in life and wasn&#x27;t going to make an exception with shaving.  </li>
            <li>Yet, provides smooth cut without dragging .</li>
            <li>fit the razor I bought.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with this razor and it works great in my double edge safety razor from Edwin jagger.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic blades.</li>
            <li>This blade will cut smoothly on a beard of medium thickness or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the same blade for five great shaves.</li>
            <li>, that is still cheap.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hack away at your face and my goodness are they cheap.</li>
            <li>Keeping your blade cost below $0.10 per blade is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a safety razor is much better if you are using a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>A great price on these and each blade tends to last 3-5 days for me.  </li>
            <li>Now using this blade/razor combo I am baby smooth nearly all day, which is something I rarely ever experienced before.  </li>
            <li>actually enjoy shaving now</li>
            <li>I can get a comfortable shave that is close and nick free.</li>
            <li>A close comfortable shave with 2 passes and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and he says it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This blade I&#x27;ve learned is all I personally need to get a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Have semi coarse beard and these give me a great shave.</li>
            <li>but that is cheap compared to what you spend on Mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>They give these blades away in razors because they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great blades, they last a 3-5 shaves for me.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job well as I can feel my smooth face after</li>
            <li>Blades are rust free and fit my grooming comb.  </li>
            <li>I use each blade for about a week &amp; could probably use them longer, but they are so cheap at about 10 cents</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and I find myself feeling it throughout the day...</li>
            <li>Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>definetly worth the price but better blades out there.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li>These leave your face feeling smooth with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I got a free 5 pack sampler and decided to try them.</li>
            <li>These are terrific blades, and represent a great value for your dollar.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is replace the blades often to prevent any skin irritation and to develop smooth skin.</li>
            <li>and after one pass the skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever had the joy to shave with a double edge you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>For me switching to shaving with a double edge safety razor and all it involves has made shaving a joy for me</li>
            <li>Enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth as Astra.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave with no razor burn and isn&#x27;t overly aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>These blades were &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; by me, and so far, are a good purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also tried a very diverse multi-brand sample pack and found that Derby and Blue Bird were the best blades for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure you prep your face prior to shaving and use a good post shave lotion.</li>
            <li>The quality seems good so far</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>To find out what works best with YOUR face/shaving technique/products, YOU really need to try some different blades.  </li>
            <li>I get two good shaves from each razor with no cuts or scrapes so far.</li>
            <li>Box looks sweet on the shelf with all the cool Arabic writing on it too!</li>
            <li>I find it great that it&#x27;s not too sharp as it allows you to perform a 3 pass shave no problem with some good lather to get a real close shave.</li>
            <li>Having converted to safety razor shaving I decided to give these blades a try after reading several reviews, and happy to say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I shave pretty aggressively (I use more pressure than I probably should) and still enjoy a fine shave with no bumps, irritation, or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>What you see its exactly what you get!!</li>
            <li>VERY ECONOMICAL.</li>
            <li>Very economical.</li>
            <li>This is a very economical blade so that would be a plus.</li>
            <li>Originally tried these when they came free with a DE razor I purchased.  </li>
            <li>and I highly suggest get a sampler of different DE razors to see which works best for beginners first.ch, these are probably some of the dullest blades you can get but forgiving for beginners like me.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give wet shaving a try, and based on so many excellent reviews, picked up a box of 100 of these blades along with my new razor.</li>
            <li>Just smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades have a good reputation, a huge following, and are probably the most economical option available concerning blades.</li>
            <li>They shave nice and clean and smooth when they are new.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, as always, Keep Calm and Shave On!</li>
            <li>these have become my favorite and go to first blades</li>
            <li>started out with a sampler pack, and was glad I was able to try many different blades.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>100ct for like $8 is over 2 years worth of shaving for me!</li>
            <li>I really need more history with these, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>how many sha0ves I will get from a blade but am sure more than what I got fro those blue plastic two blade razors.</li>
            <li>I also need to ensure that the angle of razor to face is more consistent.</li>
            <li>Since I first picked up the double-edge razor I&#x27;ve reduced appearances of razor bumps while being able to shave like my Angelo-Saxon friends.</li>
            <li>so worth a try if you haven&#x27;t tried them!</li>
            <li>I realize that these Derby blades are a bit more forgiving for first time users.</li>
            <li>The way this morning&#x27;s shave felt, I may get one or two more shaves with this first blade.</li>
            <li>The best part is that these are so cheap you can shave forever and hardly spend anything.</li>
            <li>A nice new blade for every shave will leave you feeling like a million bucks after every shower.</li>
            <li>although the blades have varied in edge sharpness, i have luckily been able to find more of my shaves comfortable--some new blades have varied in their edge.</li>
            <li>but they are better than I expected and really good for the price.</li>
            <li>Super cheap blades.</li>
            <li>They are on the gentle side of the spectrum so if you have sensitive skin they are great.  </li>
            <li>Product is good, cheap compared to big name twin, three or four blades razors.  </li>
            <li>I have a thinner beard growth but require a clean shave for work, these work well for me.</li>
            <li>After about 5 uses I grab a clean razor</li>
            <li>They are super cheap and shave well.  </li>
            <li>For around $7.50, I get 200 clean shaves.</li>
            <li>The only people giving these good reviews are people that were introduced to them as free razors.  </li>
            <li>Does NOT give a clean shave.</li>
            <li>No matter how clean your strike you are NOT getting through in one swing</li>
            <li>I tried nearly a dozen different brands of blades before settling on Derby as the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, and the Derby Extra DE blades have worked out the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Because I can get so many for so cheap, it&#x27;s not a tough call for me to get one shave out of the each blade and just toss it.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave without paying the super high prices for the triple or quad blade razors/moneypits.  </li>
            <li>$10 for 100&#x3D; 10 cent a blade, lasts me 5 shaves, but I could throw away after every single shave and it would stll be a great value.</li>
            <li>The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves the skin VERY smooth after a 2 pass.</li>
            <li>The Derbys are very smooth and very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Great smooth shave, not too sharp as to cut face up.</li>
            <li>These blades have a good edge that they keep for more cycles than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This razor is good for the beginner and can be carried on to a &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; for most other shavers.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a nice shave cream (Proraso or Col Conk), use a badger or boar hair brush to apply it, recommend a Merkur double edge and put a Derby razor in there, and you will get an awesome shave for much less money.</li>
            <li>Find the right blade for your skin!</li>
            <li>Solid, well made, and all-around fine safety razors at a great price buying in a 100 count pack.</li>
            <li>These razor blades seem dull at best.</li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s be honest, i am most excited about the mirror and how i can use these flexible things to clean other smooth surfaces if needed.</li>
            <li>If you are really concerned about the &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; of your razor blade, it is more important to use a fresh blade each time you shave, not to buy the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blade out there.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival and use, they are excellent and have worked well for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>their throats..great for experienced wet shavers as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the blades and they&#x27;ve all been great on the first shave...</li>
            <li>Each side is good for two to three shaves, and since I&#x27;m in that habit of shaving about five times per week, I only need to change the blade about once per week.</li>
            <li>With the economy the way it is, having a smooth face for such a low price is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li>you use the double edge system, these are a good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same blade for over a week and was still getting good shaves from it.  </li>
            <li>but I love these so much and don&#x27;t have any need to switch.</li>
            <li>This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li>I get a closer shave with the Derby Razors, Also these blades are very affordable, I intend to order more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a much closer shave with these blades than the ones that came with the Micro Touch One.</li>
            <li>Many people rave about the Feather blades, but I cannot comment because I have not tried them, however, for about 10 cents a blade you&#x27;ll get a very forgiving blade with the Derby.  </li>
            <li>something that I could not do with most razors, including the one that came with my Merkur safety razor thus resulting in a much shinier dome.  </li>
            <li>It slices straight thru and leaves him smooth faced!</li>
            <li>But each blade is only good for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper and each blade lasts just as many shaves as a cartridge razor</li>
            <li>The value is good but just plan to take some extra time.</li>
            <li>Having to use so many means they really aren&#x27;t inexpensive.</li>
            <li>you want these blades, only buy 10-20 to learn and then move onto the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a full beard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true,</li>
            <li>One blade is good enough for me!!!</li>
            <li>My last shave with the blade is still a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of blades and the Derby are my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>not bad..</li>
            <li>Also not bad with my Merkur Vision.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are not as Wallmart one but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Again, for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>I use these mostly for light shaves and for $10 for a 100ct you can use a new one every shave and never have to listen to your wallet cringe.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent starter blade for new wet shavers</li>
            <li>That super smooth against the grain shave isn&#x27;t worth my face burning the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that this single blade does a better job than the 10 blade Gillette turbo ultra vibrating swivel jet.</li>
            <li>Really great blades, not too aggressive, but more than enough to give you a close, relatively nick free shave.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades, look forward to shaving now with my new shaver !  </li>
            <li>They are super affordable to use.</li>
            <li>Derby blades aren&#x27;t defective, they are decent and better than Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li>What blades are best truly relies on the individual&#x27;s skin and facial hair qualities.</li>
            <li>Maybe im shaving too quickly</li>
            <li>I compared these blades to my Merkur Super blades and both blades are identical in size.</li>
            <li>If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li>The second and third shaves are the best with this blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get what you pay for, if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li>, when I first got my first safety razor, I did what most do.</li>
            <li>Really wasn&#x27;t impressed with them, and found that just after a few days that blades seems to have pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Soap up, shave one way, use the remaining lather on the brush and do another quick pass.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional bargain for those of us who use a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Maybe 3 or 4 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for beginner wetshavers because they&#x27;re very forgiving, however, your face/facial hair may be different from mine and this blade may not suit you</li>
            <li>The Voshkod and Gillette Silver Blue provided better shaving results and more shaves per blade for me.  </li>
            <li>I have to change blades after a couple of shaves, but the price for 100 blades is a super bargain.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive but these blades work great and are cheap enough to switch out the blades often.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>There are many shaving snobs out there that act as if shaving is high art.  </li>
            <li>I get 4 really good shaves out of a blade, and could squeeze 1 or 2 more but that requires a little more force and thus increased irritation, so after 4 shaves I go to a new blade.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blades gives a really close shave and also have very good prices.</li>
            <li>Not too razor sharp, so great for beginners, and price of about 10 cents/blade is economical for one-shave average/blade.</li>
            <li>But I am happy I did go back, Blades are good for a few shaves.</li>
            <li>The Derby blades are nice and sharp, giving me a much better shave than the starter blades I received.</li>
            <li>I could not get these blades to give a smooth, reasonably close shave without getting chewed up and/or needing a 4th pass!</li>
            <li>Great starting point for beginners, but one should determine later, with more experience shaving, if 100 is needed.</li>
            <li>they are much sharper, and also extremely smooth, but cut the skin much more readily.</li>
            <li>These look good and function well in my merkur long handle.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need a brush or fancy cream - good old canned shave cream foam (Barbasol or similar) works fine with DE blades.  </li>
            <li>When you get a good one, these blades are a good as any I&#x27;ve tried, but a fair number have been off the mark - dull, uneven, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with these cost effective blades and recommend them for any new DE wet shaver.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and perform VERY well for about 4-5 shaves so why not change them slightly more frequently than necessary and great shave everytime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the Derby&#x27;s work best for me when I shave no less than every other day.  </li>
            <li>Great price, but the blades weren&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li>Great Swedish blades for the money, very sharp, depending on your beard can use each blade up to a week.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, great price.</li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks&#x27; practice and one or two good YouTube vids, but stainless steel dual edge blades shave as well or better than Mach3 or other cartridge</li>
            <li>(albeit the feather is wicked smooth since it is equally wicked sharp requiring excellent lathering technique).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, but the razors that came with my razor did a better job.</li>
            <li>Tried the Wilkinson classic made in Germany, much sharper and much more comfortable shave than the Derby.</li>
            <li>so their sharpness is pretty good and combine that with the overall price</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been satisfied with most \\&quot;hi-tech\\&quot; nonsense razors systems in America for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I will also note that my hair is fine, and even so I could still tell a large difference.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a single good shave with derby razors.</li>
            <li>Good, sharp, clean blades.</li>
            <li>a can&#x27;t tell much difference !!</li>
            <li>The first shave, is smoother than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life!</li>
            <li>Safety razors are way better and 1000x cheaper to utilize than those Fusion or Mach products on store shelves, do not waste your money... get a safety razor and some derby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>If you have have sensitive skin and not a thick beard the Derby will probably fit you nicely.</li>
            <li>I need to work on my skin tightening and facial muscles to make the razor glide more easily.</li>
            <li>and if for some odd reason they aren&#x27;t right for you they will make a great PIF.</li>
            <li>Great shave these little babies provide.</li>
            <li>Close shave, little to no irritation, and a great value when buying 100 pack.</li>
            <li>last for several shaves and also they are a very good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many good Derby blades, however, every blade in this pack of one hundred has been extremely dull.  </li>
            <li>A huge bundle of these can more than easily last you a year!</li>
            <li>The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li>but nothing that stood out as something I would really want to keep or buy in bulk as my primary blade.</li>
            <li>I really like the smooth, close shave I get with these blades.  </li>
            <li>so my husband says they are great for the razor, and we both agree that they save a lot of waste (think: no disposable cartridges with all the plastic packaging that comes along with the)...</li>
            <li>When shaving my face, I get a very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving with these straight razor&#x27;s gives a smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have really grown to appreciate what a smooth shave I get with these Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving yet very forgiving.</li>
            <li>smooth cut (sometimes cuts too much maybe)...</li>
            <li>They are smooth and don&#x27;t cause irritation, they just don&#x27;t give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Very forgiving blade, but does not provide me with a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>so you can safely dispose of your old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use one blade a week, then throw it out and replace it with a fresh one.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>the Derby&#x27;s are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>No irritation and rarely do I cut myself with these.</li>
            <li>Still worth the price we paid for all of them together.</li>
            <li>Provides a far superior shave to any cartridge style razor I have ever used and is considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have the ability to grow a full beard so with each shave I am plowing through a lot of stubble and even with that fact in mind these Derby blades have not failed to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li>A week&#x27;s worth of shaving for under 10 cents?  </li>
            <li>and well worth it.</li>
            <li>I own one and it doesn&#x27;t extend the blade&#x27;s life appreciably - certainly not enough to justify the cost.</li>
            <li>Price is nice, but I may purchase a different brand when these are depleted.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that is the norm and even so it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li>That is over years&#x27; worth of blades in one shot.</li>
            <li>Not for me, even a fresh blade felt like it was pulling out hairs and not cutting them.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is that each blade come individually wrapped in bandaid style wrapping paper.  </li>
            <li>They come in individual packages of five, which is nice when traveling.</li>
            <li>If you have a razor like the old time ones you will love these</li>
            <li>well worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Just bought a hundred (that&#x27;s about two years worth for me).</li>
            <li>Worth buying in the 100 box.</li>
            <li>I have been using these blades for several weeks now and they work nicely.</li>
            <li>Prior to that I had used Shark blades (which I liked) and Feather blades (</li>
            <li>But it is well worth the time.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Derby is a nice blade for a low price.</li>
            <li>I have got almost two weeks worth of shaving out of one blade.</li>
            <li>but well worth the time, effort and money.</li>
            <li>100 blades for $10 sure beats the $20+ for a pack of 4 for the old Gillette.</li>
            <li>These are clearly the most forgiving/non aggressive blades in the market place.  </li>
            <li>Whoa...the Derbys are by far better.  </li>
            <li>Darn good middle of the road blade really.  </li>
            <li>It would be really useful to me if there was a 25 count of these blades.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and lasts for about a week before dullness and stains set in.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the $.</li>
            <li>Bought these with a new Weishi premium long handle razor, they work great.</li>
            <li>that adds up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The blades are good however not as sharp as I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I need good sharp blades that are not going to irritate.</li>
            <li>and the price is really a good buy, if you compare it to other</li>
            <li>Sharp and cut good.</li>
            <li>Good and sharp.</li>
            <li>ASTRAS WERE A LITTLE MORE FORGIVING ,VERY SHARP AND EXCELLENT VALUE.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews that these were a good value, I decided to go for it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a couple of snobs in here talking these blades down only because of its price, lol.</li>
            <li>I find these blades to be just right with longevity and shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>and it still plows right through it after a weeks growth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest going to Shaving 101 to read their article on \\&quot;Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I figured I just didn&#x27;t have the touch to do it right.</li>
            <li>Finding razor blade is like Goldilocks and The 3 Bears--what might be right for you, may not be right for some.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>give it 5 stars for all the right reasons.</li>
            <li>These blades do not disappoint and the price is right for 100.  </li>
            <li>These  razors are just right.  </li>
            <li>I find them the right balance of smoothness and effectiveness -- and at the right price.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>You need to find the right blade for your razor and hair type.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re just right.</li>
            <li>I will try other blades over time, but these blades are more than satisfactory to give me a smooth clean shave that exceeds cartridges closeness.</li>
            <li>The Derby gives a great shave without the raw feeling of the Feather.  </li>
            <li>The blades themselves are the exact quality I expected them to be, and I was absolutely delighted with the speed of the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li>It either cuts my face too much, or doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs cleanly or well at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated, and these derby blades make shaving a nightmare of tissue and stiptic pens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no other blades to compare to, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying clean and inexpensive shaves for years off that first box, and FINALLY have had to replace the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and I can safely say they work very well for the beginner.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use, I bought this a while back and still haven&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I have been using double edge razors for many years and own several.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Double Edge Razor blades tend to be a controversial topic for some.</li>
            <li>These work best for me on their second shave - I should probably try corking, but so far it&#x27;s working well enough.</li>
            <li>These blades were not as good as Feather, Wilkinson and other brands!</li>
            <li>Nice shave, usualy last 4 shaves - nice and sharp but not overly aggressive.</li>
            <li>Of course, everyone&#x27;s face and beard is different, so your results may vary, but these are sure worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve much better success and would suggest that anyone starting to wet-shave try a sample pack of blades, rather than these.  </li>
            <li>Of course, you&#x27;ll need to try various blades if you have a different razor than me, but this is a great combination in my experience.</li>
            <li>I only get one or two comfortable shaves out of each blade, but they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li>I got into double edge shaving mostly for economical reasons</li>
            <li>10% of the blades are good for less than 5 days.</li>
            <li>I currently use Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, but any good shave cream will work well.  </li>
            <li>If the zombie apocalypse happens in the near future, I&#x27;ll have a nice clean shave for quite some time.</li>
            <li>When using a DE razor I will highly suggest everyone to clean there blades with sterile alcohol</li>
            <li>Sure, some expert shaving researchers out there have used their fancy electron microscopes to determine that some other brands have blades that are a few microns thinner, and therefore sharper, but let&#x27;s be honest, for more than twice the price is it worth it?</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, the choice of double edged razors is pretty personal - all I can say is that these work just great for me.</li>
            <li>The cost of these razors are so cheap in comparison to cartridges for the old razors we would purchase at the store!</li>
            <li>Granted, using the old fashion double edged razor is not every ones cup of tea, but if your willing to put a wee effort into your morning shave, these blades are certainly a good value.  </li>
            <li>I like these blades very much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Picking a DE blade is a personal choice -- these work for me and happen to be a great value, but any DE blade is a better deal than those horrible 5-blade plastic monstrosities people &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; with, so buy a bunch and pick what you like best -- just include Derby in your pool when you do.</li>
            <li>Derby extra is very cheap and but this affects a bit of quality.</li>
            <li>They lose their edge very very fast.</li>
            <li>I appreciate how this particular set is packaged in convenient little boxes of five, great for travel.</li>
            <li>Shave so nice and smooth with these blades and were highly reccomended by other users.</li>
            <li>Preparation is the most important, just like every other task.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, thanks!</li>
            <li>Had my first DE shave today using these blades in a Jagger 89 razor.  </li>
            <li>They do exactly what you&#x27;d expect razor blades to do.</li>
            <li>Slightly more cuts, but the irritation was actually quite a bit lower.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely notice a bit more tug and pull with these blades.</li>
            <li>I first started using them with a safety razor 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>chose this rating as i used the first blade..</li>
            <li>Excellent price, but not excellent</li>
            <li>Is exactly what they are.</li>
            <li>Mostly with Wilkinson blades though I have used Mekur, Astra, Feather (lost a bit of my lip to the only one I ever used)</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s are the first blade I have used with no learning curve.</li>
            <li>they work great for me, but then again I don&#x27;t have a thick bushy beard.</li>
            <li>fast!  </li>
            <li>My buddy uses Derby for his straight edge too!  </li>
            <li>It was my first time buying them.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TO SHAVE 5X A WEEK FOR WORK AND AM A PRETTY HAIRY GUY.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>and it creates razor bumps and irritation unlike my current favorite, astra.</li>
            <li>Better than the standard blade that came with my Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li>Currently you can&#x27;t find a better blade than these at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feathers are sharper at first, but become unusable after a couple of shaves.  </li>
            <li>and I think it will last me a couple more months.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my first DE attempt.</li>
            <li>Double edge blades are the most subjective thing in the world.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So 100 blades should last me a while :)</li>
            <li>(Better than Feather for daily shaving, IMHO.)</li>
            <li>I can get two weeks&#x27; use out of each blade by flipping it over after the first week.</li>
            <li>, The Derby Extra has always been the top  performer for me-</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back to my favorite blade!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time didn&#x27;t go so well</li>
            <li>(I can let it get pretty scruffy because I work from home)</li>
            <li>you insist on trying them, please try a sample pack first, because you don&#x27;t want to get stuck with 100 POS blades like I did.</li>
            <li>I bought a sampler package from the many independent sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>can say my second favorite are Shark razors.</li>
            <li>Great price when buying bulk -- I should have these for at least two years.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for a first time DE shaver, and here is why:  </li>
            <li>they give a nice close shave with minimal cuts and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how so many people can write such glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>Even the Wilkinson or generic blades from Wal-Mart or Kroger are waaaay better than these things.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m preferring these over the Lord, Wilkinson, and Feather, in my Lord L6 handle, though all are pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact I am able to use blade for multiple days before I need to change it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and yes, I do know how to shave properly. :)</li>
            <li>At 100 count - this should last for many years.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased a 50 pack, so I&#x27;ll be shaving with Derby for the better part of the next year.</li>
            <li>I figured if I couldn&#x27;t use them I&#x27;d hand them off to friends (which is exactly what I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person.</li>
            <li>Consistent shave and affordable.</li>
            <li>I look like just survived an assassination attempt when I try to shave with the same blade more than once.</li>
            <li>how much is 5 years of mach 3 blades worth?</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 4 or 5 days with the same razor, I start to notice that I need more passes to get a close shave so plan to swap them out every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li>:) Will definitely purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat $.08 cents a razor, and this gives really close shaves!  </li>
            <li>I actually find that I&#x27;m able to go against the grain on my scalp;</li>
            <li>So not only is this a heck of a lot cheaper than cartridge shaving, but I get a lot closer, and better shave without all the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Derby blade in most of my double edge razors.</li>
            <li>These are the first blades I have bought for my DE Razor.  </li>
            <li>pretty uniformly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than those triple and quad-bladed razors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extras for several weeks now and am pleased with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li>I initially tried the Sharkies and I like these better.</li>
            <li>This is the first set of blades I have bought for my DE razors.</li>
            <li>You get the sharpest blades and your face looks like you fell face first off a motorcycle.</li>
            <li>The blades are then safely contained, and if I lose it, I&#x27;m only out five of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>See you in 2014 ;)</li>
            <li>I should have tried sample pack first.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t even feel it most of the time initially.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still on the first one).  </li>
            <li>I still have many years of shaving left in this body, I hope.</li>
            <li>There are better blade such as a feather.</li>
            <li>First time using a safety razor</li>
            <li>definitely go back to this seller for more</li>
            <li>These were exactly  what I needed and quite inexpensive per blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll some more of these next year when I run out.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not cutting myself as much and</li>
            <li>These however are even better priced and a pack of a 100 should last you a couple years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a first timer and cut my fingers accidentally.</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving with a DE razor</li>
            <li>First, they&#x27;re made in Turkey, not Sweden.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  </li>
            <li>the future I am unsure if I would purchase more of these.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to it as much as my first cup of coffee in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so this razor may be better for you than it was for me.  </li>
            <li>Seem to last for more shaves too.</li>
            <li>Most people on the shaving forums feel the same.</li>
            <li>First time using them, I did nick myself once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a variety of DE razor blades when I first started using DE razors.  </li>
            <li>I used this first blade for the 5th time this morning and it still outperforms the others I tried.</li>
            <li>And the price simply cannot be beat for so many.</li>
            <li>I do use the same blade more than once (three times</li>
            <li>(most recently Wilson Swords (?)).  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few others, but I get a good close shave with Derby.</li>
            <li>find that Derby&#x27;s are a good price, get me anywhere from 2-4 shaves per blade and after a few hundred of them I can say they are manufactured</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and did research online to find a good blade recommendation for a beginner.</li>
            <li>They are so cheap at about 10c a blade, you could use a new blade every day if you really wanted.</li>
            <li>These blades are nice, especially for someone new to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>previously used a pack of the Shark brand, which were good, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference with these, with the exception that they cost much</li>
            <li>I realize everyone&#x27;s needs differ, but I consistently get 5 clean, comfortable shaves per blade before changing it, and only do so because how much could do you expect for $0.09 per blade.</li>
            <li>I know that every face is different, and different blades suit peoples faces better than others, but this is a blade that i read good things about, but has only caused my face irritation.</li>
            <li>As an African American guy I am very prone to ingrown hairs, but these blades cut at just the right length to make my face look good and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as sharp as some brands who focus on being extra sharp, the Derbys are the perfect balance of sharpness in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Some experienced wet shavers advocate getting a sample pack of different brands of de blades to see which ones agrees to your razor, beard, and skin type.  </li>
            <li>with any double edge system, a good shaving cream and brush and necessary!</li>
            <li>I shave everyday for work and love the feel of my smooth face afterwards.</li>
            <li>they are good what you pay, Much better than expensive disposable  razors.</li>
            <li>I do multiple passes in different directions which you must do to get a good shave, these blades allow you to do this without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The price of the blades (even starting up for that matter) is a lot cheaper than buying the more modern shavers.</li>
            <li>Some blades are sharp, some are smooth, this is a fine combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Delivery was mixed with other items, came fairly quickly; packaging is good.</li>
            <li>.. I had my doubts at first because i usually use shark razors but after trying them, i&#x27;ll never go back, quick delivery and great product..</li>
            <li>Fortunately they seem to work really well for my lower neck which had real problems with my old disposable and also with some merkur blades  </li>
            <li>These are a great shave, they do not nick like some other safety blades I&#x27;ve used recently.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, Cheap, Fantastic, and get it.</li>
            <li>I use to think the red Personna and the lab blue Personna DE razor blades were the best for my sensitive skin, but these Derby Extra DE blades are far superior, and make the Personna&#x27;s feel rough.</li>
            <li>A hot shower really does help hydrate the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used about ten of these so far, and they are certainly superior among the blades I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for an average blade for my adjustable and these fill the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>Then when the jar is full, dispose of jar and old blades all at once.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough for a great shave but not sharp enough that you&#x27;ll need a PhD in shaving to get an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>They provide a great shave and last much longer than I expected!</li>
            <li>The blades are just sharp enough (no razor burn yet) to give me a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying this 100 count pack thinking the bargain was worth the risk on a new blade.</li>
            <li>Have been using these blades since December, great shave, I have a very thick coarse beard, and these cut clean !</li>
            <li>It is amazing what you can use a microwave for: a normal washcloth wet, then squeezed out, rolled up and heated for 50 seconds works for me.</li>
            <li>It is easily 1/5 the cost of regular shaving blades.  </li>
            <li>but since I have pretty light facial hair I figured they would work alright.</li>
            <li>At this price it&#x27;s easy to refill often, but I grow a moderate beard and if I have to</li>
            <li>and like a previous commenter stated, i may go out and buy a nice bottle of scotch after writing this with all the money i am saving.</li>
            <li>Not for me, apparently I have the most sensitive face on the planet.</li>
            <li>These blades are all individually wrapped in a paper sleeve and held together in plastic boxes in sets of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, easy to change.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would change blades every weekend, but sometimes a blade would last two weeks or more without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Derby 100 count box comes in individual packages of 5 blades so they are easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them with a  merkur future and merkur long handle and they seem to be good to use once and then throw away.</li>
            <li>I have a medium coarse beard and get a full weeks worth</li>
            <li>I find that my wet-shaving experience is best when I use a little baby oil before lathering up, much less irritation.</li>
            <li>people complain certain model blades are &amp;</li>
            <li>This requires 4 passes with each pass skipping certain areas.</li>
            <li>Some people swear by certain brands and avoid all others.</li>
            <li>even after 2-3 shaves the edge is better in a feather than a brand new Derby, I ended up giving these away to my local barber.</li>
            <li>I bought this brand before via Amazon and the previous purchase was far superior.</li>
            <li>Able to easily cut through thick hair without any issues.</li>
            <li>These are my first razors and they are extremely sharp, probably not the sharpest but for the price they are miles better than cartridges</li>
            <li>He wears a beard and only trims so they should do fine.</li>
            <li>and the rest stay in their nice little box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how many guys do not know that ALL double edge razor blades are designed for single use only.</li>
            <li>Blades are made in Turkey and are consistent high quality.</li>
            <li>I got 3 good shaves out it before it started to get dull.</li>
            <li>really these blades aren&#x27;t very high quality.</li>
            <li>and these really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it once he passed the learning curve of this type of razor.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>These blades work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>They shave very close</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Derby!</li>
            <li>nothing really to complain about.</li>
            <li>These blades work very well.  </li>
            <li>here I come haha</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Definitely can acquire a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Used these blades before and really like them.</li>
            <li>I use them to shave my head and a straight razor on my face</li>
            <li>For face shaving I recommend staying with the stainless blades, but for my head shaves, these seem to cause fewer scalp nicks.</li>
            <li>just be careful when you shave with those :)</li>
            <li>Cheap enough to throw away after a use or two as well!</li>
            <li>In fact, the edges are numbered and can be rotated four times -- each edge of each side -- if you really want to stretch them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start with this: I think razor blade reviews can be very misleading.</li>
            <li>very  close shave</li>
            <li>would recommend getting Cremo  Cream  works very well for a  close shave.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Quattro gives a very close shave but the Derby blade in the Edwin Jagger beats it.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in nicks, being every so often.</li>
            <li>If you are paying $8+ for 4 cartridges of those &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors, you are absolutely being ripped off.  </li>
            <li>and you will be amazed at how much money you are saving.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>They cut well, wonder if the feather&#x27;s will be to much for my skin.</li>
            <li>, I shave daily, and I lather and shave lightly 3 times each shaving session.  </li>
            <li>The blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, all contained in a box, and if my beard was a bit softer, they would be an absolute steal of a deal.</li>
            <li>The price of 100 is so much cheaper than the Mach III that I was suing before along with giving me no razor burns.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>, they work very well.</li>
            <li>I use these when I&#x27;m rushed and need a very forgiving blade.</li>
            <li>Saves so much money.</li>
            <li>Plus since I dont re-use the blades, my face doesnt break out as much.</li>
            <li>I have very course hair</li>
            <li>I feel these blades give not only a close shave but a comfortable one as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Up til now the only time i have ever had a baby smooth shave was at the barber.</li>
            <li>These last two being as important for me as the blades.</li>
            <li>Some are very aggressive and some are very relaxed.  </li>
            <li>but these are a very close (pun intended</li>
            <li>That is why it is so important to try different blades, aftershaves, etc.</li>
            <li>A real winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Straight edges with no Burrs.  </li>
            <li>How much would someone spend on Mach III cartridges in the course of a year?</li>
            <li>I really like the Derby blades.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the savings over the course of a year.</li>
            <li>They are also very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is why I really like the Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Want better..buy a straight razor..</li>
            <li>Very forgiving.</li>
            <li>If I ever run out of these, haha, I&#x27;ll stick with Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Now I know that everyone is different, but these blades are forgiving and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I started off with Merkur which gave me a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>Stick with Feather blades because these do not cut very well.</li>
            <li>One problem I had, was the pack of 100 arrived with the top of the package crushed, and 5 of the plastic packets inside were severly damaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot tell much difference.</li>
            <li>It looks like it is going to be about a while before I can really compare blades</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know - these are all I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>These blades are very forgiving...</li>
            <li>It takes several passes to get a smooth shave</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really all a matter of perfecting my stroke...</li>
            <li>At the same time, these are cheap blades</li>
            <li>A pack of 100 blades really is a quarter of a year supply with a beard like mine.</li>
            <li>They probably could have lasted longer but at the price, I really don&#x27;t see a reason to continue using a blade after a week.</li>
            <li>But I suspect people who never learned to shave properly and have been using modern tech type razors, that are far more forgiving, you may have problems.  </li>
            <li>&quot; videos on You Tube before trying anything like these real blades.</li>
            <li>Some may even need sharper ones out there but its really a matter of preference, beard thickness and depends on the type of skin</li>
            <li>When I retired from the military I was able to let my beard grow for a change.  </li>
            <li>I wish the blades were sharper as I have to make three passes to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rust as fast as the Sharks, for that matter.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Scored the whole box for $5 on sale too.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the blades, with light stropping, give me two solid weeks of close shaves.</li>
            <li>Each face &amp; attitude differs, so it&#x27;s really subjective, relative&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for providing&lt;br /&gt;them @</li>
            <li>They would probably last for 3 or 5 shaves, but they are so cheap</li>
            <li>much sharper and a cleaner cut.</li>
            <li>I even use it for my own womanly purposes and I haven&#x27;t had a shave like that from regular razors.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson Sword is a bit better in that they will last me nearly a week, but not quite as smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as with most razors, they&#x27;re harsh fresh.</li>
            <li>Not sharp enought to complete a full face shave!  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly coarse beard with sensitive fair Irish skin.  </li>
            <li>As I am using double edge safety razor for the first time, I found the razor is mild and a second pass against the grain will give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mild blade that doesn&#x27;t dull too quickly for me, I am getting 3 shaves per side, or a total of six shaves per blade</li>
            <li>These Derby Extra blades have a coating of platinum, chromium, tungsten and other polymers to make the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li>These blades are super cheap and sharp!  </li>
            <li>I find these blades to be a good value for the price and also fairly similar to other blades I have used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its my razor or these blades, but while one side gives a nice shave the other side sits too far off the face.</li>
            <li>The head is heavy enough to give a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and can be used for at least 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the prompt service and an awesome</li>
            <li>You may have to try blades from different makers to find one that&#x27;s right for your face - these are right for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never gotten a nick on my face (have to be much more careful when I shave my head!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t change blades more often, or longer, but think about it , what a bargain!</li>
            <li>Like many of you I tried some other brands, e.g. Merkur and Astra blades</li>
            <li>I like these much better than Shark or other blades</li>
            <li>I ordered these when I started DE shaving and they were okay but seems not as sharp as they could be.</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s are my favorite because they are not as ninja sharp as feather&#x27;s or merkur&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I also feel like these give me razor burn much more than other razors.</li>
            <li>Are there better DE blades out there by other manufacturers?  </li>
            <li>but they do irritate my face if i do not shave more then every other day.</li>
            <li>and somedays the blades work better then other days.</li>
            <li>The blades last about a week long and work as good as any other name brand that I can find, if you use a old safety razor these fit the bill!</li>
            <li>Better than Astra, Shark and some other brand I tried.</li>
            <li>This proved to be true, but even as I&#x27;ve gotten better, I&#x27;m still having a hard time with these blades.  </li>
            <li>Short of a cut-throat razor, I&#x27;ve never had this clean a shave before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to get a clean shave on him, and each blade seems to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard of others like the BIC or Red Persona an Israeli company that makes middle of the road blades are suitable for people who may have thicker beards.  </li>
            <li>When buying in this kind of bulk, you will have enough blades for a long time, and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They do an adequate job of shaving, but after about three days of usage, they seem to miss a lot of spots.. they&#x27;re certainly inexpensive enough to replace every three days -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t nick easily on the first shave like the sharpest, higher-end blades sometimes do, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dull quickly either.  </li>
            <li>Great razor blades, very sharp, be careful /</li>
            <li>These razors are very sharp and give a very smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Super cheap if you&#x27;re not trying to waste money on Gillette cartridge razors</li>
            <li>It is not easy to find this kind a baled any more at your local drugstore or the big name cvs and walgreens.  </li>
            <li>These blades work very nice, but keep in mind they are not known as being as sharp as other blades.</li>
            <li>I got these a long with a Lord razor and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear.</li>
            <li>These blades are fair for the first shave but don&#x27;t make it much past the third</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using DE blades for about 6 mos after 30 years with various more &#x27;modern&#x27; cartridge style blades.</li>
            <li>Derby seems very middle of the road and left me with a good shave without the occasional nick.</li>
            <li>With modern Bonded Blades costing so much shaving with an old fashion safety razor using the Derby Blades is a real cost saver.</li>
            <li>The reason I have given them 5 stars is that I have a full beard and extremely coarse hair</li>
            <li>Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave, and I have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>They are not dull, but the Astra blades I bought were much nicer.</li>
            <li>Derby is hands down my favorite blade.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that they dont have the closest shave and tug a little bit at my hair but other than that they work great!</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use they are still shaper and smoother than a new Gillette out of the box!</li>
            <li>At this price, I can pretend I am a millionaire and use a new blade with each shave!  </li>
            <li>- see you in two years when I need to order a new supply!</li>
            <li>New people to DE shaving should not rate these blades until they have had enough time to become familiar with the shaving technique.</li>
            <li>Derby razor blades are a super buy, and are super sharp!  </li>
            <li>Feather - Very sharp but seemed to make me take more passes to get all the beard cut.  </li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t use them for more than 2 shaves, but I have very thick stubble and very soft skin that cuts easy, so you may get more use than I</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable ( no pulling, almost no cuts), very close, long lasting shave.</li>
            <li>100 blades of this quality for such a small price, simply amazing!</li>
            <li>, they Irritate my skin a slight bit more than Wilkinson.  </li>
            <li>Just this morning I switched to a Wilkinson Sword Blade and I have to say the shave was noticeably better, and the irritation was noticeably less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that gets slightly closer, more nicks, with 8-10 shaves per blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sort of banking on it to start shaving with a decent soap, and had to rely on my shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I thought I found a decent Derby blade among the bunch, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li>They gave me more nicks and an overall rougher shave than the personna and gillete 7 o&#x27;clock yellow blades, which are my favorites</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to shave with these more than once or twice before shaving goes from uncomfortable to downright intolerable.</li>
            <li>I purchased some Wilkinson Sword blades, which are about 50% more expensive, and got a much better shave.</li>
            <li>After you buy a decent safety razor, I guess you can save money using these blades.</li>
            <li>Derby blades seem to be of decent quality, and for someone with a lighter beard than mine</li>
            <li>This combination is a great for beginners but always shave slowly, let the weight of DE89Lbl do the work and in short stroke.</li>
            <li>They give me a decent shave without nicking or irritation.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as a first blade to use for the first timer like me.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this stick of 100 will last me a couple of years for the cost of two premium multi-blade cartridges that will last me at most two weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive razors, but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>And the blades will most likely last me a year!  </li>
            <li>this is a lot better than paying $25 for four of those 5 blade razors that only last one shave.</li>
            <li>Best deal around I have to shave everyday for work with the blades I save at least 10 dollars per week</li>
            <li>If not I will go back to the merkur super.</li>
            <li>its just a couple of bucks more expensive, go with a better quality razor.</li>
            <li>These will be my main blades now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the blades were damaged as a result of this, as I haven&#x27;t tried those particular blades as yet.</li>
            <li>I agree with many others that getting the correct wet shave is trial &amp; error marked with some blood sacrifice.</li>
            <li>All these blades were decent and did the job</li>
            <li>Some blades in the pack were great and lasted up to 2 weeks, but others were a bit rough after a few days.</li>
            <li>These blades are good for my sensitive skin and and since I don&#x27;t have a thick beard - it suits my needs.  </li>
            <li>They are not the sharpest blade I have encountered but give a very smooth shave with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li>have a 24 pack of derby&#x27;s and a 4 pack of shark super stainless that I would like to trade for any other brand if anybody is interested.</li>
            <li>It is safe to say I have a pretty thick bear, and even after a few days of not shaving at all, these razors &#x27;wipe&#x27; the hair off very easily.</li>
            <li>A great alternate to the very expensive disposable blades most guys buy.</li>
            <li>Love this blade new to the DE community and is only the 2nd I&#x27;ve tried next to shark super chrome.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I switched from high priced razors to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>and it was highly rated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I can get at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaving for one blade by making sure to clean the blade and all the shaver parts and then dry them.  </li>
            <li>If you have started using a safety razor I highly recommend trying these blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I can get a BBM shave readily with three light passes and a few advanced passes over key areas.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I further read where it would be better to get a 100 pack of blades of only one brand and work on your shaving technique as you are new to this type of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this is very similar performance to all other brands I have tried</li>
            <li>I guess my face and neck are more sensitive than other guys.  </li>
            <li>They are very smooth, without nicks or cuts... and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I believe that these particular razor blades last much longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried; however, they&#x27;re priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>The 200 count is a little better buy.</li>
            <li>I now get 100 blades for just a little more than I used to pay for 10 blades.</li>
            <li>They last just as long, are sharp, and feel great.</li>
            <li>Better then merkur by a little.</li>
            <li>The blades barely cut through my wife&#x27;s baby fine leg hair, and gave her all-over shave burn she hasn&#x27;t had in years using a properly shaped double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use  </li>
            <li>I will also say that these blades are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Merkurs are good but dull too quick and Feathers are too sharp for me and result in razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why some people gave these blades a bad rating, I think they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>shave with a &amp;#34;Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The old school razor works just as well as the modern 4 blade cartridges and the blades</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a very well trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li>Better buying these then the 2 pack for nearly the same price and only 10 blades.</li>
            <li>I normally get 3-4 days out of each blade.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the flip side is that they won&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as some more aggressive blades, but a &amp;#34;closer shave&amp;#34; will look like this one in a few hours anyway, so it isn&#x27;t the biggest deal.</li>
            <li>I usually get a couple good shaves out of each one as I do with any double edge blades.</li>
            <li>I shaved like I normally would, up/down and sideways.  </li>
            <li>I STARTED USING FEATHERS, BUT I SUFFERED TOO MANY SKIN IRRITATIONS AND NICKS IN THE TROUBLE AREAS.</li>
            <li>I am able to get four shaves per blade and have what is considered a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>When letting it go for too long for 5 or more days, the double, triple and even the quadruple bladed cartridges razors could not cut through the forrest.  </li>
            <li>The normal techniques didn’t work well</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;ve got a fairly normal beard</li>
            <li>Provides a good shave, but not a great one.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t my favorite blades because I prefer a very sharp one, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and these seemed to get high reviews for the price.  </li>
            <li>Too dull for my face, but they&#x27;re SUPER cheap if they work for you.</li>
            <li>In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li>After testing several other more expensive brands, I found that inexpensive Derby was the best and longest lasting blade.  </li>
            <li>they are not dull, but the packaging is overly conservative on the part of safety.</li>
            <li>The blades come in smaller packs inside the box, so easy to store in our tiny bathroom, in the medicine chest.</li>
            <li>Be careful how you dispose of old blades, as they can easily slice through trash bags and cut someone.  </li>
            <li>They went right back to Amazon.</li>
            <li>and he has to get rid of it right away and go to the next one in the box.</li>
            <li>I can easily cut the neck hair in 5 strokes at most and the blade just feels less harsh than the Derby.</li>
            <li>These blades are stunningly sharp and give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The Derby&#x27;s on the other hand are plenty sharp and glide across my face leaving a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>There is no denying that this is cheap, but I was hoping them to be a little bit sharper since it doesn&#x27;t really give me that close of a shave.</li>
            <li>Not all are smooth and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I save the original wrapping for disposal as I have curious cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades are smooth, sharp, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and comfortable to shave.</li>
            <li>This blade is not as sharp as some others, which may suit your needs if you have light to medium growth or are learning how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li>but it must just be because i live in michigan.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still trying out new blades.</li>
            <li>my new choice of razor blade/ shaving system..</li>
            <li>I use a new blade every Monday morning.  </li>
            <li>got these for his new razor to keep him well shaved</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to De razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this blade to anyone who is new to safety razors.  </li>
            <li>so going to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blade.</li>
            <li>New to Safety Razors and just went with these as part of a suggestion package.  </li>
            <li>someone new to DE shaving</li>
            <li>I use them about twice (to shave my legs) and then switch it out for a new one...</li>
            <li>but when delivered don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly new to DE shaving</li>
            <li>My new DE shaver included a starter pack of these blades.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend that if you&#x27;re new to shaving you try a variety pack...</li>
            <li>But, lets face it, for the price, you could use a brand new razor every time you shave.</li>
            <li>During the summer, I shave my arms, legs and chest, and I can get away with using a blade one time on my legs and a new blade each time I shave my arms and chest.</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t work as well new.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brand again.</li>
            <li>I just grab a new one every time.</li>
            <li>so I can just grab a new 5 pack out from under the sink whenever</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>These blades do a good job, but they seem to dull faster then the Shark Double Edge blades I used up.</li>
            <li>The key with these babies is to change the blades every day (which I certainly don&#x27;t mind doing for the price!).  </li>
            <li>that I bought such a large amount of them!  </li>
            <li>The Derby blades are easy on my skin, with much less irritation than the cartridge blades, and work well in both razors, though I favor the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>The Derbys are very forgiving and gave me the same quality, close shave that i get with the Feather blades but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A Derby Extra razor blade was included free with my recently purchased Muhle R41 safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The second and third shave was fantastic.</li>
            <li>, this pack of blades will easily last a year; and if you use proper technique (wet-shaving with soap and brush, not with canned foam), you will get as close and comfortable a shave as with any multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>Double edge blades are no longer available in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I went back to a double edge razor and a good brush, shaving mug and Mama Bear brand soaps about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li>At the price, compared to plastic razors, this singular purchase has saved me enough to make the conversion to wet shaving a money saving plan (and a better shave)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None however will get 1 star as its such a personal fit</li>
            <li>Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  </li>
            <li>Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  </li>
            <li>these blades are really good as long as you use proper shave soap and keep your face wet!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive  skin and want a bbs  shave.</li>
            <li>This was a terrific deal ,very economic.</li>
            <li>If you are young and no one ever taught you how to shave properly, I highly recommend you watch some \\&quot;how to\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having a very coarse beard, I like a more aggressive razor such as a Gillette red tip, with a sharp blade for light strokes.</li>
            <li>this is a very dull blade was not as smooth clean cut as i thought</li>
            <li>the many good reviews, I wonder whether I simply got a bad batch or whether this company spends</li>
            <li>Sure, some of the other blades I tried seemed sharper but that was of no benefit and the only time I have ever had a nick/cut from shaving was from those blades.</li>
            <li>People usually say how many shaves a blade lasts for.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of reading on blades before settling on these as my first double edge bade to start shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>By far, the sharpest blades I have ever had in 40 years!  </li>
            <li>I still have many of the other blades left</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Asian American (so you better understand the facial hair).</li>
            <li>First box of razors I&#x27;ve purchased for traditional shaving</li>
            <li>Only on my first one.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson - cut myself 3 times on the first shave and twice on the second shave.  </li>
            <li>In the past, this would lead to razor burn and more nicks, but I&#x27;ve not had that problem with these razor blades.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying smaller batch first.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I actually prefer a hot washcloth.  </li>
            <li>My priorities in a blade are skin protection first, cut whiskers second.  </li>
            <li>Good all round blade for someone just starting out on DE shaving, but order a sample pack with different blades to try before you order 100 blades.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stay sharp longer than a few uses save your money buy a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>Cheap and sharp!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-The blades are sharp and provide a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My father complemented me on my clean shave the other day.</li>
            <li>I realize different people have different shaving styles and different faces, but I can only rate these on my own experience, and I don&#x27;t plan on buying again.</li>
            <li>Not to the point where they are unusable, but a marked difference in shave quality from a new blade.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying derby blades remember they are one of the less aggressive blades available, so</li>
            <li>At a bulk price of less than 10 cents per blade, they are as close to free as you will ever get.  </li>
            <li>Cause irritation and dulls quickly</li>
            <li>Being a life long DE wet shaver, I have tried many blades.</li>
            <li>I for one normally get at least 4 shaves out of one blade, and even then I could probably get two more if I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that tends to have razor bumps so far no issue.</li>
            <li>Good bade for everyday use or beginning the wet shave experience!!</li>
            <li>when you can spend less than $8.00 and get a high quality shave for almost a full year.</li>
            <li>That first box of 100 blades lasted for nearly four years, much longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very sharp and they served their purpose - an opportunity for me to learn how to shave safely with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Never the less, I tried the others just to be sure and the blade that I keep going back to is the Derby.</li>
            <li>If I make sure to dry off the blade well, and don&#x27;t make a bunch of extra passes trying to get difficult areas super smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought a sample pack of various manufacturers several months ago to try in my 60&#x27;s Super Speed.</li>
            <li>One thing that did help him tremendously in the beginning was watching a YouTube video on how to shave properly with a safety razor (the technique is different from a throw away).  </li>
            <li>I love the Derby&#x27;s--not too dull , not too sharp, but just right!</li>
            <li>Also quite environmentally friendly packaging compared to other disposable cartridges!</li>
            <li>For those given to worrying about the environment or just wishing to live more simply, the method just described produces no non-recyclable waste.  </li>
            <li>every few shaves, these work just fine.</li>
            <li>Not sure how other people write good reviews...</li>
            <li>I have to use certain facial lotions</li>
            <li>The cost of these blades have certainly saved me over $100 in traditional cartridge blades.</li>
            <li>After a few shaves in, I grew so fed up with the Feathers that mid-shave I actually swapped to my last Derby blade, and finished up with no problems and super smooth</li>
            <li>Too dull for me and leaves too many nicks.</li>
            <li>I use a Merkur Classic DE Razor and either Proraso, Colonel Conk or a locally made vegetarian shave soap, an Omega badger hair brush and try to shave only after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s hard to argue with 100 blades for under $8), but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave as well.  </li>
            <li>Bit too dull for my Edwin Jagger DE razor - nice blade but not for me personally.</li>
            <li>I am totally new to DE shaving, but after reading and researching for hours on all this new-fangled old fashioned shaving stuff, I finally settled on asking for this particular blade as a gift to go with the Edwin Jagger DE87 on my gift list.  </li>
            <li>The hair on one&#x27;s head is typically much finer than that of a beard, so the blades last far longer for that than they ever did with my face.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s got a thick, heavy beard, so anything that can stand up to that is a GREAT razor.</li>
            <li>Derby Extra is working very well in my Merkur 38D.</li>
            <li>Started using an Old Timer razor and after checking out reviews on Amazon, I went with these.</li>
            <li>I bought an old fashioned handle and put these blades in.  </li>
            <li>I really like the shave they provide and will stick with these blades for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I am feeling like these are giving me a shave of about the same quality as a straight razor shave for me.</li>
            <li>At 56 years old, and shaving for 40 years I learned that DO NOT GET</li>
            <li>I have the dreaded combination of ultra sensitive skin and stubble with the consistency of steel wool.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I realized that once I made the initial investment in a safety razor, it would be much cheaper to buy double-edged replacement blades for it than to continue to buy the disposable shavers that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through three razors so far</li>
            <li>but I prefer this one as it fits my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with a safety razor for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much cheaper than buying regular razor sets.</li>
            <li>They were supposed to provide a very close shave with fewer passes (With the Derby&#x27;s I was going with the grain, across then against to achieve relatively close to BBS)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, After much research, I&#x27;m using the Derbys at a rate of one a week.</li>
            <li>OK, so we&#x27;re not dealing with complex equipment.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>WoW......</li>
            <li>so far has lasted my 6 shaves (about a month)</li>
            <li>I went straight to these with shaving soap, and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li>far the one blade I have loaded into my Gillette has lasted me for about eight shaves.</li>
            <li>I shave sporadically, so I go from smooth to scruffy, every few days.  </li>
            <li>Get these blades and convert to old school shaving.</li>
            <li>On my 3rd shave I attained BBS on my cheeks and very close to BBS below my neck.  </li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>The blades that came with my razor are lasting very well</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Thanks to the exorbitant cost of blades for Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 and Quattro I decided to return to a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still saving considerable money over the cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really now, how can they make such a precision product at under 8 cents a blade, sharpened, wrapped, packaged, and labeled?</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and purchased these after using up some Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>Prepare shave to make it soft and raised.  </li>
            <li>These blades do the trick for my hyper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The shaver is able to make several passes over the same areas with minimal to zero irritation.</li>
            <li>I then purchased a Merkur 34C HD and removed the blade from the old razor and put it into the Merkur, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>very satisfed with them equal to if not exceeding  wilkinson&#x27;s</li>
            <li>takes some patience to get a shave if you do not prep by unboxing and unboxing and doing at least one more</li>
            <li>Every blade is packaged separately and wrapper can be used to dispose old blade.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to others looking to complete their shaving experience.</li>
            <li>If your looking to get into straight razor shaving (which uses double edge safety blades) or safety razor shaving this is recommended.</li>
            <li>and I have to tell by far the feather edge holds for longer and shaves smoother,</li>
            <li>The last time I used a straight raiser was when I was a teenager going through my grandfather&#x27;s bathroom drawers looking for a razor to shave.  </li>
            <li>I am getting the closest shave doing the old fashioned technique of shaving than I have ever gotten before in my life.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a ton of facial hair</li>
            <li>Arrived 5 days early.</li>
            <li>EVEN THOSE TOOK TOO MUCH SKIN OFF AFTER MULTIPLE PASSES.</li>
            <li>TO STICK WITH THEM BECAUSE MY SKIN IS TOO SENSITIVE FOR THE SHARPEST BLADES</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband, and so far he has had no complaints.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three brands of DE blade from Amazon so far, and these are by far my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>Yes I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>tried these blades on 3 different safety razors - e.g., the very forgiving Merkur 34C.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s different, but these work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use an old glass jelly jar.  </li>
            <li>but the Derby blades were my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>The blades are individually wrapped in 5-pack plastic holders which makes them really convenient for travelling.</li>
            <li>After 15 years away from the DE scene I recently went back to it, partly to save my aged, sun damaged skin from the multi-blade scraping of cartridge razors and partly because I just couldn&#x27;t see the value in $16.95 for 5 more cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I found my grandpas&#x27; old clam razor.  </li>
            <li>Saves a lot of money as compared to the price of the standard modern razor.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And you will be doing it the old style.</li>
            <li>They maintain a good edge and one blade, properly cleaned, will last for at least a week or longer.  </li>
            <li>but if I cut myself all the time what good is it.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to stick to the more expensive blades, at least I save on bandages.</li>
            <li>buy these with a safety razor, and you will have long time supply of good blades; these come in individual plastic containers ( each with a small number of blades.)</li>
            <li>This is a year worth of smooth shaving for less than $10!!!!.</li>
            <li>but I usually shave with a new one every time since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>But they aren&#x27;t overly scalpel sharp to where I worry about putting them next to my soft, fragile, handsome face.  </li>
            <li>Basically over two years of good quality shaving for less than one small package of disposable, environmentally traitorous disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp or long-lasting as Feather, but they are more forgiving of poor technique or bumpy skin and produce a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cut and dry product here.</li>
            <li>I have been using my razor for about 2 weeks, I used one blade for about 2 weeks now and still have the one, they might be cheap but they sure last long, I shave every day, and my hair is thick, totally recommend this blades...</li>
            <li>must say, though, that to get the super close shave that I like, with any setup, I have to use my free hand to feel for rough patches, reapply soap, pull the skin tight, and then work those areas in multiple directions/</li>
            <li>it will keep the blades clean of bacteria and will be less chances of acne, DE razor shaving removes dead skin clean your blades and they will last derby  blades prices are unbeatable and to me they arr the exact same as feather</li>
            <li>These caused the least irritation and cut very easily even on the second stroke.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t take the time to review Amazon products, but I felt that this was good enough to break me from my stereotypical apathy.</li>
            <li>Previously I have been able to get a week of shaves with a single razor</li>
            <li>I am new to double edge saftey razor shaving and so far it has been a blast shaving !</li>
            <li>I just felt they weren&#x27;t very sharp and didn&#x27;t last more than one shave on my 20 grit facial hair....</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last as long as murkur razors but at this price you can afford to use a fresh one for each shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone, as they last longer and seem to cut better than any disposable I&#x27;ve ever used, along with being a small fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First pass with the grain, second pass across the grain, and third pass against the grain.</li>
            <li>When I initially started shaving with Double edge razor blades, I bought several sampler packs (which have a bunch of different brands) and spent a lot of time deciding which brand I liked.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent deal.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews of assorted blades and it seems each handle/blade combination works differently with each unique beard.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still not half way through this pack.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of blades, made necessary by the diminishing supply of blades from my initial kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>use each blade only once, not sure how many times you can, in theory, use each.</li>
            <li>I also heat a mug of water as my tap water meets the current building code for temperature, which means it isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>razor is forgiving enough that you won&#x27;t cut yourself if you press a little too hard, but is still sharp enough to give you a very nice tug free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you choose sharper blades such as with Japanese Feather blades - super sharp - you will slice your face up unless you experience with DE blades and know how to use your technique very well.</li>
            <li>However after shaving with Feathers for a couple of weeks and switching to the Derby&#x27;s last week I can say for sure that these blades are just as good for me as the Feathers are (with the added bonus of being even less expensive!)</li>
            <li>The variables are endless and find the right combination is trial and error.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taking into account the low price, I would highly recommend these razors.</li>
            <li>However, I switched to personna blades which are more expensive, but they are much sharper and seem to last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps razor blades were proportionally more expensive back in the 20s or 30s; perhaps, however, they never sold really well and were an old-fashioned version of the modern contraptions you see on midnight infomercials</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says he highly recommends them to anyone who uses double edge razors!</li>
            <li>They are very sharp but smooth and forgiving at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have an old Gillette Ball-End razor, but also bought a new Merkur HD, and also the Derby blades based on reading about various blades on line.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave very little nicks or cuts</li>
            <li>Hubby shaves three times going in different directions and has a very close, smooth shave (and he has a thick beard).  </li>
            <li>, then the fourth shave I sometimes have to change out mid shave because it is not cutting well enough.</li>
            <li>Compare the price of these to a normal replaceable blade schick or gillette for the same amount of time!</li>
            <li>So sharp in fact that left my sensitive face and neck smooth but extremely red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>these blades are alright, ive gone through about 15 of them now, and i can use them for about 2 shaves per blade normally flipping the blade for the second shave.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves were extremely sharp, and each one lasted a full week of daily shaving.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected based on the review I read before the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Those with thick, full bears might want to trim first or just get a different blade altogether.</li>
            <li>I ordered these along with an Edwin jagger de89lbl and Taylor of old bond street sandlewood shaving cream they are very sharp and get the job done right.</li>
            <li>They will last a long time before I have to buy more and really sharp!</li>
            <li>Ok, after all the hype I&#x27;ve read about the exotic expensive blades, I bought a major sampling to see what I had been missing.</li>
            <li>They have a very smooth cutting edge compared to other blades( particularly the Merkur blade that has a sandpaper like edge) , thus the provide a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive been using safety razors for the last several years and have finally found the right razor blade.</li>
            <li>While they all easily outperform every commercial market razor blade (the disposable cartridges with 4-5 dull blades type) out there, the DE razor blade types certainly can be a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about beard reduction with each easy pass (rather than beard removal in one chiselfest), going with the grain, and not pressing hard on your skin.</li>
            <li>Each one is individually packed in a set of 5 in a hard plastic case, much better than what I had before.  </li>
            <li>and get a new one for the next shave.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing a sampler pack if you are new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving</li>
            <li>Bought these for my husband and his new double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Those of you that are new at wetshaving or shaving with a safety razor must know that blades work differently for everyone.  </li>
            <li>Nothing gets a closer shave for my face than a brand new Derby Extra.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my mach III before the new blades arrived from Japan.  </li>
            <li>get a variety pack if your new to double edges.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a new blade as often as others and each blade can last around 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, I can live with tossing 1 out of every 10 blades within a week.</li>
            <li>find when the blade is fresh, the first usage causes me a couple of cuts it is so sharp I would say almost too sharp!</li>
            <li>I really like these blades after not using a double edge razor since I was in basic training in 1967.</li>
            <li>All I can think is their beards are wispy soft blonde angel hair, because these things cut like a 4 year old Feather blade after 300 shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically you get a decades worth for less than $10.</li>
            <li>Thus far,  I have sampled the following razors:  Personna - decent shave but not the sharpest though they last about a week before there is a noticeable drop in performance.  </li>
            <li>They may not work for super heavy beards, but for my not so heavy facial hair gets shaved off smoothly and without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately before buying read only the good reviews.</li>
            <li>blades themselves are just dull enough to allow for varied pressure but not sharp enough to shave cleanly in the first pass.</li>
            <li>Switched to single razor and now i shave every day no razor burn plus so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with a single pass, no irritation, no nicks or cuts, no reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li>One of the edges is completely fine, but the other is rough and chafing.</li>
            <li>These work fine though they dull after 4-5 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if they dont work well for you, you can do like I do and keep them as back ups for when you unexpectedly run out of blades!</li>
            <li>They are decently sharp and do exactly as needed when you pop them in.  </li>
            <li>They feel sturdy and are sharp, which is exactly what I need in a razor.</li>
            <li>but believe you me, these blades can still cut you if not careful!</li>
            <li>These blades are super dull, they constantly wear out quick and pull on the regular, spend the extra money on feather or astra.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp enough to cut me, but not sharp enough to cleanly shave.</li>
            <li>In less than one year, I have gone through more than half of the blades in the box.</li>
            <li>I have a coarse heavy beard that requires daily shaving and after even several days of neglect, the Derby&#x27;s cut right through it smoothly with no difficulties or drag.</li>
            <li>I do not have a strong beard and this is the first time that I encounter new blades pulling rather than cutting hair.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, they cut down hairs with a smooth finesse, and they&#x27;re far cheaper than cartridges.</li>
            <li>These blades are like the long handled axe a lumberjack uses to strike hard, blunt, and clean to chop down that mighty oak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my facial hair is not very thick; I&#x27;m 18 years old and my facial hair is still thickening.</li>
            <li>I actually think each blade would last longer than 1 week, but since they are so cheap I figure why not splurge a little, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can live with a little tug and pull as long as I&#x27;m getting clean and irritation-free daily shaves.</li>
            <li>They shave fine, my only complaint would be that they get dull very quickly.</li>
            <li>Get an occasional bad one but for the most part I enjoy these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What may be helpful for people in general is to try is a sampler pack, which you can find online by searching for DE Blade Sampler Packs.  </li>
            <li>Balanced, plenty sharp for a comfortable shave, but not tooo sharp.  </li>
            <li>Last as long as the expensive german blades, at a great price.</li>
            <li>It could be my facial hair, it could be my razor, but so far I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly sensitive face, and these blades last me</li>
            <li>But for kicks one day in the store I decided to try a pack of regular old Wilkinson blades from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I have used this blade for only two shaves so far.</li>
            <li>I have a medium coarse beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Of course, I haven&#x27;t tested all 100 of them, but all of the nine or ten I have tried so far have been defective.</li>
            <li>I am 61 yrs old &amp; started shaving with double edge razors.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Lords trio of blades, and found them all to give me a shave that wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as the Derby, and they always left razor rash.</li>
            <li>but for a beginner wet shaver they&#x27;re very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>I can barely feel the blade removing my beard...</li>
            <li>I have only used one of these blades so far</li>
            <li>These were the first blades I ever bought when I started wet shaving with a double edged razor, and in all honesty, I have never used another brand.</li>
            <li>Among these, derby is the worst by far and astras are by far the best for my face.</li>
            <li>blades were okay for some areas of my face, but I&#x27;d get an average of 3-5 cuts per pass in my trouble areas...</li>
            <li>I would like to say if the blades themselves are better or worse than others.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp.</li>
            <li>They offer a consistent product that hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li>On the standard of one blade a week (you may use more or less I suppose), I figure I&#x27;ve got about two years of shaves for less than $15.00.  </li>
            <li>While they are slightly flimsy, once you put it in your safety razor it will not be evident anymore.</li>
            <li>Have used Wilkinson Sword in the past and these blade are not as sharp, however the trade off is that I can be more agressive when shaving.</li>
            <li>They are sharp enough for a pretty close shave, and at this price, you can toss after a couple shaves without wasting tons of money.</li>
            <li>Using these with the traditional safety razor for the first time i cut myself a lot, and these blades were so i sharp</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and really really sharp.</li>
            <li>I have said in other reviews, blade reviews are very subjective and</li>
            <li>Really flimsy compared to every other blade I have tried.</li>
            <li>TL;DR: Cheap and plentiful blades to learn with, but not very sharp and won&#x27;t last for thick</li>
            <li>They last a good long time but won&#x27;t cut you to peaces if you press just a little too hard, either.</li>
            <li>you have coarse facial hair, steer clear of these blades.</li>
            <li>My 2nd favorite blades behind Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li>Blades are not sharp enough even for one time use.</li>
            <li>These blades were not sharp enough to give me a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>I would use them again if I had them and no other blades, but would not likely ever purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is likely not due to the fact that the blade is super sharp because compared to all other it is not.  </li>
            <li>Second, right out the box it felt like I was shaving with a butter knife, and my beard isnt that heavy.</li>
            <li>While I get done faster with the Feather, I don&#x27;t actually get a closer shave, and generally do get irritation.</li>
            <li>One side of the blade is marked 1,2 and the other side is marked 3,4, so you can rotate the side of the blade used.  </li>
            <li>my drug store barely stocks double edge blades never in these quantity stock up save money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 5 blades so far in about 3 months shaving every 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
            <li>So I bought an old school double edge razor and a big box of Derby Extra blades.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money and purchase higher quality blades.</li>
            <li>I have bought half a dozen razor blades to test before I bought a large quantity.  </li>
            <li>These blades are sharp and have a decent life.</li>
            <li>I find these to be sharp enough to give a close shave on a daily basis but not irritating after 2 separate passes in the morning.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely sharp, last a long time, and the price for the quantity can&#x27;t really be beat!</li>
            <li>These are the only blades I have / tried using for a double edge razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other</li>
            <li>Be careful if you are new to using these, they take some getting used to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving then you may want to start with these blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>High quality product which stays sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what you can do with the cash saved just from not having to buy ridiculously expensive razors all year long.</li>
            <li>Then I started breaking them in half and using them with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>100 blades for less than the cost of two on the modern blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>The blades are reasonably priced less than 10 cents a blade.</li>
            <li>I generally shave twice with them, in opposite directions for an extra close shave.</li>
            <li>The sampler also included two Feather blades which were extremely sharp and difficult to use no matter how careful I was,would not recommend the &amp;#34;Feather Double Edge&amp;#34; .I also purchased the Mekur  double edge razor (on Amazon) great razor.</li>
            <li>I normally buy Wilkinson Sword blades, Derbys cut way easier, however being that they are that sharp</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something more, not sure who to blame (Derby, Amazon or the import service / UPS ) but the package end up missing 10 blades ( 2 sets of 5 ) not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Wet shavers new to double edge shaving should use these blades a their starter blade.</li>
            <li>I tried several different blades, including but not limited to Astra, Wilkinson sword, Feather and 2 off brands.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these blades are fine!</li>
            <li>This is sharp enough to give me that smooth shave but isn&#x27;t aggressive enough to scrape my skin raw.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a more relaxing shave as you&#x27;re not typically anxious about cutting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only less wasteful method is with a straight razor, but the learning curve is simply too steep for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the little cartridge to hold my used blades.</li>
            <li>for the blade, you get a very close shave with little to no irritation on the skin when doing a three shave pass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be much happier if those 5 packs were sub-packed into little cardboard</li>
            <li>I shave every other day and install a new blade every Monday morning</li>
            <li>I have always noticed that sharp new cartridge razors would irritate my neck, but would not once the razor was a bit used/dulled.</li>
            <li>I can not compare these to the other brands out there, however I have not had to order any new blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave as often as some others do.</li>
            <li>How can a company that makes such a fine product have such poor quality control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard, so it&#x27;s important I can run the blade over my face several times.</li>
            <li>This blade was very widely used by new shavers.</li>
            <li>nothing worse than a dull razor blade...and a good razor</li>
            <li>Even if they cut you it won&#x27;t hurt, which is either Good or bad</li>
            <li>They seem to be either all good or all bad, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return these.</li>

            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> but these are just as good.</li>
            <li> Forgiving if you make a mistake, but require perfect technique if you want a completely smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good razor and a good value.</li>
            <li> Good for 3-4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 3 weeks now and have gotten good performance from them.</li>
            <li> good shaves from each blade</li>
            <li> All in all, a good purchase; this is something that I would (and probably will) buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of irritation and weeping despite good prep and technique.  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Good blades for entry into world of double-edged shaving.  </li>
            <li> but these are good value.</li>
            <li> Its a good deal for a lot of razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These &#x27;Derby&#x27; blades are good for me for 3 shaves before they start to pull, meaning they need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> That is really good value since that is all I get from a Feather too</li>
            <li> Good blades for a good price.</li>
            <li> A perfect smooth shave with the feel of hair being cut rather than torn.</li>
            <li> I change the blade about every 5th shave, so this box should be good for about 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a good razor to hold them.  </li>
            <li> I have a Parker, but I hear Merkur is good too.</li>
            <li> It still makes me feel good.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> They are not my favorites but they give a good shave..</li>
            <li> Good value if they work for you.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said this was a good deal</li>
            <li> Good - they&#x27;re good for 4-5 shaves before they start to tug.</li>
            <li> with all things shaving, YMMV, so you probably don&#x27;t want to make the rookie move I did and purchase 100 of these guys unless you know they&#x27;re good for your face.  </li>
            <li> and I get a really good even shave</li>
            <li> I used it with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and loved the combination.</li>
            <li> they are good like they say.</li>
            <li> I bought the multi pack and this seemed to be the best fit for my face.  </li>
            <li> so I am good for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are good for shaving against the grain which i prefer for the closer shave.</li>
            <li> Good investment.</li>
            <li> The cost of the blades alone is a good reason to try them out to seeif you like them.</li>
            <li> For blades in quantity, I still lean toward the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> At this time it is great that there is another option than the cartridge style razors that are so popular with the kids.  </li>
            <li> I loved the price these Derby blades sold for, but upon arrival, I pulled one out and attempted to shave.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> and/or have not mastered making a good lather with a brush</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a good deal, an I recommend  it to get.  SW</li>
            <li> These razor blades are just as good as the ones you would purchase from any store.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product and</li>
            <li> good blade for the money.</li>
            <li> Good box size</li>
            <li> I get 4 shaves out of each blade, so durability is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i get about 4 shaves out of 1 blade, good product for the price.......</li>
            <li> i will def buy them again good deal.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are good blades.  </li>
            <li> I get a consistently good shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> blade good for newbies</li>
            <li> for the price still Damm good.</li>
            <li> came across a wise internet post about how the sharpest of razors is NOT what us with...</li>
            <li> It is a vastly superior shave to cartridges or an electric.  </li>
            <li> This is a good deal, what did I pay?</li>
            <li> Good quality and price</li>
            <li> It took a month to eventually use the Merkur and it was still good when I replaced it just to try these</li>
            <li> the price is still good</li>
            <li> That said, this is a lot of blades for a really good price.</li>
            <li> 7 or 8 good shaves from one blade...</li>
            <li> I wish I knew what the heck happened between 2009 and 2013, but it wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Fair price, and numbered</li>
            <li> When I tried them with my feather razor, they results were not as good.  </li>
            <li> The price point for the quality /quantity is dang good though.</li>
            <li> These Derby blades provide a good shave without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> These are excellent blades for me and my beard, and should be an excellent choice for anyone experienced or newto double edge shaving.   </li>
            <li> Save your money for something else, like good beer.</li>
            <li> Good price per amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several&lt;br /&gt;brands, &amp; find Derby to offer superior performance without having to hock</li>
            <li> blades are of excellent construction, giving smooth, close shaves, without&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I think they are a good value</li>
            <li> The Derby blades seem to be good for 3 to 4 shaves then I&#x27;m looking to replace them.</li>
            <li> These are a really good deal.</li>
            <li> but honestly they work great for me.  </li>
            <li> While not the best, they are cheap and a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Clean packaging, and well its perfect</li>
            <li> Best shave is just after hot shower, but I soap up and shave 5 days of the week and get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to:&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has a safety razor who is looking to stock up on some blades; this was truly an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> They work great for him and are the most affordable option we have come across.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these blades.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great razors and the cost is even better.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results using these blades along with a Merkur Futur set on 3. BBS with 3 passes and 4-5 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many blades</li>
            <li> There are better blades out there but for the price, these work great.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the price as well :)</li>
            <li> Okay but Astra&#x27;s win my vote.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li> great prices, along with top flight deliveries &amp; customer/consumer services.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m nice and the price was good, will be returning them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, good shave that is durable and tug free for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love these blades and the savings!</li>
            <li> and you sure won&#x27;t run out anytime soon!</li>
            <li> Now go pick your favorite razor and get started!</li>
            <li> Will not be buying more!</li>
            <li> I do not think you can get a better deal out there anywhere !</li>
            <li> I love de shaving!</li>
            <li> My husband and son love these blades !</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that these blades were not the best choice for me.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get 100 of them because double-edged blades aren&#x27;t that easy to find in stores anymore</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so affordable and yet give you a way more pleasant (and frankly, closer) shave than cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have gone through about 8 of these blades (two months worth of shaving) and they don&#x27;t give a very good shave and tend to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> razors are very good and definitely worth money.</li>
            <li> Shave is amazing  </li>
            <li> Probably work great for someone with a light beard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re literally amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing razors to go with my husband&#x27;s shaving kit.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> They are also an amazing value.</li>
            <li> gave it 5 stars great buy, alot of blades for a cheap price and they get the job done&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> and I have to say that that the handle is amazing, but the Derby blades are lacking.</li>
            <li> Great price for blades, they are smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing value.  </li>
            <li> Have received great, comfortable shaves with these blades.</li>
            <li> What a great smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> good blades--I love i</li>
            <li> Excellent blades and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> come in a nice hanging dispensing box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great blades!</li>
            <li> Thanks Derby you are awesome!</li>
            <li> These blades perform as intended and provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> I just began safety razor shaving and am loving it.</li>
            <li> Great blades, very reliable and at a great price</li>
            <li> I have tried all the blades from the pack, plus others I bought on my own.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely and leaves you with a manly smell.</li>
            <li> These blades give for a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that some companies still make a quality affordable product.  </li>
            <li> so i bought these for my husbands Ambroley Razor (which he loves) but found my own use for them as well-</li>
            <li> Go buy a nice bottle of scotch with the $ you save.</li>
            <li> the box contains mini-boxes of five razors, each razor wrapped in its own paper envelope and then again with wax paper held by some kind of tacky stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice blades that get the job done.</li>
            <li> to each his own.</li>
            <li> nice shaves.</li>
            <li> A nice shaving cream and brush help out too.  </li>
            <li> I own at this point</li>
            <li> It was actually nice not to shave</li>
            <li> I am telling you that the shave is nice and</li>
            <li> My safety razor came with Derby&#x27;s and I liked them.  </li>
            <li> You will get a nice shave with Derby and it won&#x27;t cut you all to hell.</li>
            <li> Then, when you are done, apply some nice Pinaud after shave and you are off in style..</li>
            <li> Its great clean feeling after shaving with Derby products.</li>
            <li> Though Astra, Crystal, Wilkinson, and US Personna are my top choices, the Derby is more than adequate, and considering price, tends toward the excellent category.</li>
            <li> A very good reasonably priced product, which allows me to change blades about once a week for $.50!</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, inexpensive but high in quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this blade and when the time comes to order more</li>
            <li> they are super flexible and were great to take a mark from painters</li>
            <li> If you have thicker growth, it may snag some and lose its edge quickly although I may have experienced that</li>
            <li> By far the best blade!</li>
            <li> good, cheap close shave ..</li>
            <li> Wow, these blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my greatest money saving product i purchased on amazon along with Merkur Model 180</li>
            <li> these blades are great for beginners, I rarely cut myself and when I did it was because I was pushing the razor instead of letting the weight of the razor do all the work.</li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s are BY FAR the best blades for MY face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start using my dad&#x27;s old razor but its not in the best of shape.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and these blades did an awesome job.</li>
            <li> nowadays - things that sound like a good idea</li>
            <li> Good close shave and dirt cheap</li>
            <li> 100 razors is kind of a lot, but they don&#x27;t expire, and I&#x27;ll need them for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased them and, for such a good price, they are excellent.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s old razor works best for shaving</li>
            <li> sure is nice never to pay the for those costly cartridges anymore.</li>
            <li> With this you get 100 Good quality razors that work fantastic for a beginner.</li>
            <li> If you want a good blade in the mid-range of aggressiveness and at a pretty good price, this is your blade.  </li>
            <li> All that said, I think these are pretty good blades and the packaging is good.</li>
            <li> Really nice, smooth, wonderful feeling shave and for super cheap.</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable and offers me an excellent /comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they honestly have a better edge than the Dorco blades and provide a better quality shave.</li>
            <li> Great price, does the job, but not as well as I would have imagined as a first timer.</li>
            <li> This is the first blade I have ever tried, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby blades for a year now, and they do a great job of shaving; you don&#x27;t feel like you are scraping and pulling hair at all; instead it is a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> Over all i was most satisfied with these blades for a good smooth shave, over all the most bang for the buck that i have tried.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was so impressed at how inexpensive these are and what a great value this is compared to the normal multi blades I have grown up with.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for beginners or those that don&#x27;t have much patience and like a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Good product, inexpensive and shipped quickly - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Very smooth and forgiving blade that gives a nice close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Ok, but not in the top three.</li>
            <li> Gives a much better shave than the disposable razors I have used for decades....</li>
            <li> When I remember from my youth many years ago is sliding them out of the container one by one into the razor.</li>
            <li> What I realized, was that sharper does not equate to a better shave.  </li>
            <li> But for the price, I can buy more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPOINTED, WITH ANYTHING THEN THIS</li>
            <li> buy Derby, love shaving</li>
            <li> but I hear that is what most people end up doing.  </li>
            <li> Recommend the Derby blades for every day, safe, shaving;</li>
            <li> what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> There are many choices out there for DE blades</li>
            <li> Could go more that 5 shaves per blade but at 12cents a week why push it.</li>
            <li> They are so much better than Derby.</li>
            <li> Feather is much better and the blade is sharpened to a more refined finish.</li>
            <li> And because of that, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the number of shaves on a blade, but will replace it more often, and thus eliminating the dreaded razor burn and/or</li>
            <li> Planing to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> A WAY BETTER ROUTE TO GO</li>
            <li> so go with the much better options out there...</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this blade because I had try so many others that were not working well.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and is such a great value!</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> They label these 1234 for each edge, top and bottom (one side 1 and 2/flip side 3 and 4), so you can wear it out evenly.</li>
            <li> For my money it doesn&#x27;t get better than Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I love the close cut it provides.</li>
            <li> I thought sharper was better in a bald</li>
            <li> Make sure to buy just one and NOT SUBSCRIBE, otherwise they&#x27;ll keep sending you one every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my &amp;#34;Merkur 180&amp;#34; razor and am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of those two factors, I like these blades and will be getting more.</li>
            <li> and I was always satisfied,</li>
            <li> These are good, packaged in convenient 5-blade dispensers, which will be useful when traveling.</li>
            <li> I think I like the Personna blades better, though.</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite blades for my DE.</li>
            <li> A smooth shave and the price won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I love the Derby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> 4 times I am sure but</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more need be said?</li>
            <li> , I think these are nearly the perfect blade, being very forgiving with a good quality lather.</li>
            <li> all the blades tried, this one landed at the top of the heap so we bought a box.</li>
            <li> People love Astra razors.</li>
            <li> After 3 shaves a butter knife would work better......................</li>
            <li> These are just ok.</li>
            <li> I can get three weeks and some time more per blade ,</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve saved many dollars over the throw away razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be Derby.</li>
            <li> Cuts nice and smooth in almost any DE razor.  </li>
            <li> I think I bought them 3 years ago, maybe more</li>
            <li> Make sure that you use a preshave routine with these razors.</li>
            <li> I got an ok shave with this</li>
            <li> but I also wanted a nice and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> There are almost as many types of blades as there are faces.  </li>
            <li> You would be best off starting with a sample pack, and go from there.  </li>
            <li> These work great with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Love the shave.  </li>
            <li> Love the # of</li>
            <li> Love the # of blades in the box.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with this blade back in April and was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better quality blades out there, but I won&#x27;t know for another .. 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, safety shaving works best with two passes in opposite directions.  </li>
            <li> BETTER THAN WALMART</li>
            <li> In addition, I get more shaves per blade with the Derby&#x27;s than I do with some others I use.</li>
            <li> so are many of clothes.  </li>
            <li> These blades are okay, they’re better than The Shark brand that came with my razor though.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.  </li>
            <li> Have only used one for 4 shaves and is excellent in both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought the 100 count because 100 Derby blades cost me a bit under $8...</li>
            <li> These are the better of the blades I ordered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for sure.</li>
            <li> My son who is starting to shave its perfect for him.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a wonderful leg shave!</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;second&#x27; best double edge blade.  </li>
            <li> I love my shaves</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite safety razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice smooth shave on the legs.</li>
            <li> ok-</li>
            <li> an area where Merkur blades seem to suit me better.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can order them 100 at a time is even better.</li>
            <li> i love these blades a lot and would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> But, if you get 3 to 5 shaves out of a blade, well then, that makes the bargain even better.  </li>
            <li> They do not irritate the skin one bit and gave me a way better shave than any disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent price and it works better than the Merkur blade for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> They are made in Sweden and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two or three shaves seems about the maximum rather than five or six (or more) with Astra, Merkur, Feather, etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor blade.</li>
            <li> So wonderfully cheap!</li>
            <li> Better than $35-$40 for 8 cartridges and</li>
            <li> the shave is much better to boot</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re wrapped safe and they shouldn&#x27;t rust out while they&#x27;re wrapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razor blades.  </li>
            <li> they get the job done, and i love the nifty plastic blade holders that you can also dispose of your used blades in.</li>
            <li> I rate these as somewhat better than Personnas.</li>
            <li> and I now have a supply for many years.</li>
            <li> Used this brand before, always gives a nice smooth cut.</li>
            <li> so others might get better life out of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will find any better value.</li>
            <li> But the Harry&#x27;s cartridges give me a better shave and don&#x27;t take a sample of my A+ blood, no matter how closely I shave.</li>
            <li> These have become one of my 2 favorite blades.</li>
            <li> Sure there are sharper blades out there</li>
            <li> It provides a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a steak knife would be a better option.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the more pricey blades may have a keener edge,&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li> I can get 4-6 &#x27;no-nick&#x27; shaves from this blade, why spend more for a blade</li>
            <li> I guess not terrible for the price though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recon I need to buy any more blades for a year.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> For the price you can not do better,</li>
            <li> 100 genuine Derby blades for around $20!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find better blades for the money.</li>
            <li> This experience has inspired me to buy a variety pack and see if I can find an even better alternative.</li>
            <li> They will shred your skin, leave tons of stubble and give you more bumps on your face than a herpes out break.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve since found another brand that works much much better for me (Feather blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good, inexpensive, double-edged razor blade Derby would be well worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I purchased these ones and Feather to compare which ones are better</li>
            <li> The shave is not quite as close, but more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li> However, this one is my brother&#x27;s favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I did fall for the hype &amp; shaved with cartridge razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> With my latest razors I&#x27;ve tried these and Astras and I&#x27;ve got to say</li>
            <li> , I feel like I get a better shave with these Derbys than I do with the Astras.  </li>
            <li> I do love Feather blades because they shave the closest</li>
            <li> I tried Derby and Feather, and for me, Derby gave me the better results.  </li>
            <li> I use an Edwin Jagger DE89, and absolutely love shaving now.</li>
            <li> but I think I like these blades even better.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am still trying to see how many shaves I can get from one blade.  </li>
            <li> got Astra that I will be trying, hopefully they are better than these.</li>
            <li> AND DERBYS ARE MORE FORGIVING.</li>
            <li> Do not use them for more than one shave.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  </li>
            <li> You get so many it saves $ and time from running to the store.</li>
            <li> Check out youtube videos if you need more tips on shaving with a safty razor.  </li>
            <li> We will purchase again for sure.  </li>
            <li> I always bought razors from Walgreens or Walmart, the house brand, and paid much more.</li>
            <li> I fear it will be even more aggressive than the WS</li>
            <li> with proper preparation, a pre shave oil and a perfect lather</li>
            <li> but more tugging and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These razors are my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they did</li>
            <li> I tried the Astra  blades and they were more aggressive and I bled more</li>
            <li> most cuts were under the nose and in the corner of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I ditched the Cartridge razors many years ago in favor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of pushing a razor over my face three or four times, although there are many out there who are.  </li>
            <li> These blades might be great for a beginner because they are very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how many blade 100 is until you get this package.</li>
            <li> - you get so much more for your money when you do.</li>
            <li> Hopefully their production issues will have gotten worked out before I need to order more blades</li>
            <li> If you do they give outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> I threw them away its better of just to go with the merkur razors.</li>
            <li> shaves more.</li>
            <li> There are many others out there</li>
            <li> There are many others out there</li>
            <li> If I experiment with another blade it will be only out of curiosity because the Derby blades seem about perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I think that razor does not position the blade as aggressively, so I had to take more passes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I got a variety pack awhile back and the Derby Extras gave me the best shave and lasted the longest.</li>
            <li> outstanding product i wish i would have bought years ago...would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t find better blades.</li>
            <li> The quality of these blades are OK and seem to be hit/</li>
            <li> So glad I picked these.</li>
            <li> These blades are OK but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> After prepping as explained, my shave this morning with a fresh Derby blade is as good as I expect out of any blade.  </li>
            <li> Medium rating in sharpness, but works well in a more aggressive DE razor.</li>
            <li> Seems to work best when shaving daily.</li>
            <li> These are barely ok.</li>
            <li> The feathers cost more.</li>
            <li> I bought a variety pack of blades when I switched to DE shaving, and found the Derby Extra to be best for my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for the price, turns out they are my favorite blade.</li>
            <li> There are better blades like Astra for the money.  </li>
            <li> Great blades and very affordable.</li>
            <li> My  favorite blades and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I seem to be able to shave faster with this blade</li>
            <li> but maybe I am just getting better at it.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra is without a doubt the best of all that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got a brick of 100 razors with this order.  </li>
            <li> This is a very economically way to by some nice blades.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the edge is good.</li>
            <li> Great sharp blades at a great price.</li>
            <li> i had great success with Astra and no irritation whatsoever, and they would just glide through and slice all the hairs cleanly and with ease.</li>
            <li> With the prices of 3, 4, and 5 blade replacement cartridges going higher all the time it is wonderful to find this inexpensive yet very efficient alternative.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not made in Russia, Greece, or Germany which are the most consistent quality wise by reputation.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that happy Derby users have a very fine and soft beards.</li>
            <li> These are high quality razors at a great price.</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount of blades included, this was a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> Tried for the first time, good quality.</li>
            <li> I use a good amount of lather and consistent shave angle.</li>
            <li> First use Olive oil after taking shower, massage it good, then take quality foam or Shaving cream and brush.  </li>
            <li> Use a hot soap cup and badger brush for optimum shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s a pretty good idea to change blades</li>
            <li> Good first blade for noobies to practice their technique before moving on to a sharper blade.</li>
            <li> Great for those that are new to safety razors, like me.</li>
            <li> Great blades, I haven&#x27;t had to buy new ones for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Very glad I did, they seem to be the right blades for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this many blades, but I find they don&#x27;t hold an edge nearly as well as Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly into my Edwin Jagger double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> There was a time when I thought all blades should last forever, then found good shaving takes good blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap and coming from a guy who has to shave every third day, they work awesome.</li>
            <li> Less than $8 is an incredible price for 100 blades, so I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazingly inexpensive and very effective especially for the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work fine.  </li>
            <li> These razors worked just fine, and they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li> They get your face so clean cut!</li>
            <li> Even avid shavers should have a pretty good run with this!</li>
            <li> Before Derby, I had purchased blades from Wallmart and tht were like 5 blades for $3 and this was like $10 for 100 which is great deal and works good, sharp and satusfied.</li>
            <li> Still, that&#x27;s a nice smooth clean</li>
            <li> Sexy smooth legs</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m extremely happy with their performance.</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s are the most comfortable and closest shaves</li>
            <li> it has given me the closest, most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Of all the blades I use, this one provides the smoothest and most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also not as smooth as the platinum coated ones I tried, but slightly better than the cheapo brand.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder why more men don&#x27;t use safety razors, given how cheaply one can get his hands on blades like this.  </li>
            <li> All I can tell you is that they work much better than drugstore razors and they are ridiculously cheap.  </li>
            <li> But then I got to try some Derby blades that came free with a shaving brush I bought, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth his skin is with these razors.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for $10 is a great value, but if 20 of those blades mangle your face, you&#x27;re better off spending a couple extra bucks on a better brand.</li>
            <li> but, they are the most forgiving and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very forgiving on those who&#x27;ve not yet mastered the art of building a good lather for slip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Really good blades for the price and very forgiving</li>
            <li> It really feels good to walk by box store displays of three or four blades for twelve or thirteen bucks of &#x27;safety razor&#x27; blades.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat a good shave with a real blade</li>
            <li> it is strongly recommended that you pick up a blade sampler pack (there are many available here on Amazon)</li>
            <li> Great for those who have sensitive skin and get irritated easy.</li>
            <li> Also excellent, a little sharper but very smooth.  </li>
            <li> With good shaving soap like Taylor of Old Bond St..and hydrating your skin properly Derby is a good product and good value...Jlewis0904@comcast.net Philly, Pa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the blades and smoothness of the shave, as compared to other brands Shark and Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sharp blade and it delivers an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome razors, there sharp and have no defects</li>
            <li> They stayed sharp with the best in the bunch, but weren&#x27;t overly aggressive in my razor.</li>
            <li> I will however continue to try all the brands I can get ahold of; after all, they are all better then the original fancy razors.</li>
            <li> Needs more environmentally friendly packaging for bulk quantity.</li>
            <li> If you do plan on using a new blade for each shave, I would again recommend these Derby blades because lets be honest, under $10 for 100 blades is about the best deal you can get, especially since each blade has two edges.</li>
            <li> no matter what so its easy to keep track.</li>
            <li> I think this could easily be a 9 to 12 month supply of blades.  </li>
            <li> Yes you have to have a razor that accepts these blades, but you can easily buy one of these razors for about 30 bucks--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a touch to easy to slide the razor sideways while running it along your head, and the 3 times I tried it</li>
            <li> Packaging makes dispensing blades easy.</li>
            <li> , these blades work and will not rip your face off, seems like an easy choice.</li>
            <li> Easy blades to begin shaving with.</li>
            <li> so I can easily take one when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li> shaves easily, I could probably push them but why bother.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very mild on my face</li>
            <li> My wonderful wife got them for me and when I opened them, I really felt old school holding that retro looking package of 100 double-edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are what I would call a very mild razor blade.  </li>
            <li> easy.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works as described and easy to install into the razor.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> Clean up passes didn’t result in a much better shave.</li>
            <li> I got a kit of a few blades to test and these are the best for most people.</li>
            <li> I can easily get  five shaves out of one blade, and if I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cost of replacing the blade too soon.  </li>
            <li> Good for four shaves and a decent shave on the fifth.</li>
            <li> Well price wise, its a good deal, however, the blade itself almost ruined wet shaving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked very much the product, it is easy and efficient for use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking a good blades.</li>
            <li> It took several attempts to find the right razor that worked best on my face.  </li>
            <li> This generally are great blades.</li>
            <li> Besides, how cool is it to be able to say you shave &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I have found the perfect balance between sharp and smooth with these gems.</li>
            <li> But it is simply excellent - sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Like most people I turned to a DE (safety) shaver in full scale revolt against overpriced drugstore razors from Gillette, Schick, etc.  </li>
            <li> A shave as good as any brand new, 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> and they work fine, so</li>
            <li> The blades seem to be fine.  </li>
            <li> Another fine product from Turkey.</li>
            <li> Derby razors are not the sharpest, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> That is fine, we are all unique.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they work fine in the milder ones also.</li>
            <li> They shave just fine, no issues at all using them with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Fine razors.</li>
            <li> I used it in a ReMei razor and it did a good job removing a day’s worth of stubble on the first pass.</li>
            <li> and they work just fine in my Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
            <li> These are his favorite blades and buying in bulk makes them super affordable.</li>
            <li> These probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best thing if you had really super thick hair or were planing to shave your head with them or something, but for medium hair/ womens leg hair (yes, ladies, these are better than Venus razors!)</li>
            <li> So much cheaper and better!</li>
            <li> I got these when I was new to wet-shaving because they were cheap, they were the blades that came with my razor, and they had good reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Heck, use a brush and cream/soap if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing, but if quick and cheap is more your style, foam is fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their materials and quality seem top notch as the razors are long lasting and give a great shave while their sharpness is also great too.</li>
            <li> Very impressed for how little they cost.</li>
            <li> They were a little too aggressive for me, but for others they may be a perfect blade.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to a premium blade, and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If you use each blade 3 times you can go almost all year on just this pack, or you can go buy a store razor or disposable razors and just pay these huge corporations who overcharge on their product to begin with and just throw your money in the trash...</li>
            <li> and I decided to purchase the Derby blades because the quantity that you get for such a cheap price is just great.  </li>
            <li> Stop spending the big bucks on cartage razor and use these if you want a close comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li> These razors work fantastic on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a smooth shave without the cuts and scrapes that I get from Dorco ST301s and Shark blades.</li>
            <li> A bunch in a cheap package.</li>
            <li> will continue to use these not only for quality but for the great price</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the pragmatic and ritualistic aspects of wet-shaving.  </li>
            <li> Used shark blades before with better success.</li>
            <li> Too be honest, they remind me of Merkur blades (which also work very well on my beard).</li>
            <li> Cheapest blade available: 100 blades for $7.50.</li>
            <li> Great blades that last me about 3 weeks each.  </li>
            <li> These are very consistently smooth blades and packaged well.</li>
            <li> did not provide a smooth result, pulls on whiskers, leaves face feeling irritated.</li>
            <li> I prefer these blades, they are light and the coating helps them slide smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li> I want to try the sharpest blades available</li>
            <li> Great value for a 100 pack and will probably last me 1-2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Quality has diminished since construction left great Britain.</li>
            <li> He is on second box with no complaints and great shaves.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pay a buck a day to brush my teeth or comb my hair, so a great shave should be no different.</li>
            <li> Now, the important part: Is it for me?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a total win in my book.</li>
            <li> Price is fantastic...</li>
            <li> I do it because I enjoy doing it.  </li>
            <li> I always want to enjoy doing whatever I do in life and wasn&#x27;t going to make an exception with shaving.  </li>
            <li> Yet, provides smooth cut without dragging .</li>
            <li> fit the razor I bought.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this razor and it works great in my double edge safety razor from Edwin jagger.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic blades.</li>
            <li> This blade will cut smoothly on a beard of medium thickness or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the same blade for five great shaves.</li>
            <li> , that is still cheap.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hack away at your face and my goodness are they cheap.</li>
            <li> Keeping your blade cost below $0.10 per blade is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a safety razor is much better if you are using a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> A great price on these and each blade tends to last 3-5 days for me.  </li>
            <li> Now using this blade/razor combo I am baby smooth nearly all day, which is something I rarely ever experienced before.  </li>
            <li> actually enjoy shaving now</li>
            <li> I can get a comfortable shave that is close and nick free.</li>
            <li> A close comfortable shave with 2 passes and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he says it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This blade I&#x27;ve learned is all I personally need to get a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Have semi coarse beard and these give me a great shave.</li>
            <li> but that is cheap compared to what you spend on Mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They give these blades away in razors because they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great blades, they last a 3-5 shaves for me.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the job well as I can feel my smooth face after</li>
            <li> Blades are rust free and fit my grooming comb.  </li>
            <li> I use each blade for about a week &amp; could probably use them longer, but they are so cheap at about 10 cents</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and I find myself feeling it throughout the day...</li>
            <li> Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> definetly worth the price but better blades out there.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> These leave your face feeling smooth with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I got a free 5 pack sampler and decided to try them.</li>
            <li> These are terrific blades, and represent a great value for your dollar.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is replace the blades often to prevent any skin irritation and to develop smooth skin.</li>
            <li> and after one pass the skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever had the joy to shave with a double edge you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> For me switching to shaving with a double edge safety razor and all it involves has made shaving a joy for me</li>
            <li> Enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Not as smooth as Astra.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave with no razor burn and isn&#x27;t overly aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> These blades were &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; by me, and so far, are a good purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also tried a very diverse multi-brand sample pack and found that Derby and Blue Bird were the best blades for me.</li>
            <li> Make sure you prep your face prior to shaving and use a good post shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The quality seems good so far</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> To find out what works best with YOUR face/shaving technique/products, YOU really need to try some different blades.  </li>
            <li> I get two good shaves from each razor with no cuts or scrapes so far.</li>
            <li> Box looks sweet on the shelf with all the cool Arabic writing on it too!</li>
            <li> I find it great that it&#x27;s not too sharp as it allows you to perform a 3 pass shave no problem with some good lather to get a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Having converted to safety razor shaving I decided to give these blades a try after reading several reviews, and happy to say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I shave pretty aggressively (I use more pressure than I probably should) and still enjoy a fine shave with no bumps, irritation, or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> What you see its exactly what you get!!</li>
            <li> VERY ECONOMICAL.</li>
            <li> Very economical.</li>
            <li> This is a very economical blade so that would be a plus.</li>
            <li> Originally tried these when they came free with a DE razor I purchased.  </li>
            <li> and I highly suggest get a sampler of different DE razors to see which works best for beginners first.ch, these are probably some of the dullest blades you can get but forgiving for beginners like me.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give wet shaving a try, and based on so many excellent reviews, picked up a box of 100 of these blades along with my new razor.</li>
            <li> Just smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades have a good reputation, a huge following, and are probably the most economical option available concerning blades.</li>
            <li> They shave nice and clean and smooth when they are new.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, as always, Keep Calm and Shave On!</li>
            <li> these have become my favorite and go to first blades</li>
            <li> started out with a sampler pack, and was glad I was able to try many different blades.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> 100ct for like $8 is over 2 years worth of shaving for me!</li>
            <li> I really need more history with these, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> how many sha0ves I will get from a blade but am sure more than what I got fro those blue plastic two blade razors.</li>
            <li> I also need to ensure that the angle of razor to face is more consistent.</li>
            <li> Since I first picked up the double-edge razor I&#x27;ve reduced appearances of razor bumps while being able to shave like my Angelo-Saxon friends.</li>
            <li> so worth a try if you haven&#x27;t tried them!</li>
            <li> I realize that these Derby blades are a bit more forgiving for first time users.</li>
            <li> The way this morning&#x27;s shave felt, I may get one or two more shaves with this first blade.</li>
            <li> The best part is that these are so cheap you can shave forever and hardly spend anything.</li>
            <li> A nice new blade for every shave will leave you feeling like a million bucks after every shower.</li>
            <li> although the blades have varied in edge sharpness, i have luckily been able to find more of my shaves comfortable--some new blades have varied in their edge.</li>
            <li> but they are better than I expected and really good for the price.</li>
            <li> Super cheap blades.</li>
            <li> They are on the gentle side of the spectrum so if you have sensitive skin they are great.  </li>
            <li> Product is good, cheap compared to big name twin, three or four blades razors.  </li>
            <li> I have a thinner beard growth but require a clean shave for work, these work well for me.</li>
            <li> After about 5 uses I grab a clean razor</li>
            <li> They are super cheap and shave well.  </li>
            <li> For around $7.50, I get 200 clean shaves.</li>
            <li> The only people giving these good reviews are people that were introduced to them as free razors.  </li>
            <li> Does NOT give a clean shave.</li>
            <li> No matter how clean your strike you are NOT getting through in one swing</li>
            <li> I tried nearly a dozen different brands of blades before settling on Derby as the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, and the Derby Extra DE blades have worked out the best for me.  </li>
            <li> Because I can get so many for so cheap, it&#x27;s not a tough call for me to get one shave out of the each blade and just toss it.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave without paying the super high prices for the triple or quad blade razors/moneypits.  </li>
            <li> $10 for 100&#x3D; 10 cent a blade, lasts me 5 shaves, but I could throw away after every single shave and it would stll be a great value.</li>
            <li> The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves the skin VERY smooth after a 2 pass.</li>
            <li> The Derbys are very smooth and very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> Great smooth shave, not too sharp as to cut face up.</li>
            <li> These blades have a good edge that they keep for more cycles than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for the beginner and can be carried on to a &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; for most other shavers.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a nice shave cream (Proraso or Col Conk), use a badger or boar hair brush to apply it, recommend a Merkur double edge and put a Derby razor in there, and you will get an awesome shave for much less money.</li>
            <li> Find the right blade for your skin!</li>
            <li> Solid, well made, and all-around fine safety razors at a great price buying in a 100 count pack.</li>
            <li> These razor blades seem dull at best.</li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s be honest, i am most excited about the mirror and how i can use these flexible things to clean other smooth surfaces if needed.</li>
            <li> If you are really concerned about the &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; of your razor blade, it is more important to use a fresh blade each time you shave, not to buy the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blade out there.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival and use, they are excellent and have worked well for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> their throats..great for experienced wet shavers as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the blades and they&#x27;ve all been great on the first shave...</li>
            <li> Each side is good for two to three shaves, and since I&#x27;m in that habit of shaving about five times per week, I only need to change the blade about once per week.</li>
            <li> With the economy the way it is, having a smooth face for such a low price is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li> you use the double edge system, these are a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same blade for over a week and was still getting good shaves from it.  </li>
            <li> but I love these so much and don&#x27;t have any need to switch.</li>
            <li> This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li> I get a closer shave with the Derby Razors, Also these blades are very affordable, I intend to order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a much closer shave with these blades than the ones that came with the Micro Touch One.</li>
            <li> Many people rave about the Feather blades, but I cannot comment because I have not tried them, however, for about 10 cents a blade you&#x27;ll get a very forgiving blade with the Derby.  </li>
            <li> something that I could not do with most razors, including the one that came with my Merkur safety razor thus resulting in a much shinier dome.  </li>
            <li> It slices straight thru and leaves him smooth faced!</li>
            <li> But each blade is only good for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper and each blade lasts just as many shaves as a cartridge razor</li>
            <li> The value is good but just plan to take some extra time.</li>
            <li> Having to use so many means they really aren&#x27;t inexpensive.</li>
            <li> you want these blades, only buy 10-20 to learn and then move onto the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a full beard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true,</li>
            <li> One blade is good enough for me!!!</li>
            <li> My last shave with the blade is still a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of blades and the Derby are my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> not bad..</li>
            <li> Also not bad with my Merkur Vision.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are not as Wallmart one but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Again, for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for light shaves and for $10 for a 100ct you can use a new one every shave and never have to listen to your wallet cringe.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent starter blade for new wet shavers</li>
            <li> That super smooth against the grain shave isn&#x27;t worth my face burning the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that this single blade does a better job than the 10 blade Gillette turbo ultra vibrating swivel jet.</li>
            <li> Really great blades, not too aggressive, but more than enough to give you a close, relatively nick free shave.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades, look forward to shaving now with my new shaver !  </li>
            <li> They are super affordable to use.</li>
            <li> Derby blades aren&#x27;t defective, they are decent and better than Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li> What blades are best truly relies on the individual&#x27;s skin and facial hair qualities.</li>
            <li> Maybe im shaving too quickly</li>
            <li> I compared these blades to my Merkur Super blades and both blades are identical in size.</li>
            <li> If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> The second and third shaves are the best with this blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get what you pay for, if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li> , when I first got my first safety razor, I did what most do.</li>
            <li> Really wasn&#x27;t impressed with them, and found that just after a few days that blades seems to have pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Soap up, shave one way, use the remaining lather on the brush and do another quick pass.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional bargain for those of us who use a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Maybe 3 or 4 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for beginner wetshavers because they&#x27;re very forgiving, however, your face/facial hair may be different from mine and this blade may not suit you</li>
            <li> The Voshkod and Gillette Silver Blue provided better shaving results and more shaves per blade for me.  </li>
            <li> I have to change blades after a couple of shaves, but the price for 100 blades is a super bargain.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive but these blades work great and are cheap enough to switch out the blades often.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There are many shaving snobs out there that act as if shaving is high art.  </li>
            <li> I get 4 really good shaves out of a blade, and could squeeze 1 or 2 more but that requires a little more force and thus increased irritation, so after 4 shaves I go to a new blade.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades gives a really close shave and also have very good prices.</li>
            <li> Not too razor sharp, so great for beginners, and price of about 10 cents/blade is economical for one-shave average/blade.</li>
            <li> But I am happy I did go back, Blades are good for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades are nice and sharp, giving me a much better shave than the starter blades I received.</li>
            <li> I could not get these blades to give a smooth, reasonably close shave without getting chewed up and/or needing a 4th pass!</li>
            <li> Great starting point for beginners, but one should determine later, with more experience shaving, if 100 is needed.</li>
            <li> they are much sharper, and also extremely smooth, but cut the skin much more readily.</li>
            <li> These look good and function well in my merkur long handle.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need a brush or fancy cream - good old canned shave cream foam (Barbasol or similar) works fine with DE blades.  </li>
            <li> When you get a good one, these blades are a good as any I&#x27;ve tried, but a fair number have been off the mark - dull, uneven, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these cost effective blades and recommend them for any new DE wet shaver.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and perform VERY well for about 4-5 shaves so why not change them slightly more frequently than necessary and great shave everytime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the Derby&#x27;s work best for me when I shave no less than every other day.  </li>
            <li> Great price, but the blades weren&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li> Great Swedish blades for the money, very sharp, depending on your beard can use each blade up to a week.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great price.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks&#x27; practice and one or two good YouTube vids, but stainless steel dual edge blades shave as well or better than Mach3 or other cartridge</li>
            <li> (albeit the feather is wicked smooth since it is equally wicked sharp requiring excellent lathering technique).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, but the razors that came with my razor did a better job.</li>
            <li> Tried the Wilkinson classic made in Germany, much sharper and much more comfortable shave than the Derby.</li>
            <li> so their sharpness is pretty good and combine that with the overall price</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been satisfied with most \\&quot;hi-tech\\&quot; nonsense razors systems in America for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will also note that my hair is fine, and even so I could still tell a large difference.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a single good shave with derby razors.</li>
            <li> Good, sharp, clean blades.</li>
            <li> a can&#x27;t tell much difference !!</li>
            <li> The first shave, is smoother than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life!</li>
            <li> Safety razors are way better and 1000x cheaper to utilize than those Fusion or Mach products on store shelves, do not waste your money... get a safety razor and some derby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> If you have have sensitive skin and not a thick beard the Derby will probably fit you nicely.</li>
            <li> I need to work on my skin tightening and facial muscles to make the razor glide more easily.</li>
            <li> and if for some odd reason they aren&#x27;t right for you they will make a great PIF.</li>
            <li> Great shave these little babies provide.</li>
            <li> Close shave, little to no irritation, and a great value when buying 100 pack.</li>
            <li> last for several shaves and also they are a very good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many good Derby blades, however, every blade in this pack of one hundred has been extremely dull.  </li>
            <li> A huge bundle of these can more than easily last you a year!</li>
            <li> The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li> but nothing that stood out as something I would really want to keep or buy in bulk as my primary blade.</li>
            <li> I really like the smooth, close shave I get with these blades.  </li>
            <li> so my husband says they are great for the razor, and we both agree that they save a lot of waste (think: no disposable cartridges with all the plastic packaging that comes along with the)...</li>
            <li> When shaving my face, I get a very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving with these straight razor&#x27;s gives a smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have really grown to appreciate what a smooth shave I get with these Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving yet very forgiving.</li>
            <li> smooth cut (sometimes cuts too much maybe)...</li>
            <li> They are smooth and don&#x27;t cause irritation, they just don&#x27;t give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Very forgiving blade, but does not provide me with a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> so you can safely dispose of your old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use one blade a week, then throw it out and replace it with a fresh one.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> the Derby&#x27;s are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> No irritation and rarely do I cut myself with these.</li>
            <li> Still worth the price we paid for all of them together.</li>
            <li> Provides a far superior shave to any cartridge style razor I have ever used and is considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have the ability to grow a full beard so with each shave I am plowing through a lot of stubble and even with that fact in mind these Derby blades have not failed to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> A week&#x27;s worth of shaving for under 10 cents?  </li>
            <li> and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I own one and it doesn&#x27;t extend the blade&#x27;s life appreciably - certainly not enough to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> Price is nice, but I may purchase a different brand when these are depleted.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is the norm and even so it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li> That is over years&#x27; worth of blades in one shot.</li>
            <li> Not for me, even a fresh blade felt like it was pulling out hairs and not cutting them.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice is that each blade come individually wrapped in bandaid style wrapping paper.  </li>
            <li> They come in individual packages of five, which is nice when traveling.</li>
            <li> If you have a razor like the old time ones you will love these</li>
            <li> well worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Just bought a hundred (that&#x27;s about two years worth for me).</li>
            <li> Worth buying in the 100 box.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for several weeks now and they work nicely.</li>
            <li> Prior to that I had used Shark blades (which I liked) and Feather blades (</li>
            <li> But it is well worth the time.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Derby is a nice blade for a low price.</li>
            <li> I have got almost two weeks worth of shaving out of one blade.</li>
            <li> but well worth the time, effort and money.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for $10 sure beats the $20+ for a pack of 4 for the old Gillette.</li>
            <li> These are clearly the most forgiving/non aggressive blades in the market place.  </li>
            <li> Whoa...the Derbys are by far better.  </li>
            <li> Darn good middle of the road blade really.  </li>
            <li> It would be really useful to me if there was a 25 count of these blades.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and lasts for about a week before dullness and stains set in.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the $.</li>
            <li> Bought these with a new Weishi premium long handle razor, they work great.</li>
            <li> that adds up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The blades are good however not as sharp as I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I need good sharp blades that are not going to irritate.</li>
            <li> and the price is really a good buy, if you compare it to other</li>
            <li> Sharp and cut good.</li>
            <li> Good and sharp.</li>
            <li> ASTRAS WERE A LITTLE MORE FORGIVING ,VERY SHARP AND EXCELLENT VALUE.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews that these were a good value, I decided to go for it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a couple of snobs in here talking these blades down only because of its price, lol.</li>
            <li> I find these blades to be just right with longevity and shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> and it still plows right through it after a weeks growth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest going to Shaving 101 to read their article on \\&quot;Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I figured I just didn&#x27;t have the touch to do it right.</li>
            <li> Finding razor blade is like Goldilocks and The 3 Bears--what might be right for you, may not be right for some.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> give it 5 stars for all the right reasons.</li>
            <li> These blades do not disappoint and the price is right for 100.  </li>
            <li> These  razors are just right.  </li>
            <li> I find them the right balance of smoothness and effectiveness -- and at the right price.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> You need to find the right blade for your razor and hair type.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re just right.</li>
            <li> I will try other blades over time, but these blades are more than satisfactory to give me a smooth clean shave that exceeds cartridges closeness.</li>
            <li> The Derby gives a great shave without the raw feeling of the Feather.  </li>
            <li> The blades themselves are the exact quality I expected them to be, and I was absolutely delighted with the speed of the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li> It either cuts my face too much, or doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs cleanly or well at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated, and these derby blades make shaving a nightmare of tissue and stiptic pens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no other blades to compare to, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying clean and inexpensive shaves for years off that first box, and FINALLY have had to replace the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and I can safely say they work very well for the beginner.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, I bought this a while back and still haven&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using double edge razors for many years and own several.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Razor blades tend to be a controversial topic for some.</li>
            <li> These work best for me on their second shave - I should probably try corking, but so far it&#x27;s working well enough.</li>
            <li> These blades were not as good as Feather, Wilkinson and other brands!</li>
            <li> Nice shave, usualy last 4 shaves - nice and sharp but not overly aggressive.</li>
            <li> Of course, everyone&#x27;s face and beard is different, so your results may vary, but these are sure worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve much better success and would suggest that anyone starting to wet-shave try a sample pack of blades, rather than these.  </li>
            <li> Of course, you&#x27;ll need to try various blades if you have a different razor than me, but this is a great combination in my experience.</li>
            <li> I only get one or two comfortable shaves out of each blade, but they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
            <li> I got into double edge shaving mostly for economical reasons</li>
            <li> 10% of the blades are good for less than 5 days.</li>
            <li> I currently use Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, but any good shave cream will work well.  </li>
            <li> If the zombie apocalypse happens in the near future, I&#x27;ll have a nice clean shave for quite some time.</li>
            <li> When using a DE razor I will highly suggest everyone to clean there blades with sterile alcohol</li>
            <li> Sure, some expert shaving researchers out there have used their fancy electron microscopes to determine that some other brands have blades that are a few microns thinner, and therefore sharper, but let&#x27;s be honest, for more than twice the price is it worth it?</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, the choice of double edged razors is pretty personal - all I can say is that these work just great for me.</li>
            <li> The cost of these razors are so cheap in comparison to cartridges for the old razors we would purchase at the store!</li>
            <li> Granted, using the old fashion double edged razor is not every ones cup of tea, but if your willing to put a wee effort into your morning shave, these blades are certainly a good value.  </li>
            <li> I like these blades very much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Picking a DE blade is a personal choice -- these work for me and happen to be a great value, but any DE blade is a better deal than those horrible 5-blade plastic monstrosities people &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; with, so buy a bunch and pick what you like best -- just include Derby in your pool when you do.</li>
            <li> Derby extra is very cheap and but this affects a bit of quality.</li>
            <li> They lose their edge very very fast.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how this particular set is packaged in convenient little boxes of five, great for travel.</li>
            <li> Shave so nice and smooth with these blades and were highly reccomended by other users.</li>
            <li> Preparation is the most important, just like every other task.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, thanks!</li>
            <li> Had my first DE shave today using these blades in a Jagger 89 razor.  </li>
            <li> They do exactly what you&#x27;d expect razor blades to do.</li>
            <li> Slightly more cuts, but the irritation was actually quite a bit lower.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely notice a bit more tug and pull with these blades.</li>
            <li> I first started using them with a safety razor 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> chose this rating as i used the first blade..</li>
            <li> Excellent price, but not excellent</li>
            <li> Is exactly what they are.</li>
            <li> Mostly with Wilkinson blades though I have used Mekur, Astra, Feather (lost a bit of my lip to the only one I ever used)</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s are the first blade I have used with no learning curve.</li>
            <li> they work great for me, but then again I don&#x27;t have a thick bushy beard.</li>
            <li> fast!  </li>
            <li> My buddy uses Derby for his straight edge too!  </li>
            <li> It was my first time buying them.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO SHAVE 5X A WEEK FOR WORK AND AM A PRETTY HAIRY GUY.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> and it creates razor bumps and irritation unlike my current favorite, astra.</li>
            <li> Better than the standard blade that came with my Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li> Currently you can&#x27;t find a better blade than these at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feathers are sharper at first, but become unusable after a couple of shaves.  </li>
            <li> and I think it will last me a couple more months.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my first DE attempt.</li>
            <li> Double edge blades are the most subjective thing in the world.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So 100 blades should last me a while :)</li>
            <li> (Better than Feather for daily shaving, IMHO.)</li>
            <li> I can get two weeks&#x27; use out of each blade by flipping it over after the first week.</li>
            <li> , The Derby Extra has always been the top  performer for me-</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back to my favorite blade!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time didn&#x27;t go so well</li>
            <li> (I can let it get pretty scruffy because I work from home)</li>
            <li> you insist on trying them, please try a sample pack first, because you don&#x27;t want to get stuck with 100 POS blades like I did.</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler package from the many independent sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> can say my second favorite are Shark razors.</li>
            <li> Great price when buying bulk -- I should have these for at least two years.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for a first time DE shaver, and here is why:  </li>
            <li> they give a nice close shave with minimal cuts and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how so many people can write such glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> Even the Wilkinson or generic blades from Wal-Mart or Kroger are waaaay better than these things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m preferring these over the Lord, Wilkinson, and Feather, in my Lord L6 handle, though all are pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact I am able to use blade for multiple days before I need to change it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and yes, I do know how to shave properly. :)</li>
            <li> At 100 count - this should last for many years.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased a 50 pack, so I&#x27;ll be shaving with Derby for the better part of the next year.</li>
            <li> I figured if I couldn&#x27;t use them I&#x27;d hand them off to friends (which is exactly what I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person.</li>
            <li> Consistent shave and affordable.</li>
            <li> I look like just survived an assassination attempt when I try to shave with the same blade more than once.</li>
            <li> how much is 5 years of mach 3 blades worth?</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 4 or 5 days with the same razor, I start to notice that I need more passes to get a close shave so plan to swap them out every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> :) Will definitely purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat $.08 cents a razor, and this gives really close shaves!  </li>
            <li> I actually find that I&#x27;m able to go against the grain on my scalp;</li>
            <li> So not only is this a heck of a lot cheaper than cartridge shaving, but I get a lot closer, and better shave without all the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Derby blade in most of my double edge razors.</li>
            <li> These are the first blades I have bought for my DE Razor.  </li>
            <li> pretty uniformly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than those triple and quad-bladed razors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extras for several weeks now and am pleased with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> I initially tried the Sharkies and I like these better.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of blades I have bought for my DE razors.</li>
            <li> You get the sharpest blades and your face looks like you fell face first off a motorcycle.</li>
            <li> The blades are then safely contained, and if I lose it, I&#x27;m only out five of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> See you in 2014 ;)</li>
            <li> I should have tried sample pack first.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t even feel it most of the time initially.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still on the first one).  </li>
            <li> I still have many years of shaving left in this body, I hope.</li>
            <li> There are better blade such as a feather.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor</li>
            <li> definitely go back to this seller for more</li>
            <li> These were exactly  what I needed and quite inexpensive per blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll some more of these next year when I run out.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not cutting myself as much and</li>
            <li> These however are even better priced and a pack of a 100 should last you a couple years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a first timer and cut my fingers accidentally.</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving with a DE razor</li>
            <li> First, they&#x27;re made in Turkey, not Sweden.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  </li>
            <li> the future I am unsure if I would purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to it as much as my first cup of coffee in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so this razor may be better for you than it was for me.  </li>
            <li> Seem to last for more shaves too.</li>
            <li> Most people on the shaving forums feel the same.</li>
            <li> First time using them, I did nick myself once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a variety of DE razor blades when I first started using DE razors.  </li>
            <li> I used this first blade for the 5th time this morning and it still outperforms the others I tried.</li>
            <li> And the price simply cannot be beat for so many.</li>
            <li> I do use the same blade more than once (three times</li>
            <li> (most recently Wilson Swords (?)).  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few others, but I get a good close shave with Derby.</li>
            <li> find that Derby&#x27;s are a good price, get me anywhere from 2-4 shaves per blade and after a few hundred of them I can say they are manufactured</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and did research online to find a good blade recommendation for a beginner.</li>
            <li> They are so cheap at about 10c a blade, you could use a new blade every day if you really wanted.</li>
            <li> These blades are nice, especially for someone new to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> previously used a pack of the Shark brand, which were good, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference with these, with the exception that they cost much</li>
            <li> I realize everyone&#x27;s needs differ, but I consistently get 5 clean, comfortable shaves per blade before changing it, and only do so because how much could do you expect for $0.09 per blade.</li>
            <li> I know that every face is different, and different blades suit peoples faces better than others, but this is a blade that i read good things about, but has only caused my face irritation.</li>
            <li> As an African American guy I am very prone to ingrown hairs, but these blades cut at just the right length to make my face look good and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as sharp as some brands who focus on being extra sharp, the Derbys are the perfect balance of sharpness in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Some experienced wet shavers advocate getting a sample pack of different brands of de blades to see which ones agrees to your razor, beard, and skin type.  </li>
            <li> with any double edge system, a good shaving cream and brush and necessary!</li>
            <li> I shave everyday for work and love the feel of my smooth face afterwards.</li>
            <li> they are good what you pay, Much better than expensive disposable  razors.</li>
            <li> I do multiple passes in different directions which you must do to get a good shave, these blades allow you to do this without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The price of the blades (even starting up for that matter) is a lot cheaper than buying the more modern shavers.</li>
            <li> Some blades are sharp, some are smooth, this is a fine combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Delivery was mixed with other items, came fairly quickly; packaging is good.</li>
            <li> .. I had my doubts at first because i usually use shark razors but after trying them, i&#x27;ll never go back, quick delivery and great product..</li>
            <li> Fortunately they seem to work really well for my lower neck which had real problems with my old disposable and also with some merkur blades  </li>
            <li> These are a great shave, they do not nick like some other safety blades I&#x27;ve used recently.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, Cheap, Fantastic, and get it.</li>
            <li> I use to think the red Personna and the lab blue Personna DE razor blades were the best for my sensitive skin, but these Derby Extra DE blades are far superior, and make the Personna&#x27;s feel rough.</li>
            <li> A hot shower really does help hydrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used about ten of these so far, and they are certainly superior among the blades I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for an average blade for my adjustable and these fill the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> Then when the jar is full, dispose of jar and old blades all at once.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough for a great shave but not sharp enough that you&#x27;ll need a PhD in shaving to get an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> They provide a great shave and last much longer than I expected!</li>
            <li> The blades are just sharp enough (no razor burn yet) to give me a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this 100 count pack thinking the bargain was worth the risk on a new blade.</li>
            <li> Have been using these blades since December, great shave, I have a very thick coarse beard, and these cut clean !</li>
            <li> It is amazing what you can use a microwave for: a normal washcloth wet, then squeezed out, rolled up and heated for 50 seconds works for me.</li>
            <li> It is easily 1/5 the cost of regular shaving blades.  </li>
            <li> but since I have pretty light facial hair I figured they would work alright.</li>
            <li> At this price it&#x27;s easy to refill often, but I grow a moderate beard and if I have to</li>
            <li> and like a previous commenter stated, i may go out and buy a nice bottle of scotch after writing this with all the money i am saving.</li>
            <li> Not for me, apparently I have the most sensitive face on the planet.</li>
            <li> These blades are all individually wrapped in a paper sleeve and held together in plastic boxes in sets of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, easy to change.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would change blades every weekend, but sometimes a blade would last two weeks or more without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Derby 100 count box comes in individual packages of 5 blades so they are easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them with a  merkur future and merkur long handle and they seem to be good to use once and then throw away.</li>
            <li> I have a medium coarse beard and get a full weeks worth</li>
            <li> I find that my wet-shaving experience is best when I use a little baby oil before lathering up, much less irritation.</li>
            <li> people complain certain model blades are &amp;</li>
            <li> This requires 4 passes with each pass skipping certain areas.</li>
            <li> Some people swear by certain brands and avoid all others.</li>
            <li> even after 2-3 shaves the edge is better in a feather than a brand new Derby, I ended up giving these away to my local barber.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand before via Amazon and the previous purchase was far superior.</li>
            <li> Able to easily cut through thick hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> These are my first razors and they are extremely sharp, probably not the sharpest but for the price they are miles better than cartridges</li>
            <li> He wears a beard and only trims so they should do fine.</li>
            <li> and the rest stay in their nice little box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how many guys do not know that ALL double edge razor blades are designed for single use only.</li>
            <li> Blades are made in Turkey and are consistent high quality.</li>
            <li> I got 3 good shaves out it before it started to get dull.</li>
            <li> really these blades aren&#x27;t very high quality.</li>
            <li> and these really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it once he passed the learning curve of this type of razor.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> They shave very close</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Derby!</li>
            <li> nothing really to complain about.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well.  </li>
            <li> here I come haha</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Definitely can acquire a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Used these blades before and really like them.</li>
            <li> I use them to shave my head and a straight razor on my face</li>
            <li> For face shaving I recommend staying with the stainless blades, but for my head shaves, these seem to cause fewer scalp nicks.</li>
            <li> just be careful when you shave with those :)</li>
            <li> Cheap enough to throw away after a use or two as well!</li>
            <li> In fact, the edges are numbered and can be rotated four times -- each edge of each side -- if you really want to stretch them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start with this: I think razor blade reviews can be very misleading.</li>
            <li> very  close shave</li>
            <li> would recommend getting Cremo  Cream  works very well for a  close shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Quattro gives a very close shave but the Derby blade in the Edwin Jagger beats it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in nicks, being every so often.</li>
            <li> If you are paying $8+ for 4 cartridges of those &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors, you are absolutely being ripped off.  </li>
            <li> and you will be amazed at how much money you are saving.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> They cut well, wonder if the feather&#x27;s will be to much for my skin.</li>
            <li> , I shave daily, and I lather and shave lightly 3 times each shaving session.  </li>
            <li> The blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, all contained in a box, and if my beard was a bit softer, they would be an absolute steal of a deal.</li>
            <li> The price of 100 is so much cheaper than the Mach III that I was suing before along with giving me no razor burns.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> , they work very well.</li>
            <li> I use these when I&#x27;m rushed and need a very forgiving blade.</li>
            <li> Saves so much money.</li>
            <li> Plus since I dont re-use the blades, my face doesnt break out as much.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair</li>
            <li> I feel these blades give not only a close shave but a comfortable one as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Up til now the only time i have ever had a baby smooth shave was at the barber.</li>
            <li> These last two being as important for me as the blades.</li>
            <li> Some are very aggressive and some are very relaxed.  </li>
            <li> but these are a very close (pun intended</li>
            <li> That is why it is so important to try different blades, aftershaves, etc.</li>
            <li> A real winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Straight edges with no Burrs.  </li>
            <li> How much would someone spend on Mach III cartridges in the course of a year?</li>
            <li> I really like the Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate the savings over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> They are also very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is why I really like the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Want better..buy a straight razor..</li>
            <li> Very forgiving.</li>
            <li> If I ever run out of these, haha, I&#x27;ll stick with Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Now I know that everyone is different, but these blades are forgiving and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I started off with Merkur which gave me a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li> Stick with Feather blades because these do not cut very well.</li>
            <li> One problem I had, was the pack of 100 arrived with the top of the package crushed, and 5 of the plastic packets inside were severly damaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot tell much difference.</li>
            <li> It looks like it is going to be about a while before I can really compare blades</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know - these are all I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> These blades are very forgiving...</li>
            <li> It takes several passes to get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really all a matter of perfecting my stroke...</li>
            <li> At the same time, these are cheap blades</li>
            <li> A pack of 100 blades really is a quarter of a year supply with a beard like mine.</li>
            <li> They probably could have lasted longer but at the price, I really don&#x27;t see a reason to continue using a blade after a week.</li>
            <li> But I suspect people who never learned to shave properly and have been using modern tech type razors, that are far more forgiving, you may have problems.  </li>
            <li> &quot; videos on You Tube before trying anything like these real blades.</li>
            <li> Some may even need sharper ones out there but its really a matter of preference, beard thickness and depends on the type of skin</li>
            <li> When I retired from the military I was able to let my beard grow for a change.  </li>
            <li> I wish the blades were sharper as I have to make three passes to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rust as fast as the Sharks, for that matter.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Scored the whole box for $5 on sale too.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the blades, with light stropping, give me two solid weeks of close shaves.</li>
            <li> Each face &amp; attitude differs, so it&#x27;s really subjective, relative&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for providing&lt;br /&gt;them @</li>
            <li> They would probably last for 3 or 5 shaves, but they are so cheap</li>
            <li> much sharper and a cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> I even use it for my own womanly purposes and I haven&#x27;t had a shave like that from regular razors.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword is a bit better in that they will last me nearly a week, but not quite as smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as with most razors, they&#x27;re harsh fresh.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enought to complete a full face shave!  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly coarse beard with sensitive fair Irish skin.  </li>
            <li> As I am using double edge safety razor for the first time, I found the razor is mild and a second pass against the grain will give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild blade that doesn&#x27;t dull too quickly for me, I am getting 3 shaves per side, or a total of six shaves per blade</li>
            <li> These Derby Extra blades have a coating of platinum, chromium, tungsten and other polymers to make the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These blades are super cheap and sharp!  </li>
            <li> I find these blades to be a good value for the price and also fairly similar to other blades I have used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my razor or these blades, but while one side gives a nice shave the other side sits too far off the face.</li>
            <li> The head is heavy enough to give a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and can be used for at least 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the prompt service and an awesome</li>
            <li> You may have to try blades from different makers to find one that&#x27;s right for your face - these are right for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never gotten a nick on my face (have to be much more careful when I shave my head!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t change blades more often, or longer, but think about it , what a bargain!</li>
            <li> Like many of you I tried some other brands, e.g. Merkur and Astra blades</li>
            <li> I like these much better than Shark or other blades</li>
            <li> I ordered these when I started DE shaving and they were okay but seems not as sharp as they could be.</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s are my favorite because they are not as ninja sharp as feather&#x27;s or merkur&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I also feel like these give me razor burn much more than other razors.</li>
            <li> Are there better DE blades out there by other manufacturers?  </li>
            <li> but they do irritate my face if i do not shave more then every other day.</li>
            <li> and somedays the blades work better then other days.</li>
            <li> The blades last about a week long and work as good as any other name brand that I can find, if you use a old safety razor these fit the bill!</li>
            <li> Better than Astra, Shark and some other brand I tried.</li>
            <li> This proved to be true, but even as I&#x27;ve gotten better, I&#x27;m still having a hard time with these blades.  </li>
            <li> Short of a cut-throat razor, I&#x27;ve never had this clean a shave before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem to get a clean shave on him, and each blade seems to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard of others like the BIC or Red Persona an Israeli company that makes middle of the road blades are suitable for people who may have thicker beards.  </li>
            <li> When buying in this kind of bulk, you will have enough blades for a long time, and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They do an adequate job of shaving, but after about three days of usage, they seem to miss a lot of spots.. they&#x27;re certainly inexpensive enough to replace every three days -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t nick easily on the first shave like the sharpest, higher-end blades sometimes do, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dull quickly either.  </li>
            <li> Great razor blades, very sharp, be careful /</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp and give a very smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Super cheap if you&#x27;re not trying to waste money on Gillette cartridge razors</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find this kind a baled any more at your local drugstore or the big name cvs and walgreens.  </li>
            <li> These blades work very nice, but keep in mind they are not known as being as sharp as other blades.</li>
            <li> I got these a long with a Lord razor and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear.</li>
            <li> These blades are fair for the first shave but don&#x27;t make it much past the third</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using DE blades for about 6 mos after 30 years with various more &#x27;modern&#x27; cartridge style blades.</li>
            <li> Derby seems very middle of the road and left me with a good shave without the occasional nick.</li>
            <li> With modern Bonded Blades costing so much shaving with an old fashion safety razor using the Derby Blades is a real cost saver.</li>
            <li> The reason I have given them 5 stars is that I have a full beard and extremely coarse hair</li>
            <li> Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, and I have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> They are not dull, but the Astra blades I bought were much nicer.</li>
            <li> Derby is hands down my favorite blade.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that they dont have the closest shave and tug a little bit at my hair but other than that they work great!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use they are still shaper and smoother than a new Gillette out of the box!</li>
            <li> At this price, I can pretend I am a millionaire and use a new blade with each shave!  </li>
            <li> - see you in two years when I need to order a new supply!</li>
            <li> New people to DE shaving should not rate these blades until they have had enough time to become familiar with the shaving technique.</li>
            <li> Derby razor blades are a super buy, and are super sharp!  </li>
            <li> Feather - Very sharp but seemed to make me take more passes to get all the beard cut.  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use them for more than 2 shaves, but I have very thick stubble and very soft skin that cuts easy, so you may get more use than I</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable ( no pulling, almost no cuts), very close, long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> 100 blades of this quality for such a small price, simply amazing!</li>
            <li> , they Irritate my skin a slight bit more than Wilkinson.  </li>
            <li> Just this morning I switched to a Wilkinson Sword Blade and I have to say the shave was noticeably better, and the irritation was noticeably less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that gets slightly closer, more nicks, with 8-10 shaves per blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sort of banking on it to start shaving with a decent soap, and had to rely on my shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I thought I found a decent Derby blade among the bunch, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li> They gave me more nicks and an overall rougher shave than the personna and gillete 7 o&#x27;clock yellow blades, which are my favorites</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to shave with these more than once or twice before shaving goes from uncomfortable to downright intolerable.</li>
            <li> I purchased some Wilkinson Sword blades, which are about 50% more expensive, and got a much better shave.</li>
            <li> After you buy a decent safety razor, I guess you can save money using these blades.</li>
            <li> Derby blades seem to be of decent quality, and for someone with a lighter beard than mine</li>
            <li> This combination is a great for beginners but always shave slowly, let the weight of DE89Lbl do the work and in short stroke.</li>
            <li> They give me a decent shave without nicking or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as a first blade to use for the first timer like me.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this stick of 100 will last me a couple of years for the cost of two premium multi-blade cartridges that will last me at most two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive razors, but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> And the blades will most likely last me a year!  </li>
            <li> this is a lot better than paying $25 for four of those 5 blade razors that only last one shave.</li>
            <li> Best deal around I have to shave everyday for work with the blades I save at least 10 dollars per week</li>
            <li> If not I will go back to the merkur super.</li>
            <li> its just a couple of bucks more expensive, go with a better quality razor.</li>
            <li> These will be my main blades now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the blades were damaged as a result of this, as I haven&#x27;t tried those particular blades as yet.</li>
            <li> I agree with many others that getting the correct wet shave is trial &amp; error marked with some blood sacrifice.</li>
            <li> All these blades were decent and did the job</li>
            <li> Some blades in the pack were great and lasted up to 2 weeks, but others were a bit rough after a few days.</li>
            <li> These blades are good for my sensitive skin and and since I don&#x27;t have a thick beard - it suits my needs.  </li>
            <li> They are not the sharpest blade I have encountered but give a very smooth shave with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li> have a 24 pack of derby&#x27;s and a 4 pack of shark super stainless that I would like to trade for any other brand if anybody is interested.</li>
            <li> It is safe to say I have a pretty thick bear, and even after a few days of not shaving at all, these razors &#x27;wipe&#x27; the hair off very easily.</li>
            <li> A great alternate to the very expensive disposable blades most guys buy.</li>
            <li> Love this blade new to the DE community and is only the 2nd I&#x27;ve tried next to shark super chrome.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I switched from high priced razors to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> and it was highly rated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I can get at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaving for one blade by making sure to clean the blade and all the shaver parts and then dry them.  </li>
            <li> If you have started using a safety razor I highly recommend trying these blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , I can get a BBM shave readily with three light passes and a few advanced passes over key areas.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I further read where it would be better to get a 100 pack of blades of only one brand and work on your shaving technique as you are new to this type of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this is very similar performance to all other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> I guess my face and neck are more sensitive than other guys.  </li>
            <li> They are very smooth, without nicks or cuts... and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I believe that these particular razor blades last much longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried; however, they&#x27;re priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> The 200 count is a little better buy.</li>
            <li> I now get 100 blades for just a little more than I used to pay for 10 blades.</li>
            <li> They last just as long, are sharp, and feel great.</li>
            <li> Better then merkur by a little.</li>
            <li> The blades barely cut through my wife&#x27;s baby fine leg hair, and gave her all-over shave burn she hasn&#x27;t had in years using a properly shaped double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use  </li>
            <li> I will also say that these blades are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Merkurs are good but dull too quick and Feathers are too sharp for me and result in razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people gave these blades a bad rating, I think they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> shave with a &amp;#34;Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The old school razor works just as well as the modern 4 blade cartridges and the blades</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a very well trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li> Better buying these then the 2 pack for nearly the same price and only 10 blades.</li>
            <li> I normally get 3-4 days out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the flip side is that they won&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as some more aggressive blades, but a &amp;#34;closer shave&amp;#34; will look like this one in a few hours anyway, so it isn&#x27;t the biggest deal.</li>
            <li> I usually get a couple good shaves out of each one as I do with any double edge blades.</li>
            <li> I shaved like I normally would, up/down and sideways.  </li>
            <li> I STARTED USING FEATHERS, BUT I SUFFERED TOO MANY SKIN IRRITATIONS AND NICKS IN THE TROUBLE AREAS.</li>
            <li> I am able to get four shaves per blade and have what is considered a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> When letting it go for too long for 5 or more days, the double, triple and even the quadruple bladed cartridges razors could not cut through the forrest.  </li>
            <li> The normal techniques didn’t work well</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;ve got a fairly normal beard</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave, but not a great one.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t my favorite blades because I prefer a very sharp one, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and these seemed to get high reviews for the price.  </li>
            <li> Too dull for my face, but they&#x27;re SUPER cheap if they work for you.</li>
            <li> In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li> After testing several other more expensive brands, I found that inexpensive Derby was the best and longest lasting blade.  </li>
            <li> they are not dull, but the packaging is overly conservative on the part of safety.</li>
            <li> The blades come in smaller packs inside the box, so easy to store in our tiny bathroom, in the medicine chest.</li>
            <li> Be careful how you dispose of old blades, as they can easily slice through trash bags and cut someone.  </li>
            <li> They went right back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> and he has to get rid of it right away and go to the next one in the box.</li>
            <li> I can easily cut the neck hair in 5 strokes at most and the blade just feels less harsh than the Derby.</li>
            <li> These blades are stunningly sharp and give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s on the other hand are plenty sharp and glide across my face leaving a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> There is no denying that this is cheap, but I was hoping them to be a little bit sharper since it doesn&#x27;t really give me that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> Not all are smooth and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I save the original wrapping for disposal as I have curious cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are smooth, sharp, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and comfortable to shave.</li>
            <li> This blade is not as sharp as some others, which may suit your needs if you have light to medium growth or are learning how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li> but it must just be because i live in michigan.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still trying out new blades.</li>
            <li> my new choice of razor blade/ shaving system..</li>
            <li> I use a new blade every Monday morning.  </li>
            <li> got these for his new razor to keep him well shaved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to De razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this blade to anyone who is new to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> so going to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blade.</li>
            <li> New to Safety Razors and just went with these as part of a suggestion package.  </li>
            <li> someone new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> I use them about twice (to shave my legs) and then switch it out for a new one...</li>
            <li> but when delivered don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> My new DE shaver included a starter pack of these blades.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend that if you&#x27;re new to shaving you try a variety pack...</li>
            <li> But, lets face it, for the price, you could use a brand new razor every time you shave.</li>
            <li> During the summer, I shave my arms, legs and chest, and I can get away with using a blade one time on my legs and a new blade each time I shave my arms and chest.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t work as well new.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brand again.</li>
            <li> I just grab a new one every time.</li>
            <li> so I can just grab a new 5 pack out from under the sink whenever</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades do a good job, but they seem to dull faster then the Shark Double Edge blades I used up.</li>
            <li> The key with these babies is to change the blades every day (which I certainly don&#x27;t mind doing for the price!).  </li>
            <li> that I bought such a large amount of them!  </li>
            <li> The Derby blades are easy on my skin, with much less irritation than the cartridge blades, and work well in both razors, though I favor the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> The Derbys are very forgiving and gave me the same quality, close shave that i get with the Feather blades but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A Derby Extra razor blade was included free with my recently purchased Muhle R41 safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The second and third shave was fantastic.</li>
            <li> , this pack of blades will easily last a year; and if you use proper technique (wet-shaving with soap and brush, not with canned foam), you will get as close and comfortable a shave as with any multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> Double edge blades are no longer available in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I went back to a double edge razor and a good brush, shaving mug and Mama Bear brand soaps about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> At the price, compared to plastic razors, this singular purchase has saved me enough to make the conversion to wet shaving a money saving plan (and a better shave)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None however will get 1 star as its such a personal fit</li>
            <li> Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  </li>
            <li> Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  </li>
            <li> these blades are really good as long as you use proper shave soap and keep your face wet!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive  skin and want a bbs  shave.</li>
            <li> This was a terrific deal ,very economic.</li>
            <li> If you are young and no one ever taught you how to shave properly, I highly recommend you watch some \\&quot;how to\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having a very coarse beard, I like a more aggressive razor such as a Gillette red tip, with a sharp blade for light strokes.</li>
            <li> this is a very dull blade was not as smooth clean cut as i thought</li>
            <li> the many good reviews, I wonder whether I simply got a bad batch or whether this company spends</li>
            <li> Sure, some of the other blades I tried seemed sharper but that was of no benefit and the only time I have ever had a nick/cut from shaving was from those blades.</li>
            <li> People usually say how many shaves a blade lasts for.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of reading on blades before settling on these as my first double edge bade to start shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> By far, the sharpest blades I have ever had in 40 years!  </li>
            <li> I still have many of the other blades left</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m Asian American (so you better understand the facial hair).</li>
            <li> First box of razors I&#x27;ve purchased for traditional shaving</li>
            <li> Only on my first one.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson - cut myself 3 times on the first shave and twice on the second shave.  </li>
            <li> In the past, this would lead to razor burn and more nicks, but I&#x27;ve not had that problem with these razor blades.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying smaller batch first.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer a hot washcloth.  </li>
            <li> My priorities in a blade are skin protection first, cut whiskers second.  </li>
            <li> Good all round blade for someone just starting out on DE shaving, but order a sample pack with different blades to try before you order 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay sharp longer than a few uses save your money buy a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> Cheap and sharp!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The blades are sharp and provide a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My father complemented me on my clean shave the other day.</li>
            <li> I realize different people have different shaving styles and different faces, but I can only rate these on my own experience, and I don&#x27;t plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> Not to the point where they are unusable, but a marked difference in shave quality from a new blade.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying derby blades remember they are one of the less aggressive blades available, so</li>
            <li> At a bulk price of less than 10 cents per blade, they are as close to free as you will ever get.  </li>
            <li> Cause irritation and dulls quickly</li>
            <li> Being a life long DE wet shaver, I have tried many blades.</li>
            <li> I for one normally get at least 4 shaves out of one blade, and even then I could probably get two more if I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that tends to have razor bumps so far no issue.</li>
            <li> Good bade for everyday use or beginning the wet shave experience!!</li>
            <li> when you can spend less than $8.00 and get a high quality shave for almost a full year.</li>
            <li> That first box of 100 blades lasted for nearly four years, much longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very sharp and they served their purpose - an opportunity for me to learn how to shave safely with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Never the less, I tried the others just to be sure and the blade that I keep going back to is the Derby.</li>
            <li> If I make sure to dry off the blade well, and don&#x27;t make a bunch of extra passes trying to get difficult areas super smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack of various manufacturers several months ago to try in my 60&#x27;s Super Speed.</li>
            <li> One thing that did help him tremendously in the beginning was watching a YouTube video on how to shave properly with a safety razor (the technique is different from a throw away).  </li>
            <li> I love the Derby&#x27;s--not too dull , not too sharp, but just right!</li>
            <li> Also quite environmentally friendly packaging compared to other disposable cartridges!</li>
            <li> For those given to worrying about the environment or just wishing to live more simply, the method just described produces no non-recyclable waste.  </li>
            <li> every few shaves, these work just fine.</li>
            <li> Not sure how other people write good reviews...</li>
            <li> I have to use certain facial lotions</li>
            <li> The cost of these blades have certainly saved me over $100 in traditional cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves in, I grew so fed up with the Feathers that mid-shave I actually swapped to my last Derby blade, and finished up with no problems and super smooth</li>
            <li> Too dull for me and leaves too many nicks.</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur Classic DE Razor and either Proraso, Colonel Conk or a locally made vegetarian shave soap, an Omega badger hair brush and try to shave only after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s hard to argue with 100 blades for under $8), but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave as well.  </li>
            <li> Bit too dull for my Edwin Jagger DE razor - nice blade but not for me personally.</li>
            <li> I am totally new to DE shaving, but after reading and researching for hours on all this new-fangled old fashioned shaving stuff, I finally settled on asking for this particular blade as a gift to go with the Edwin Jagger DE87 on my gift list.  </li>
            <li> The hair on one&#x27;s head is typically much finer than that of a beard, so the blades last far longer for that than they ever did with my face.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got a thick, heavy beard, so anything that can stand up to that is a GREAT razor.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra is working very well in my Merkur 38D.</li>
            <li> Started using an Old Timer razor and after checking out reviews on Amazon, I went with these.</li>
            <li> I bought an old fashioned handle and put these blades in.  </li>
            <li> I really like the shave they provide and will stick with these blades for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I am feeling like these are giving me a shave of about the same quality as a straight razor shave for me.</li>
            <li> At 56 years old, and shaving for 40 years I learned that DO NOT GET</li>
            <li> I have the dreaded combination of ultra sensitive skin and stubble with the consistency of steel wool.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I realized that once I made the initial investment in a safety razor, it would be much cheaper to buy double-edged replacement blades for it than to continue to buy the disposable shavers that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through three razors so far</li>
            <li> but I prefer this one as it fits my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with a safety razor for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much cheaper than buying regular razor sets.</li>
            <li> They were supposed to provide a very close shave with fewer passes (With the Derby&#x27;s I was going with the grain, across then against to achieve relatively close to BBS)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, After much research, I&#x27;m using the Derbys at a rate of one a week.</li>
            <li> OK, so we&#x27;re not dealing with complex equipment.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> WoW......</li>
            <li> so far has lasted my 6 shaves (about a month)</li>
            <li> I went straight to these with shaving soap, and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li> far the one blade I have loaded into my Gillette has lasted me for about eight shaves.</li>
            <li> I shave sporadically, so I go from smooth to scruffy, every few days.  </li>
            <li> Get these blades and convert to old school shaving.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd shave I attained BBS on my cheeks and very close to BBS below my neck.  </li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> The blades that came with my razor are lasting very well</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thanks to the exorbitant cost of blades for Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 and Quattro I decided to return to a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still saving considerable money over the cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really now, how can they make such a precision product at under 8 cents a blade, sharpened, wrapped, packaged, and labeled?</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and purchased these after using up some Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Prepare shave to make it soft and raised.  </li>
            <li> These blades do the trick for my hyper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver is able to make several passes over the same areas with minimal to zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I then purchased a Merkur 34C HD and removed the blade from the old razor and put it into the Merkur, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> very satisfed with them equal to if not exceeding  wilkinson&#x27;s</li>
            <li> takes some patience to get a shave if you do not prep by unboxing and unboxing and doing at least one more</li>
            <li> Every blade is packaged separately and wrapper can be used to dispose old blade.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to others looking to complete their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> If your looking to get into straight razor shaving (which uses double edge safety blades) or safety razor shaving this is recommended.</li>
            <li> and I have to tell by far the feather edge holds for longer and shaves smoother,</li>
            <li> The last time I used a straight raiser was when I was a teenager going through my grandfather&#x27;s bathroom drawers looking for a razor to shave.  </li>
            <li> I am getting the closest shave doing the old fashioned technique of shaving than I have ever gotten before in my life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a ton of facial hair</li>
            <li> Arrived 5 days early.</li>
            <li> EVEN THOSE TOOK TOO MUCH SKIN OFF AFTER MULTIPLE PASSES.</li>
            <li> TO STICK WITH THEM BECAUSE MY SKIN IS TOO SENSITIVE FOR THE SHARPEST BLADES</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband, and so far he has had no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three brands of DE blade from Amazon so far, and these are by far my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> Yes I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> tried these blades on 3 different safety razors - e.g., the very forgiving Merkur 34C.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different, but these work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use an old glass jelly jar.  </li>
            <li> but the Derby blades were my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> The blades are individually wrapped in 5-pack plastic holders which makes them really convenient for travelling.</li>
            <li> After 15 years away from the DE scene I recently went back to it, partly to save my aged, sun damaged skin from the multi-blade scraping of cartridge razors and partly because I just couldn&#x27;t see the value in $16.95 for 5 more cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I found my grandpas&#x27; old clam razor.  </li>
            <li> Saves a lot of money as compared to the price of the standard modern razor.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And you will be doing it the old style.</li>
            <li> They maintain a good edge and one blade, properly cleaned, will last for at least a week or longer.  </li>
            <li> but if I cut myself all the time what good is it.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to stick to the more expensive blades, at least I save on bandages.</li>
            <li> buy these with a safety razor, and you will have long time supply of good blades; these come in individual plastic containers ( each with a small number of blades.)</li>
            <li> This is a year worth of smooth shaving for less than $10!!!!.</li>
            <li> but I usually shave with a new one every time since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t overly scalpel sharp to where I worry about putting them next to my soft, fragile, handsome face.  </li>
            <li> Basically over two years of good quality shaving for less than one small package of disposable, environmentally traitorous disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp or long-lasting as Feather, but they are more forgiving of poor technique or bumpy skin and produce a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cut and dry product here.</li>
            <li> I have been using my razor for about 2 weeks, I used one blade for about 2 weeks now and still have the one, they might be cheap but they sure last long, I shave every day, and my hair is thick, totally recommend this blades...</li>
            <li> must say, though, that to get the super close shave that I like, with any setup, I have to use my free hand to feel for rough patches, reapply soap, pull the skin tight, and then work those areas in multiple directions/</li>
            <li> it will keep the blades clean of bacteria and will be less chances of acne, DE razor shaving removes dead skin clean your blades and they will last derby  blades prices are unbeatable and to me they arr the exact same as feather</li>
            <li> These caused the least irritation and cut very easily even on the second stroke.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to review Amazon products, but I felt that this was good enough to break me from my stereotypical apathy.</li>
            <li> Previously I have been able to get a week of shaves with a single razor</li>
            <li> I am new to double edge saftey razor shaving and so far it has been a blast shaving !</li>
            <li> I just felt they weren&#x27;t very sharp and didn&#x27;t last more than one shave on my 20 grit facial hair....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as murkur razors but at this price you can afford to use a fresh one for each shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone, as they last longer and seem to cut better than any disposable I&#x27;ve ever used, along with being a small fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First pass with the grain, second pass across the grain, and third pass against the grain.</li>
            <li> When I initially started shaving with Double edge razor blades, I bought several sampler packs (which have a bunch of different brands) and spent a lot of time deciding which brand I liked.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent deal.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews of assorted blades and it seems each handle/blade combination works differently with each unique beard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still not half way through this pack.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of blades, made necessary by the diminishing supply of blades from my initial kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> use each blade only once, not sure how many times you can, in theory, use each.</li>
            <li> I also heat a mug of water as my tap water meets the current building code for temperature, which means it isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> razor is forgiving enough that you won&#x27;t cut yourself if you press a little too hard, but is still sharp enough to give you a very nice tug free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you choose sharper blades such as with Japanese Feather blades - super sharp - you will slice your face up unless you experience with DE blades and know how to use your technique very well.</li>
            <li> However after shaving with Feathers for a couple of weeks and switching to the Derby&#x27;s last week I can say for sure that these blades are just as good for me as the Feathers are (with the added bonus of being even less expensive!)</li>
            <li> The variables are endless and find the right combination is trial and error.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taking into account the low price, I would highly recommend these razors.</li>
            <li> However, I switched to personna blades which are more expensive, but they are much sharper and seem to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps razor blades were proportionally more expensive back in the 20s or 30s; perhaps, however, they never sold really well and were an old-fashioned version of the modern contraptions you see on midnight infomercials</li>
            <li> /&gt;He says he highly recommends them to anyone who uses double edge razors!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp but smooth and forgiving at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have an old Gillette Ball-End razor, but also bought a new Merkur HD, and also the Derby blades based on reading about various blades on line.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave very little nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> Hubby shaves three times going in different directions and has a very close, smooth shave (and he has a thick beard).  </li>
            <li> , then the fourth shave I sometimes have to change out mid shave because it is not cutting well enough.</li>
            <li> Compare the price of these to a normal replaceable blade schick or gillette for the same amount of time!</li>
            <li> So sharp in fact that left my sensitive face and neck smooth but extremely red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> these blades are alright, ive gone through about 15 of them now, and i can use them for about 2 shaves per blade normally flipping the blade for the second shave.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves were extremely sharp, and each one lasted a full week of daily shaving.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected based on the review I read before the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Those with thick, full bears might want to trim first or just get a different blade altogether.</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with an Edwin jagger de89lbl and Taylor of old bond street sandlewood shaving cream they are very sharp and get the job done right.</li>
            <li> They will last a long time before I have to buy more and really sharp!</li>
            <li> Ok, after all the hype I&#x27;ve read about the exotic expensive blades, I bought a major sampling to see what I had been missing.</li>
            <li> They have a very smooth cutting edge compared to other blades( particularly the Merkur blade that has a sandpaper like edge) , thus the provide a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive been using safety razors for the last several years and have finally found the right razor blade.</li>
            <li> While they all easily outperform every commercial market razor blade (the disposable cartridges with 4-5 dull blades type) out there, the DE razor blade types certainly can be a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about beard reduction with each easy pass (rather than beard removal in one chiselfest), going with the grain, and not pressing hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> Each one is individually packed in a set of 5 in a hard plastic case, much better than what I had before.  </li>
            <li> and get a new one for the next shave.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing a sampler pack if you are new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband and his new double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Those of you that are new at wetshaving or shaving with a safety razor must know that blades work differently for everyone.  </li>
            <li> Nothing gets a closer shave for my face than a brand new Derby Extra.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my mach III before the new blades arrived from Japan.  </li>
            <li> get a variety pack if your new to double edges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a new blade as often as others and each blade can last around 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, I can live with tossing 1 out of every 10 blades within a week.</li>
            <li> find when the blade is fresh, the first usage causes me a couple of cuts it is so sharp I would say almost too sharp!</li>
            <li> I really like these blades after not using a double edge razor since I was in basic training in 1967.</li>
            <li> All I can think is their beards are wispy soft blonde angel hair, because these things cut like a 4 year old Feather blade after 300 shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically you get a decades worth for less than $10.</li>
            <li> Thus far,  I have sampled the following razors:  Personna - decent shave but not the sharpest though they last about a week before there is a noticeable drop in performance.  </li>
            <li> They may not work for super heavy beards, but for my not so heavy facial hair gets shaved off smoothly and without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately before buying read only the good reviews.</li>
            <li> blades themselves are just dull enough to allow for varied pressure but not sharp enough to shave cleanly in the first pass.</li>
            <li> Switched to single razor and now i shave every day no razor burn plus so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with a single pass, no irritation, no nicks or cuts, no reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li> One of the edges is completely fine, but the other is rough and chafing.</li>
            <li> These work fine though they dull after 4-5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if they dont work well for you, you can do like I do and keep them as back ups for when you unexpectedly run out of blades!</li>
            <li> They are decently sharp and do exactly as needed when you pop them in.  </li>
            <li> They feel sturdy and are sharp, which is exactly what I need in a razor.</li>
            <li> but believe you me, these blades can still cut you if not careful!</li>
            <li> These blades are super dull, they constantly wear out quick and pull on the regular, spend the extra money on feather or astra.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp enough to cut me, but not sharp enough to cleanly shave.</li>
            <li> In less than one year, I have gone through more than half of the blades in the box.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse heavy beard that requires daily shaving and after even several days of neglect, the Derby&#x27;s cut right through it smoothly with no difficulties or drag.</li>
            <li> I do not have a strong beard and this is the first time that I encounter new blades pulling rather than cutting hair.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, they cut down hairs with a smooth finesse, and they&#x27;re far cheaper than cartridges.</li>
            <li> These blades are like the long handled axe a lumberjack uses to strike hard, blunt, and clean to chop down that mighty oak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my facial hair is not very thick; I&#x27;m 18 years old and my facial hair is still thickening.</li>
            <li> I actually think each blade would last longer than 1 week, but since they are so cheap I figure why not splurge a little, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can live with a little tug and pull as long as I&#x27;m getting clean and irritation-free daily shaves.</li>
            <li> They shave fine, my only complaint would be that they get dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> Get an occasional bad one but for the most part I enjoy these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What may be helpful for people in general is to try is a sampler pack, which you can find online by searching for DE Blade Sampler Packs.  </li>
            <li> Balanced, plenty sharp for a comfortable shave, but not tooo sharp.  </li>
            <li> Last as long as the expensive german blades, at a great price.</li>
            <li> It could be my facial hair, it could be my razor, but so far I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly sensitive face, and these blades last me</li>
            <li> But for kicks one day in the store I decided to try a pack of regular old Wilkinson blades from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have used this blade for only two shaves so far.</li>
            <li> I have a medium coarse beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Of course, I haven&#x27;t tested all 100 of them, but all of the nine or ten I have tried so far have been defective.</li>
            <li> I am 61 yrs old &amp; started shaving with double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Lords trio of blades, and found them all to give me a shave that wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as the Derby, and they always left razor rash.</li>
            <li> but for a beginner wet shaver they&#x27;re very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I can barely feel the blade removing my beard...</li>
            <li> I have only used one of these blades so far</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I ever bought when I started wet shaving with a double edged razor, and in all honesty, I have never used another brand.</li>
            <li> Among these, derby is the worst by far and astras are by far the best for my face.</li>
            <li> blades were okay for some areas of my face, but I&#x27;d get an average of 3-5 cuts per pass in my trouble areas...</li>
            <li> I would like to say if the blades themselves are better or worse than others.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp.</li>
            <li> They offer a consistent product that hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> On the standard of one blade a week (you may use more or less I suppose), I figure I&#x27;ve got about two years of shaves for less than $15.00.  </li>
            <li> While they are slightly flimsy, once you put it in your safety razor it will not be evident anymore.</li>
            <li> Have used Wilkinson Sword in the past and these blade are not as sharp, however the trade off is that I can be more agressive when shaving.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough for a pretty close shave, and at this price, you can toss after a couple shaves without wasting tons of money.</li>
            <li> Using these with the traditional safety razor for the first time i cut myself a lot, and these blades were so i sharp</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and really really sharp.</li>
            <li> I have said in other reviews, blade reviews are very subjective and</li>
            <li> Really flimsy compared to every other blade I have tried.</li>
            <li> TL;DR: Cheap and plentiful blades to learn with, but not very sharp and won&#x27;t last for thick</li>
            <li> They last a good long time but won&#x27;t cut you to peaces if you press just a little too hard, either.</li>
            <li> you have coarse facial hair, steer clear of these blades.</li>
            <li> My 2nd favorite blades behind Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp enough even for one time use.</li>
            <li> These blades were not sharp enough to give me a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> I would use them again if I had them and no other blades, but would not likely ever purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is likely not due to the fact that the blade is super sharp because compared to all other it is not.  </li>
            <li> Second, right out the box it felt like I was shaving with a butter knife, and my beard isnt that heavy.</li>
            <li> While I get done faster with the Feather, I don&#x27;t actually get a closer shave, and generally do get irritation.</li>
            <li> One side of the blade is marked 1,2 and the other side is marked 3,4, so you can rotate the side of the blade used.  </li>
            <li> my drug store barely stocks double edge blades never in these quantity stock up save money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 5 blades so far in about 3 months shaving every 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
            <li> So I bought an old school double edge razor and a big box of Derby Extra blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and purchase higher quality blades.</li>
            <li> I have bought half a dozen razor blades to test before I bought a large quantity.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and have a decent life.</li>
            <li> I find these to be sharp enough to give a close shave on a daily basis but not irritating after 2 separate passes in the morning.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp, last a long time, and the price for the quantity can&#x27;t really be beat!</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I have / tried using for a double edge razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are new to using these, they take some getting used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving then you may want to start with these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> High quality product which stays sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you can do with the cash saved just from not having to buy ridiculously expensive razors all year long.</li>
            <li> Then I started breaking them in half and using them with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for less than the cost of two on the modern blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> The blades are reasonably priced less than 10 cents a blade.</li>
            <li> I generally shave twice with them, in opposite directions for an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> The sampler also included two Feather blades which were extremely sharp and difficult to use no matter how careful I was,would not recommend the &amp;#34;Feather Double Edge&amp;#34; .I also purchased the Mekur  double edge razor (on Amazon) great razor.</li>
            <li> I normally buy Wilkinson Sword blades, Derbys cut way easier, however being that they are that sharp</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something more, not sure who to blame (Derby, Amazon or the import service / UPS ) but the package end up missing 10 blades ( 2 sets of 5 ) not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Wet shavers new to double edge shaving should use these blades a their starter blade.</li>
            <li> I tried several different blades, including but not limited to Astra, Wilkinson sword, Feather and 2 off brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these blades are fine!</li>
            <li> This is sharp enough to give me that smooth shave but isn&#x27;t aggressive enough to scrape my skin raw.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a more relaxing shave as you&#x27;re not typically anxious about cutting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only less wasteful method is with a straight razor, but the learning curve is simply too steep for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the little cartridge to hold my used blades.</li>
            <li> for the blade, you get a very close shave with little to no irritation on the skin when doing a three shave pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be much happier if those 5 packs were sub-packed into little cardboard</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and install a new blade every Monday morning</li>
            <li> I have always noticed that sharp new cartridge razors would irritate my neck, but would not once the razor was a bit used/dulled.</li>
            <li> I can not compare these to the other brands out there, however I have not had to order any new blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave as often as some others do.</li>
            <li> How can a company that makes such a fine product have such poor quality control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, so it&#x27;s important I can run the blade over my face several times.</li>
            <li> This blade was very widely used by new shavers.</li>
            <li> nothing worse than a dull razor blade...and a good razor</li>
            <li> Even if they cut you it won&#x27;t hurt, which is either Good or bad</li>
            <li> They seem to be either all good or all bad, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return these.</li>
            <li> These razors are decent, but I feel like they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as any other razor I have had.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I have a fairly thick beard and although these blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as others, they are probably fine for a person with lighter facial hair.</li>
            <li> I know there are other more expensive blades, but unless Derby start lowering there quality, I will stick with them as I have had no problems thus far.</li>
            <li> After doing a side by side comparison with Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Platinums, I determined that these Derby blades were not good for me.</li>
            <li> If you need DE blades and want a lot of high quality blades for a little amount of cash - this is your ONLY bet.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp when new but don&#x27;t seem to last as long as others that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp enough to get a very close shave, but not so sharp that you cut yourself all the time.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews at professional shaving sites that warned of this.</li>
            <li> Sharper by far than Sharks, but not as sharp as Feathers.</li>
            <li> This beats by far the other two blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and these are the just the right amount of sharp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , that is a huge cost savings, particularly if you are used to using Gillette Sensor or one of the other expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> , I turned to Derby and it was like a new dawn.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, 99% less knicks and cuts and bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No razor burn, no cuts as long as you are careful and use a lot of lather (I bought sensitive skin shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad blade but not great either.</li>
            <li> (unless I push too hard- be gentle and don&#x27;t rush!).</li>
            <li> But after that they get pretty dull.</li>
            <li> I thought these razors were pretty dull.</li>
            <li> I have experienced the worst shave since I switched to the new blades and razor</li>
            <li> The price was very competitive and I felt I had very little at risk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derbys fore quite some time now usually with disposable straight razor type</li>
            <li> So the pack will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> They also last a long time because there are 100 of them.</li>
            <li> These&#x27;ll last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> pack of blades along with a Merkur safety razor will save big $$$ over the long run.</li>
            <li> That said, they won&#x27;t last as long as a Merkur or a Feather.  </li>
            <li> The blades shave well and last as long as one would expect.  </li>
            <li> With 100 blades total in 20 separate dispensers, they will be here for a long time.</li>
            <li> i try to use each blade as long as possible.</li>
            <li> These 100 blades should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They should last a long time at these give away prices.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> guess I am not sensitive enough to tell a difference in the blades.</li>
            <li> a Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Razor</li>
            <li> But I have to say 100 blades will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i choose this for times when i have a long growth of facial hair and the multi-blade razors clog after one swipe</li>
            <li> so I can get a pretty thick beard going</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard</li>
            <li> Wow these blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> It took a little practice to go back to using an old fashion Safety Razor</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller).</li>
            <li> Very sharp and no nicks or irritation near the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some reviews talk about how thse blades dont last long, but they forget that they 100 blades for 7 bucks and change!</li>
            <li> But I would certainly give them a try, as long as you don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> I can get enough razors to last me 2 years for $20-$30 and as I stated above I am constantly changing them to get a very sharp</li>
            <li> Will last a very long time....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself, but gets that nice close shave that you&#x27;d expect from a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The sticky adhesive on the back isn&#x27;t so much of a negative doesn&#x27;t really affect the blade edge.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of gent that likes to enjoy his shave, relax and take his time getting that baby-smooth feeling minus the drawbacks of irritating razor burn or unsightly nicks...</li>
            <li> They are so inexpensive that you could change them every day and still spend far less than you would spend on cartridges or disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> After I figured out how to shave properly with a double-edged razor, nicks with these blades are few and far between.</li>
            <li> at roughly a dime a piece, they cost about the same as my Harry&#x27;s cartridges which easily last me two months.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t provide a comparison, but I&#x27;ve been shaving with them for a few months now and have had no trouble with them</li>
            <li> every few shaves, and even after about a year of frequent replacements, there are still plenty left.</li>
            <li> They are not to sharp and the individual blades last long enough to make this a value that is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> You really can only get them in high end shaving shops and they are expensive  </li>
            <li> They are just 8 cents each, you can afford to use them correctly as single use only.</li>
            <li> review is limited to those with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I know, I know, the more expensive Feather blades are still a fraction of the price of cartridges, but after just one shave each blade is going to be dulled down just the same.</li>
            <li> My goal was to end the expensive cartridge blade purchases, and this has been a fine way to do that, along with</li>
            <li> Other cheaper model Derby blades may not have the extra coating, but Derby Extra models have them.</li>
            <li> I still have them, and only by the other disposable ones out of sheer boredom.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough without causing any irritation plus they last me 6-7</li>
            <li> prefer these blades to Dorco and Astra blades (the only other ones I have tried) with my simple 3 piece razor.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different blades of each of these:  Derby, Astra, Bic, Gillette Silver Blue, Gillete 7 O Clock Black, Nacht, Personna and Feather.</li>
            <li> You can put the old used razors in the bottom of the little razor case too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely have any facial hair, just a little moustache fuzz and a bit under the chin.  </li>
            <li> Once they begin to get dull, they really pull.</li>
            <li> They last about five shaves before starting to pull a little, but with 100 that is not a big problem.</li>
            <li> My next purchase, I&#x27;m going to plan on spending a little extra money and go back to the Shark.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but as long as you keep the blade &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t let it get dull</li>
            <li> They do more pulling than cutting.  </li>
            <li> these blades are very forgiving, I can get at least 3 shaves out of one razor</li>
            <li> At first i though i just needed to improve my technique with this blade, but after trying Astra blades, I realized it was that the Derby blade was not a good match for my face.</li>
            <li> Each blade lasts me as long as any bic razor.  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor</li>
            <li> These blades come 5 pieces in a plastic container with an empty slot to used/discarded blades in the back.</li>
            <li> I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  </li>
            <li> Take your time to do a proper wet shave and these will be one of the smoothest blades you&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> need an address to ship them back to for a partial refund</li>
            <li> These are not for me, and after giving it several tries (trying to save face (no pun intended), i pushed through gone 3-4 packs of blades), I reached my breaking point today and called it quits.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> BTW, I;m using the Merkur Long Handle</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ll keep using these as long as I can get my hands on them.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur Model 180 along with these blades, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to need anymore for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> 10 of these blades came with the Utopia Care Long handle Safety Razor that I ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Everyone has a different experience wet shaving, this was mine.</li>
            <li> I spent about $10 on this pack of 100 blades back in August 2012.</li>
            <li> Derby has been my go-to blade for a long time.</li>
            <li> Therefore, ignore comments about how long a blade lasts.</li>
            <li> use a merkur progress long handled razor</li>
            <li> The razors arrived as advertised, they were in a long cardboard box with plastic 5packs inside.</li>
            <li> and with deal on the blades, I am set for quite a long time...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have realized a few things so far.  </li>
            <li> The cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in so long.</li>
            <li> even a week old DE blade is still VERY sharp!  </li>
            <li> I shave only down grain and cross grain.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as a Gillette double edged safety razor blade, but is certainly as sharp, and provides a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought these with my first safety razor; I saw other negative reviews</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for a really long time compared to similar blades, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp long enough to get through a week.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as sharp or last as long as others, however you get a lot of shaves for the price.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp enough to provide me with the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever achieved while at the same time being forgiving enough to perform multiple passes and touch ups with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> These are my \\&quot;go to \\&quot; blades --- the standard to which I hold other blades up to in comparison.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Proviso:  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of double edged razor to compare to.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough before my skin can start feeling it.</li>
            <li> There is a place to dispose of used, but still sharp enough to do damage, blades in the plastic blade container, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about  injury.</li>
            <li> I initially receive them with 5 other brands in a sample blade package.  </li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s last me about 3 or 4 shaves, and I shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple other blades and went back to these.  </li>
            <li> I gave each blade a 2-3 day trial and found that for me, the feather was simply too sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and relatively long-lasting.</li>
            <li> These razors are not the sharpest that I have ever used, nor do they seem to hold what little edge they have past the first 1 or 2 shaves.  </li>
            <li> How can you not like quality, sharp double edge razor blades for $.10 ea?  </li>
            <li> some people say these arent sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Only not all the blades are equally sharp.</li>
            <li> each if it wasn&#x27;t as sharp he only uses it once and throws it out.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and last awhile, but I change it out sooner cause my son loves shaving with that razor too.  </li>
            <li> and I shave my moderate beard every other day.</li>
            <li> What other uses are there for double edge blades?</li>
            <li> I am leaving this review based on only using this blade, not comparing it to other blades.</li>
            <li> These are the first DE blades I&#x27;ve used, and found them to be very dull.</li>
            <li> Im probably going to stick with these for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Derby blades tend to get a bad reputation from the &amp;#34;elitist&amp;#34; shaving community, but as someone who shaves daily, I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better than these blades.</li>
            <li> i do keep them dry and in a dry closet</li>
            <li> DRY THEM OFF AFTER YOU USE THEM.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the closest shave out of all the razors I&#x27;ve used and almost completely eliminates all the negative aspects of shaving such as razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is thin, wirey, and straight; if i grew it out, I would have a fu manchu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch because of the price, but they only seem to last a few (4) shaves.</li>
            <li> I purchased a sampler to try a few different blades including Astra, Feather, Crystal, Personna (red), Merkur and Derby.  </li>
            <li> Only reason for 4 stars is they dull a little fast to me.</li>
            <li> so that means you don&#x27;t cut off every whisker with a single stroke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a single edge razor user.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with these blades along with the super stainless and chrome shark blades.</li>
            <li> I had a very lengthy review from earlier this year but have found these razors to be too dull to have as everyday shaving.  </li>
            <li> so instead of a new pack of replacement blades from the other guy- get a safety razor and some of these blades and it will still save you a little bit of money and your shave will be even smoother!</li>
            <li> I have used Feather blades and they are amazingly sharp, but quite harsh on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If money is tight, these will do the job and there is 100 of them, so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive, and the shipping was not very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like trying to chop an oak tree down with a Japanese katana.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone down to my last blade with these</li>
            <li> , as it turned out the blade was a Feather.&lt;br /&gt;Feather, yellow, is very very very sharp...</li>
            <li> In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, last over a week per blade maybe even 2 weeks</li>
            <li> think some of the negative reviews are from people who may be new to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Trying to use them more than once is neigh on impossible.  </li>
            <li> First shave was so uncomfortable I threw the entire box away.</li>
            <li> shaves for less than ten bucks ..</li>
            <li> I used ASTRA in the past and they seem to be sharper and last longer (I can get four shaves out of one blade) and they are about the same price.</li>
            <li> , Chrome]]They are razor blades so obviously sharp, but probably only as sharp as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I usually get 3-4 uses out of each blade as I only use them to spot shave around my beard several times per week.</li>
            <li> Tortured my half face for ten minutes and gave up.</li>
            <li> At less than 10 cents/blade, even if you change blades daily, they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find that you have to slightly alter how you shave with each different blade, and there are nuances to each type that you&#x27;ll like/dislike.</li>
            <li> I get the same shave, or 13221654x less the price of the Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as sharp as Feather brand, but it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I have a thick course beard and usually shave after 4-5 days worth of growth.</li>
            <li> far as sharpness goes I am not a very good at judge on the quality between blades.</li>
            <li> I shave every single day (in the military</li>
            <li> have extremely thick hair so blades dull quickly for me.</li>
            <li> Botttom line agree with me or not all blades are razor sharp as long as they are platinum coated.</li>
            <li> These razors stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, as long as I switched the blades every other day, it wouldn&#x27;t affect my shave.</li>
            <li> First the razors are really thin and sharp.</li>
            <li> This comes with little 5 razor plastic cases with a total of 100 razors.</li>
            <li> When I lather I spray a little olive oil on parts of face to get extra lubrication.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for $10 they come prepacked in little plastic boxes inside the big cardboard one.</li>
            <li> I suppose there are about 20 little plastic containers in here, that hold 5 blades wrapped in wax paper, with a blade disposal slot in the back of the container.</li>
            <li> It seems that the merker blades last a little longer, but Im still testing.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick, and fast growing beard.  </li>
            <li> Really hard on my sensitive neck.</li>
            <li> However that does not mean that they are not good blades.</li>
            <li> Unless a razor comes damaged, it&#x27;s hard to give a good or bad review.</li>
            <li> I have heard that these tend to be on the mild sharpness scale where as Feather blades are scary sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are somewhat forgiving and last be through several shaves, but do dull out eventually.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many blades and thought, since this brand came with my razor, it couldn&#x27;t be too bad.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who wanted to wet shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave that often, but like a wet shave every now and then.  </li>
            <li> Each blade would last me a few weeks, 3-4 weeks probably.  </li>
            <li> Only negative comment on these blades is that there have been several in the box that have had absolutely no edge to the blade at all and had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> few days ago I decided to try out the Feathers, based off numerous recommendations.</li>
            <li> It only took me a few shaves to become somewhat proficient in it.</li>
            <li> I spent months adjusting to ( and almost giving up on) wet shaving.</li>
            <li> burn no matter how carefully I shaved.</li>
            <li> As a newbie de wet shaver I bought these blades on amazon as they were the cheapest on this site.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel is poor quality as evidenced by the rust marks on the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a fairly rough beard and when I got done I had a close shave with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> I will give this a 5 star review because the product performed exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> However, I could never really get that BBS shave with a Derby</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack in order to try out a few different types.</li>
            <li> Blade life is minimal.</li>
            <li> Two shaves tops for me as the blades fails to keep a good cutting edge because multiple passes are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Each blade lasts me about five shaves before they drag at all.</li>
            <li> Also, with the value you get for price, if you get a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; blade you really do not care, since each blades is costing you somewhere in the 25 cents range.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending too much money on cartridges that lasted only a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I have friends who don&#x27;t spent time with beard prep</li>
            <li> These blades did not work for me way to much drag and pull.</li>
            <li> Basically this is a year&#x27;s supply of blades for me, at a few dollars total.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few blades</li>
            <li> My beard is fairly rough and I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> Lifetime wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Some gave me a rough pull from the start.</li>
            <li> No cut skin, and no skin irritation, but the trade off is not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> but maybe thats just my wet shave technique changing from shave to shave..</li>
            <li> I have been a wet shave(r) for years</li>
            <li> careful</li>
            <li> They give a close shave with minimal razor burn.  </li>
            <li> They are so inexpensive, that this is not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Roughly 1 in 5 blades would be noticeably duller, unusable even.  </li>
            <li> so I try to be careful with what I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through them faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> No razor burn but not a very close shave either.</li>
            <li> If you have thin facial hair or sensitive skin these will work.</li>
            <li> My friend said that this did not provide enough sternness on his thick facial hair and he recommended Astra platinum.</li>
            <li> It seemed as if those Mach 3&#x27;s were getting less sharp and more expensive!</li>
            <li> But in my experience, they seem less sharp initially than other blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are not less aggressive, they are simply dull.</li>
            <li> I hoped it was just one pack that had a bad run on the production line, but after using blades out of a couple other packs it didnt get any better.</li>
            <li> We bought him a sampler pack of blades among other things and he took a few months to hone his technique and learn the different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically do not grow a thick beard</li>
            <li> Even the cut out slot in the center are identical to each other.</li>
            <li> I received a small package of Derby blades with a double-edged razor purchase not long ago.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely sharp, but even if you don&#x27;t cut yourself, the pass is rough and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> The Shark blades seemed to last at least twice that long.</li>
            <li> The feathers are slightly sharper and possibly shave a little closer.  </li>
            <li> This pack of 100 will last me a VERY long time and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> So tired of Gillette&#x27;s HIGH PRICES</li>
            <li> So it shaved decently on my right cheek with the grain, when I switched over to my left cheek after shaving my neck it was painfully pulling my hair, so I thought my lather was dry and reapplied.</li>
            <li> They are a little less sharp than Feather blades but are sharp enough.</li>
            <li> and they barely lasted a week before they were dull and causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> the Derby is not the sharpest blade, but the shave is so much smoother and less irritating</li>
            <li> I can only say that for my beard and skin, the Derby gives me a shave as close as anything I&#x27;ve gotten with with other blades, and it does so with very, very little irritation.</li>
            <li> but my use of Persona, Feather, and other brands known for being super sharp only resulted in lots of painful razor</li>
            <li> No cuts and as sharp as any of the razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> He loves them, but the had to get used to them because they are so so sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other brands, for example (Feather).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that are over a $1.00 a blade</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother experimenting with other brands</li>
            <li> The other bonus of the Derby blade is the value.</li>
            <li> They are sharp...</li>
            <li> NO MORE RED BUMPS FOR THIS GUY</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return them due to them being in the health product category.  </li>
            <li> Feathers, as it turned out, were sharp, but would catch against the thicker spokes of hair.</li>
            <li> Every blade is sharp.</li>
            <li> These are as sharp as I can imagine anything being</li>
            <li> a must purchase blades are always Dimond sharp</li>
            <li> They last a few shaves, shave close, and are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I have fewer nicks, cuts using these maybe because they are not as sharp.</li>
            <li> Although the Feathers are extremely sharp, I always manage to mangle my face with them.</li>
            <li> but &amp;#34;even if&amp;#34; these are still plenty sharp and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> theyre sharp.</li>
            <li> i have gotten when compared to other blades.</li>
            <li> also usually shave my head, but I don&#x27;t recommend a double edged razor for that.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this is the case for other blades as well.</li>
            <li> though it was my technique, or just how DE shaving is, but I tried some other blades from the drugstore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no connoisseur, so perhaps there are minute differences that other people notice that I have</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and as sharp as you could want them to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> But they are not as sharp as Derby&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades aren&#x27;t shockingly sharp, but they work for shaving my beard and head.</li>
            <li> I think maybe these are not quite as sharp as Feathers</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a goatee and shave every other day.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my neck, leaving the facial area alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The blades are numbered 1 and 2 on one side and 3 and 4 on the other side&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The blades are as sharp as any other blades I&#x27;ve ever bought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found they are not as sharp as &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, but not too aggressive.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to my technique though.</li>
            <li> These blades are so sharp I didn&#x27;t feel it when I nicked myself.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and plentiful.</li>
            <li> However the Feather blades that came with it are too sharp for me,many nicks.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the 95 blades of these I still have left...</li>
            <li> They are sharp but not so sharp that they take a layer of skin with them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know whether this was due to a non close shave or my hair is just growing faster now.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t nick as much as other blades, and they don&#x27;t leave razor burn.</li>
            <li> Medium sharp blades.</li>
            <li> it would be that they are almost too sharp.</li>
            <li> Keeps a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than Derby.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> It is still cheaper than other method of shaving.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to other shavers.  </li>
            <li> I still have other blades from my starter pack that I plan to try.  </li>
            <li> These blades are not as sharp as others and are easier on my face.</li>
            <li> I had to flip to the other side to keep my skin intact.</li>
            <li> so I bought some other brands based on recommendations.  </li>
            <li> I used it and none of it is sharp.</li>
            <li> but I now am a believer in those other reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are not feather blades (those are ninja sword sharp).</li>
            <li> While there are other blades out there</li>
            <li> sharp, inexpensive, a 2 year supply</li>
            <li> The Derby is not as sharp as others but may suite others needs.</li>
            <li> because I shave every other day or so.</li>
            <li> So a pack of 100 will last me a year since I usually don&#x27;t shave on weekends.</li>
            <li> your just getting into wet shaving, or are looking for an alternative to mainstream multi-blade systems, these are where you need to start!</li>
            <li> I have had a little experience with a few other blades such as Wilkinson&#x27;s, Gillette and Personna.</li>
            <li> Very sharp so be careful</li>
            <li> then one half razor to finish the center.</li>
            <li> get minimal nicks with this, it shaves well and has less irritation than some of the others.</li>
            <li> Some blades, or half the blade, seemed a little dull and pulled slightly after the second or third shave.</li>
            <li> beard isn&#x27;t real thick, but the whiskers are wiry and hard to cut plus I have soft, pliable, sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it will take me a long time to get through all of these blades, so I&#x27;m wishing I hadn&#x27;t bought such a big box.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and leave less razor burn than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I gave these razors an extra star, because you can usually buy a pack of 100 for less than $10.</li>
            <li> As compared to other blades that I have tried, they are extremely dull and I could only get one shave out of the blade without the blade grabbing my hair.</li>
            <li> 90% of the blades are incredibly sharp and will last me at least 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- May not be sharp enough for those with a thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, almost too sharp.</li>
            <li> but they are plenty sharp for me and not even half the cost.</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as Feather brand but less cuts and bandaids.  </li>
            <li> The blades are dull and require a lot of work to get an even moderately close shave.</li>
            <li> Three shaves from the same blade that appeared dull when used in the Shaving Factory safety</li>
            <li> is that they tend to dull around the 3rd shave on.</li>
            <li> I think a blade should last for at least a week</li>
            <li> I get an average of 7 shaves off of each blade.</li>
            <li> average</li>
            <li> This amount of blades will last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> My husband will not have to buy razors for the next year at least.  </li>
            <li> A 100 pack will last for at least a year in my hands.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend them to at least try.</li>
            <li> This is an average blade.</li>
            <li> Just average</li>
            <li> This 100 count has got me covered for the next 4 to 6 years at least depending on how often I shave or change the blades.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is the pack does not have a used blade slot but for the price I am not complaining.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is rather thick, and the Derby&#x27;s had no problem shearing through them.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> These give me a good shave and the cost savings is insane.</li>
            <li> If your beard is thick it is possible.  </li>
            <li> if you have a thick beard, consider a different blade or buy a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> I got the 100 count and use one blade for around 10 shaves( my facial hair is not as thick as others)</li>
            <li> The 100 Count box will last me neatly a year plus shaving with a Safety Razor is a slow relaxing exercise.  </li>
            <li> They seem to bog down in longer whiskers...</li>
            <li> I STEPPED DOWN TO DERBYS</li>
            <li> It comes down about 10 cents per piece</li>
            <li> I then stepped down to try the Derby.  </li>
            <li> These blades are plenty sharp for me!</li>
            <li> They stay sharp and you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out!</li>
            <li> Very sharp....</li>
            <li> I saw some reviewers stating that a few other brands may be sharper, I doubt that</li>
            <li> There very sharp too.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades hold a sharp edge for a week for me, but I only shave every other day, and have a thin beard.</li>
            <li> So in essence they aren&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I tried some Feather and they were very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The Derby blades pulled a lot and for some reason had a lot of trouble with nicks in the neck area where I didn&#x27;t with the other blades I was trying, they just didn&#x27;t seem very sharp.  </li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly a few of complaints I&#x27;ve heard about these are that they aren&#x27;t as sharp as X or Y.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, use caution when using.</li>
            <li> I use a safety razor and I have used a single blade for at least 2 weeks and it is still sharp.</li>
            <li> But I could&#x27;nt care less</li>
            <li> The reviews of Derby blades about being a less aggressive blade which with the razor burn</li>
            <li> Additionally, they would knick any bumps on my face and cause slight bleeding.</li>
            <li> I have been DE shaving for about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> I recently rediscovered double edge razors, trying to save money over the multi-blade cartridges that have become too expensive.</li>
            <li> blade costs about a dime; for me, that&#x27;s less than one cent per shave.</li>
            <li> shaves per blade at 100 blades is about 5 and half years of shaving.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half of them.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m less prone to cuts anyway.  </li>
            <li> Some do it because of less razor burn.  </li>
            <li> And for less than 8 cents .. You can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> Maybe I was shipped an entire box of reject blades, for I&#x27;m not quite sure how they can all be so terrible when the rest of the reviews here are favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a year and half.  </li>
            <li> towards the end of a blades life i switch to with the grain shaving for less irritation.  </li>
            <li> The blades are slightly thicker than tissue paper.</li>
            <li> replacing the Mach 3 type that I had used previously.</li>
            <li> I will typically change the blade out weekly</li>
            <li> What else can one ask for less than $10.00?</li>
            <li> shall I say, less than a manageable grain direction need.</li>
            <li> I typically use one a week</li>
            <li> 2 shaves per blade, 100 blades, 200 shaves, half a cent per shave.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades where just too expensive to switch out on a daily basis, but prolong periods of using the same stainless-steel blade can still develop bacteria which can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> but so are Astra which are now my blade of choice  and cost less than $10 on Amazon for 100 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in fact for alot less money than you could ever expect.  </li>
            <li> but I probably should have stopped after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> At less than 10 cents a blade</li>
            <li> but once you get your technique down, you might want to go with something a little sharper.  </li>
            <li> AND STILL HAVE A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF THE BOX TO GO THROUGH.</li>
            <li> but one complaint and its minor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one of these blades so far, so I could have gotten a bad blade, and while they were sharp, they just didn&#x27;t trim well at all.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these someone at random after acquiring a new razor that would accommodate them.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with these blades, I can may be shave one cheek if I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li> After shaving I rinse blade and put a little mineral oil and stropp edges with my finger tips.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that I did not get nicked like I have in the past with other brands of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the 4th shave, i felt a little tugging and pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks now and they produce a close shave with little or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades cut just as well if not better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used and they seem to hold their edge longer to me (not that it matters when they&#x27;re so cheap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use care on day one of if you are not familiar with them.</li>
            <li> Those little plastic things</li>
            <li> They probably could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> If you use a double blade, you know that some brands are near impossible to get out of their packaging without slicing your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Each blade lasts several shaves, and each side is numbered allowing up to four different edges for cutting (two on each side if you flip the blade over in the razor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a DE for a few months now</li>
            <li> and you can use they for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Have used these for a few days now and seem to be working well for him.  </li>
            <li> One blade lasts quite a few shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are feeling confused by the constant chatter in reviews about the comparisons of blade sharpness between brands or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard either.</li>
            <li> I tried these because I was tired of buying Mach3 cartridges at about $25 a pack, for an unenjoyable daily face-scraping.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few non-Russian blades that work well for me.</li>
            <li> Used for a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> to an antique store or go online and without too much trouble you can find gizmos which claim to re-sharpen your razor blade.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium beard, not too heavy</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and find I can get</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has a heavy beard like me that swears by this brand, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor a few months ago</li>
            <li> I bought 100 Derby blades on Amazon after trying a few in my Feather razor.</li>
            <li> aka one size does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard or remotely thicker beard these are not for your.  </li>
            <li> Does tug after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I heat all this up while making coffee, so no time wasted.</li>
            <li> derby is my everyday and feather</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but it did prevent a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades!</li>
            <li> I had a foray using feathers and they cut less of my hair while still irritating my skin a bit, which is strange considering their reputation for sharpness.</li>
            <li> Why pay $28 for a small pack of cartridge blades when you can get 100 blades for half the cost?  </li>
            <li> Some blades have a reputation for being too dull or even overly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers claim the blades are sharp, others report theirs being dull.</li>
            <li> A complaint accusing a blade for being too sharp is an oxymoron to me, like a car tire is too perfectly round.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of blades for the money but the quality (in the pack I received at least) is not consistent.</li>
            <li> These blades are ever so slightly wider than the blades I&#x27;ve used in the past, so they leave a pointlessly small gap between the blade edge and the safety razor &amp;#34;cage&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You can seriously use these blades one time and throw it away, while still shaving daily, and still save money from the ridiculous cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to reccomend a DE blade to someone else as its such a personal decision.</li>
            <li> At fist I didn&#x27;t even want to try the Derby blades because of all the reviews I read in the past of how dull they are compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The first shave isn&#x27;t so bad, but that&#x27;s when it ends.</li>
            <li> Have used these blades for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> It helps you slow down and pay attention to what you are doing while shaving, but it&#x27;s the beauty of using badger &amp; blade to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seem to get dull and start pulling half way through my face.  </li>
            <li> Less than a dime per  blade,  blade lasts at least 7 days.  </li>
            <li> Bonded Blades cost  at least a couple of dollars each, the Derby Blades are less than a penny each.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box has a little dispenser too!</li>
            <li> If I have done the calculations correctly, that comes down to approximately 200 sharp edges per box!</li>
            <li> Compared to other blades,this blades from Turkey is not good.</li>
            <li> (In case you didn&#x27;t know, the back of the Derby Box has a slot for used razors so you don&#x27;t have to throw a dangerous, sharp blade in the trash)</li>
            <li> I felt a lot of tugging and very little hair removal.</li>
            <li> There are some sharper blades on the market - but it is hard to beat theses blades for their combination of sharpness, durability, shaver friendliness (few nicks) and price.</li>
            <li> I dislike handling the electronic shavers, as the blades go bad in a year and it costs as much as another shaver to get them replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going back to expensive razors again.</li>
            <li> I both cut myself and missed at least a few spots.  </li>
            <li> Sharper is not better for everyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle the sharper stuff, but usually after one shave these derbys fall apart.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m usually shaving a thicker beard.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, they feel like they have small burrs on them, because even when I&#x27;m really careful these things end up giving me cuts, which almost never happens with higher-quality blades.</li>
            <li> I shave once a week usually</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but what I have, has thick hairs.</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say I hear this all the time about what brands to buy and usually you hear the name feather.  </li>
            <li> Before shaving with expensive Mach 3 razors which would leave my face red and burned !</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for the past 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> I figured they would be basic mediocre blades that I could use when I was just needing a touch up shave.</li>
            <li> Individually the blades are floppy and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t terrible, they&#x27;ll get the job done, but with a lot more strokes needed and irritation after.  </li>
            <li> Hubby uses a regular razor, and we&#x27;ve had some issues with lousy blades.</li>
            <li> I like the small 5 count packs</li>
            <li> and I usually use it for two days.</li>
            <li> and I have a small collection of them.</li>
            <li> On my face, I can usually get 2 shaves out of one blade (1 shave being with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the consistency Derby has when producing these blades.</li>
            <li> I get about a week out of a Derby blade and usually change it just because it seems like it&#x27;s been a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These did an alright job in the Weishi (my usual razor).</li>
            <li> Although not the sharpest blades I have tried in my short limited experience, it is not at all bad.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not super thick but definitely not super thin either.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard, but one pass with this razor blade</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but other blades would either cut my face or snag on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Blades are thin, well coated and sharp.</li>
            <li> For guys who know what they are doing, thin and sharp are just what we are looking for.</li>
            <li> Sharp thin blades.</li>
            <li> I still like using my double edged razor, but blades are extremely hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> I only get a couple of shaves out of each of these, but even if you only use a blade once, it&#x27;s still a substantial savings over the over-hyped, over-priced crap that&#x27;s advertised on television</li>
            <li> Not a very good blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 20 brands in the past 5 years and dollar for dollar these Derby blades are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I used them in is not suitable for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stocked up for the next few years at a sickening low price!!!!</li>
            <li> Dull out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Too dull for my beard.</li>
            <li> and I notice the blade either beginning to rust or dull to the point that it&#x27;s unusable for me.</li>
            <li> The Merkors are dull and never give me a quality shave.</li>
            <li> sometimes hard to find blades</li>
            <li> I see no reason to pinch the pennies that hard.  </li>
            <li> matter how often I change the blade, it seems dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend keeping a glass or hard plastic container in your drawer and throwing them in there.  </li>
            <li> , take off pieces of skin, and are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are hard to find these days, so a big&lt;br /&gt;supply</li>
            <li> Absolutely dull.</li>
            <li> I shave Mon-Fri and the blade doesn&#x27;t feel dull to me until about shave 8, 9, or 10.</li>
            <li> I get maybe two shaves with each blade before they get too dull to use again.</li>
            <li> I find that about 1 in 5 blades is dull either on both edges or a least one to the point that you can&#x27;t shave with it</li>
            <li> but, LaserShip delivered my package 3 days late, even tho</li>
            <li> and they do the job of cutting my facial hair just as well as any blade out there.</li>
            <li> me, however, these blades provide the smoothest shave with the least amount of irritation.</li>
            <li> I get at least 4 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> I do not regret my decision in the least.</li>
            <li> i had one complaint (and i don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using every blade at least 3 times with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Whether I had 2 days growth or shaved daily, the blade was not gliding and cutting...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need to buy blades again for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that thick of a beard.  </li>
            <li> so someone with thick, wiry whiskers probably would benefit from the sharper brands.</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t even that thick.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and change the blade about once a month.  </li>
            <li> I have a relatively thick beard and change the blade about once every 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to thick beard growth</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard this probably isn&#x27;t going to suit you.  </li>
            <li> Very dull out of the box, poor quality blade alignment on about 1 of 5 blades, never have this problem with other blades.</li>
            <li> Though if I had to rank blades I would say it is sharper than Sharks, but not quite as sharp as the German Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li> However, if you are not skilled at shaving, they can cut you to ribbons because they are very thin and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend it to anyone who needs a clean shave and suffers from ugly razor bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great savings - no more plastic disposable razors going in the landfill for me!</li>
            <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s supposed to mean.</li>
            <li> Now go look at the price of just 6 Mach 3 blades or some other lousy setup.</li>
            <li> No more overpriced disposable razors for us!</li>
            <li> No more Shark razors for this girl!</li>
            <li> Occasionally he gets a bad blade though that must have a small nick or flaw in it that cuts up his skin</li>
            <li> goodbye gillette high price crap.</li>
            <li> I figured my wife would give me grief over a new &amp;#34;hobby&amp;#34; but she loves the economy and the fact that these shave me closer than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than the disposable razors out there.</li>
            <li> The price for razors in the drugstore are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> (seriously, I could go six passes and still be scratchy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i seriously think i have 4-5 years of blades though.</li>
            <li> Seriously I switched to the safety blade razor over a year ago, from the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> They are meant for the casual shaver who probably shaves every 4-5 days or less; which is what i fall under.</li>
            <li> was a little nervous about getting into DE shaving because everyone with a DE shaver seems to use a fancy brush and expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard with very thick hair</li>
            <li> They last on me about 8-10 shaves before going bad.</li>
            <li> Doing so will not only give you a bad shave</li>
            <li> (Not wise, i know).</li>
            <li> They freaking suck though, just ask Shave Busta or any other major youtube shaver, these blades were so awful</li>
            <li> These should at least be tried!  </li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t get the tough hairs on my neck without 10-15 strokes.</li>
            <li> My beard is too tough for these blades.  </li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 they start to lose that sharpness (I have tough hair).</li>
            <li> , my hairs are very thick, and I always want a blade that will stand up to my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and it takes approximately one razor to do each side of my face and</li>
            <li> Dull blades providing an uncomfortable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately derby blades are a bit too dull for my face, but that is a subjective issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frankly, I believe cuts and nicks are a result of poor technique and not the blades.</li>
            <li> Either these blades are poorly made or the Edwin jagger razor</li>
            <li> not great...</li>
            <li> Leads me to believe that there is poor quality control by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced the phenomenon of a blade being &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that to be the secret.  </li>
            <li> It can be irritating if you do not know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of having razors burns AND spending 30 a month to gillette.</li>
            <li> I can get about 1 shave off of it before it takes on the shaving qualities of a broken bottle.</li>
            <li> What works well for one person may work poorly for another.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying over $2.50 for a blade for my Gillette Mach 3 razor every week so switched to a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Poor.</li>
            <li> Used Shave Secret oil with all blades tested.</li>
            <li> after that they are like \\&quot;broken bottle\\&quot; on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had to follow behind with my fusion razor.</li>
            <li> no raised taxes, no constant buying, if you don&#x27;t shave with these your a moron...</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t make it a poor blade, it makes it a poor blade FOR YOU.  </li>
            <li> I now find myself going through two or three blades IN ONE MORNING, before finding one that wasn&#x27;t either scraping my face or stamped so poorly it wouldn&#x27;t sit correctly in my razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the least bit guilty changing the blade for every shave.  </li>
            <li> To avoid skin irritation I must draw the razor somewhat slowly, feeling the blade smoothly cutting the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> But I recently bought the 100 pack from this site, and I was shocked and disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> preferred over the multiblade expensive alternatives...</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with that?</li>
            <li> Sad to say</li>
            <li> For this price, you cant fail by trying them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just blades, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> . was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong about that.</li>
            <li> I dont think ill ever run out again.</li>
            <li> ever!&lt;br /&gt;I was so sad when I ran out of these blades from the sample pack.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong for a 100 at this price.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to purchase expensive 5-blade razor replacements.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong try them</li>
            <li> For the price I paid you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty throwing them away.  </li>
            <li> which makes my coworkers uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> am sorry I bought the 100 box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> I guess that means I won&#x27;t be angry</li>
            <li> Really not Impressed with the results of the Derby.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s marketing budget on creating fake reviews.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with these for the price.  </li>
            <li> Very thin blade, almost paper like.</li>
            <li> These blades are dull and don&#x27;t work well and now have a bunch of worthless blades.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using an Edwin Jagger DE safety razor for a couple of years due to the outrageous cost of throw-away razors.  </li>
            <li> too dull!!!</li>
            <li> again derby too dull!!!</li>
            <li> I like that the cutting surfaces are numbered.</li>
            <li> I bleed like crazy from these blades.</li>
            <li> AT YOUR RAZOR, GET MAD AT THE BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I do not see anything wrong with them, so I think they deserve 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot go wrong, 100 blades!</li>
            <li> The Worst hardly..</li>
            <li> had very expensive razors, that cut me and turned my face on fire.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I was going to give it a bad review until I saw the price.  </li>
            <li> for the price these blades arent bad...</li>
            <li> After shaving for 24 years, I&#x27;ve never had razor burn so bad, would not recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I wont be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was slightly disappointed that my package did NOT come with the Arko soap.  </li>
            <li> They provide me the closest shave without getting dangerously close to shaving my face off!</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> Throw away your stupid plastic Gillette and buy these.</li>
            <li> I do however like not spending a stupid amount of money on shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> I am returning 7 out of the 10 packs, they are worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate the turks</li>
            <li> If you are giving this blade a 1 star review because it didn&#x27;t give you the shave you wanted stop being an idiot.  </li>
            <li> I use the bics disposables as the worst alternative, or mach 3 blades before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are terrible!</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely terrible.  </li>
            <li> insanely cheap!,great shave!</li>
            <li> I had the worst razor burn.</li>
            <li> In fact, they were terrible.</li>
            <li> These are AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> Among all of the DE blades that I have used the Derby blades are the worst.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the worst blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are the worst blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> So I used to use those multi-blade razors until they got insanely over priced.</li>
            <li> that I have tried featherblades and crystal blades, I think these are terrible.</li>
            <li> I had a miserable shave.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> By far the best blade!</li>
            <li> Great value!  These razors work fantastic on my face.  No cuts and as sharp as any of the razors I have used.  Frankly, I believe cuts and nicks are a result of poor technique and not the blades.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a blade.  great quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Great sharp blades at a great price. Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> Ok, but not in the top three.</li>
            <li> From what i can tell as a beginner shaver these do the job well and i have but one complaint and its minor. After two or three uses they start to rust and i cant use them after that i do keep them dry and in a dry closet but it must just be because i live in michigan.</li>
            <li> Have been trying different blades for years.  The key with these babies is to change the blades every day (which I certainly don&#x27;t mind doing for the price!).  Great blade.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra is working very well in my Merkur 38D. I&#x27;m getting a smooth shave without the cuts and scrapes that I get from Dorco ST301s and Shark blades. I&#x27;ve been using a DE for a few months now and I&#x27;m still trying out new blades. I&#x27;ll see if these blades work as well in my Parker 99R next.</li>
            <li> Works great at an awesome price. Gives a much better shave than the disposable razors I have used for decades....I will never go back to disposables again.</li>
            <li> Does what they are supposed to do. A bunch in a cheap package. I&#x27;m not going back to expensive razors again.</li>
            <li> Picked these as a result of prior reviews  Shave is amazing  will continue to use these not only for quality but for the great price</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who wanted to wet shave. He loves them, but the had to get used to them because they are so so sharp.</li>
            <li> I ordered these someone at random after acquiring a new razor that would accommodate them. They&#x27;re good blades. What I don&#x27;t like is having to unwrap each of them one at a time with the opportunity of slicing myself to shreds in the process. When I remember from my youth many years ago is sliding them out of the container one by one into the razor. What happened to those?</li>
            <li> Either these blades are poorly made or the Edwin jagger razor I used them in is not suitable for them. I have experienced the worst shave since I switched to the new blades and razor</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp and give a very smooth, close shave. Taking into account the low price, I would highly recommend these razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave that often, but like a wet shave every now and then.  For the price and the amount of blades included, this was a pretty good deal.  Even avid shavers should have a pretty good run with this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all; Astra, Feather, Mercur, etc. Derby is hands down my favorite blade. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to cut yourself, but gets that nice close shave that you&#x27;d expect from a safety razor. If you want the sharpest blade around, go with the Feather. If you want the best all around blade go with the Derby.</li>
            <li> These blades are fair for the first shave but don&#x27;t make it much past the third and I don&#x27;t have that thick of a beard.  I was happy to get 100 of them because double-edged blades aren&#x27;t that easy to find in stores anymore but now I feel like I&#x27;m stuck with an inferior product.  I think a blade should last for at least a week and these really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I may be a hoarder (I have three of these packages).  One never knows when something like this can be discontinued. I really enjoy the pragmatic and ritualistic aspects of wet-shaving.  I find these blades to be just right with longevity and shaving experience.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other brands, for example (Feather).  What I realized, was that sharper does not equate to a better shave.  I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but other blades would either cut my face or snag on my beard.  This brand works and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works perfectly with the shaver.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Started using an Old Timer razor and after checking out reviews on Amazon, I went with these. I love them! I have very sensitive skin And these have been a blessing. No razor bumps anymore</li>
            <li> I barely have any facial hair, just a little moustache fuzz and a bit under the chin.  I use the bics disposables as the worst alternative, or mach 3 blades before.  Each blade would last me a few weeks, 3-4 weeks probably.  I bought an old fashioned handle and put these blades in.  Each blade lasts me as long as any bic razor.  So, for 10 cents a blade compared to 1.50 for a mach 3, I&#x27;d choose these.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades, very sharp, be careful / they are great!</li>
            <li> Never shaved with a safety razor before so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  These work fine though they dull after 4-5 shaves.  But for the price, I can buy more.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Recommend changing after every shave.</li>
            <li> Dull out of the box.  First shave was so uncomfortable I threw the entire box away.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than the disposable razors out there. My husband really likes it once he passed the learning curve of this type of razor. Only negative comment on these blades is that there have been several in the box that have had absolutely no edge to the blade at all and had to be thrown away. Guess company needs a QC.</li>
            <li> A very good reasonably priced product, which allows me to change blades about once a week for $.50! The 200 count is a little better buy. I&#x27;ve used other brands that are over a $1.00 a blade a can&#x27;t tell much difference !! Would recommend and will keep buying !!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, thanks!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Only used one blade.</li>
            <li> These Derby blades are a very good blade at a great price. These are my \\&quot;go to \\&quot; blades --- the standard to which I hold other blades up to in comparison. Wet shavers new to double edge shaving should use these blades a their starter blade. There are some sharper blades on the market - but it is hard to beat theses blades for their combination of sharpness, durability, shaver friendliness (few nicks) and price. You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These razors work great, good quality and excellent price! This comes with little 5 razor plastic cases with a total of 100 razors.You can put the old used razors in the bottom of the little razor case too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The box has a little dispenser too!</li>
            <li> Great razors! Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I get 5 shaves out of one blade. Great</li>
            <li> Too dull for my beard. Probably work great for someone with a light beard.</li>
            <li> good, cheap close shave ..preferred over the multiblade expensive alternatives... my new choice of razor blade/ shaving system..i can get two or three shaves out of each blade which equates to two to three hundred shaves for less than ten bucks .. im good with that ..</li>
            <li> Great blades. Great value.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re literally amazing. I upgraded from disposable Gillette blades to this with an Edwin jagger razor. These blades are stunningly sharp and give a smooth shave. Even if they cut you it won&#x27;t hurt, which is either Good or bad haha. But I must say I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience because I am only 16 so I don&#x27;t know if you should trust my review or not. But I could&#x27;nt care less</li>
            <li> Not my favorite blades.  Used shark blades before with better success.</li>
            <li> I use a new blade every Monday morning.  awesome concept .08/blade....................</li>
            <li> item was as described and was shipped promptly</li>
            <li> Great value and great price. 100 blades for $10. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Good blades. Only reason for 4 stars is they dull a little fast to me.</li>
            <li> good blades--I love i</li>
            <li> The blades are good however not as sharp as I am looking for. Also they only last 2 to 3 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well for me.  They are very smooth, without nicks or cuts... and long lasting.  Too be honest, they remind me of Merkur blades (which also work very well on my beard).</li>
            <li> Cheapest blade available: 100 blades for $7.50. Not the best blade, but if you can use them they&#x27;re a winner.</li>
            <li> Love these blades. I use them with my Edwin Jagger DE89bl (Which is freaking awesome.) I really like the shave they provide and will stick with these blades for the foreseeable future. The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves the skin VERY smooth after a 2 pass. Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I get an average of 7 shaves off of each blade. They are super affordable to use.</li>
            <li> Not a very good blade. Too dull for me and leaves too many nicks. I need good sharp blades that are not going to irritate. This one does not accomplish that.</li>
            <li> Had my first DE shave today using these blades in a Jagger 89 razor.  Cannot imagine a reason to use another blade on my face.  Great shave, no  nick or burn and great price.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s face and beard is different, so your results may vary, but these are sure worth a try.  I am feeling like these are giving me a shave of about the same quality as a straight razor shave for me.</li>
            <li> As advertised great price.</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price. They don&#x27;t last as long as murkur razors but at this price you can afford to use a fresh one for each shave.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPOINTED, WITH ANYTHING THEN THIS</li>
            <li> Great value for money blades. High quality product which stays sharp. How can you beat almost two years supply of blades for $10??</li>
            <li> I bought this brand before via Amazon and the previous purchase was far superior. I only get a couple of shaves out of each of these, but even if you only use a blade once, it&#x27;s still a substantial savings over the over-hyped, over-priced crap that&#x27;s advertised on television (there&#x27;s a reason they can afford all of that advertising). Besides, how cool is it to be able to say you shave &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I have heard that these tend to be on the mild sharpness scale where as Feather blades are scary sharp.  I found these blades produced a perfect shave time and time again.</li>
            <li> I have been using derby extras for 2+ years. I like they alot. They shave very close and you can use they for a few shaves. I typically don&#x27;t use them for more than 2 shaves, but I have very thick stubble and very soft skin that cuts easy, so you may get more use than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is forgiving enough that you won&#x27;t cut yourself if you press a little too hard, but is still sharp enough to give you a very nice tug free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the price it great. I can get enough razors to last me 2 years for $20-$30 and as I stated above I am constantly changing them to get a very sharp shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good shave that is durable and tug free for a great price.</li>
            <li> Love these blades and the savings! 10 bucks for 100 blades compared to 200 bucks for cartridges per year. These blades will last me 2 years!</li>
            <li> Why pay $28 for a small pack of cartridge blades when you can get 100 blades for half the cost?  Great blades that last me about 3 weeks each.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 20 brands in the past 5 years and dollar for dollar these Derby blades are hard to beat. They offer a consistent product that hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> got these for his new razor to keep him well shaved</li>
            <li> Cause irritation and dulls quickly</li>
            <li> At 56 years old, and shaving for 40 years I learned that DO NOT GET&lt;br /&gt;MAD AT YOUR RAZOR, GET MAD AT THE BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;What am I talking about?&lt;br /&gt;I had very expensive razors, that cut me and turned my face on fire.&lt;br /&gt;Well, as it turned out the blade was a Feather.&lt;br /&gt;Feather, yellow, is very very very sharp...too darn sharp.&lt;br /&gt;So, I turned to Derby and it was like a new dawn.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, 99% less knicks and cuts and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;so...buy Derby, love shaving</li>
            <li> This is the brand that came with my razor and they work fine, so I didn&#x27;t bother experimenting with other brands but I hear that is what most people end up doing.  They shave close and I&#x27;ve never gotten a nick on my face (have to be much more careful when I shave my head!).</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, for a very good price</li>
            <li> I just received this item, so for now I just want to provide some images.</li>
            <li> This is a great blade. It is sharp enough to get a very close shave, but not so sharp that you cut yourself all the time. Great for those that are new to safety razors, like me. Sometimes I have to lather up for a second pass, but that&#x27;s not a problem! I highly recommend Derby!</li>
            <li> Ok, after all the hype I&#x27;ve read about the exotic expensive blades, I bought a major sampling to see what I had been missing. My razor is an E. Jagger 89dbl and it came with a pack of Derby blades which I found to be excellent. Never the less, I tried the others just to be sure and the blade that I keep going back to is the Derby. I have a coarse heavy beard that requires daily shaving and after even several days of neglect, the Derby&#x27;s cut right through it smoothly with no difficulties or drag. Sure, some of the other blades I tried seemed sharper but that was of no benefit and the only time I have ever had a nick/cut from shaving was from those blades. The Derby&#x27;s on the other hand are plenty sharp and glide across my face leaving a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation at all. The other bonus of the Derby blade is the value. I now get 100 blades for just a little more than I used to pay for 10 blades.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what you&#x27;d expect razor blades to do. While they are slightly flimsy, once you put it in your safety razor it will not be evident anymore.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to be fine.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and these seemed to get high reviews for the price.  Rest assured that even on the maiden voyage, still using canned shaving cream, these produced a comparable shave to my Mach 3.  Slightly more cuts, but the irritation was actually quite a bit lower.  I expect to improve with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was slightly disappointed that my package did NOT come with the Arko soap.  I was sort of banking on it to start shaving with a decent soap, and had to rely on my shaving cream.  Not a huge deal, but it did prevent a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I use these, feathers, and wilkinson swords and I definitely notice a bit more tug and pull with these blades. I use these mostly for light shaves and for $10 for a 100ct you can use a new one every shave and never have to listen to your wallet cringe.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these ohhhh about a lifetime ago. I first started using them with a safety razor 3 years ago. Then I started breaking them in half and using them with a straight razor. I&#x27;ve been enjoying clean and inexpensive shaves for years off that first box, and FINALLY have had to replace the box. One of these days I will be buying a strop, but until then these are as frugal as its gonna get. I&#x27;m a FAN.</li>
            <li> chose this rating as i used the first blade.. shave was acceptable.. not great... not bad.. i cleaned the blade, removed it and replaced in the shaver.. shaved the second time with it.. and obtained razor rash.  So use this blade one time. throw it away. and get a new one for the next shave.</li>
            <li> I think this pack is gonna last me the next 5 years. Derby blades work great. I use it with an Edwin Jagger safety razor.</li>
            <li> Have used these for a few days now and seem to be working well for him.  Says they give him a close shave, just what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have the dreaded combination of ultra sensitive skin and stubble with the consistency of steel wool. These blades are sharp enough to provide me with the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever achieved while at the same time being forgiving enough to perform multiple passes and touch ups with very little irritation. Not to mention the price. Ten bucks for 100 blades. How can you go wrong with that? Double edge blades work differently for everyone so you&#x27;re experience may be different than mine, so I recommend purchasing a sampler pack if you are new to double edge shaving. I&#x27;m a Derby man for life.</li>
            <li> They are sharp... nothing really to complain about.</li>
            <li> Pretty sharp. You can use each blade for 2 shaves. There are about 100 blades. So the pack will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow, these blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Short of a cut-throat razor, I&#x27;ve never had this clean a shave before.  And I&#x27;m getting 7-8 shaving days out of the blades instead of 4-5 with others.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like? They&#x27;re so affordable and yet give you a way more pleasant (and frankly, closer) shave than cartridges. Throw away your stupid plastic Gillette and buy these.</li>
            <li> Good quality blades. They provide a great shave and last much longer than I expected! Very impressed for how little they cost.</li>
            <li> Have used the Derby for daily shaving for quite some time.  Am very happy with the product; the shave is not quite as close as the Feather blades, but at age 83 the nicks and cuts were increasing.  It also appeared to me that the quality of Feather may not be the same. Recommend the Derby blades for every day, safe, shaving;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to De razor shaving. These blades work well and I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Great blades, I haven&#x27;t had to buy new ones for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> My hubby uses these for his daily shave routine. They work great for him and are the most affordable option we have come across. The price for razors in the drugstore are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, but not excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality and longevity both fair.&lt;br /&gt;Nick, and cuts; lasts about 3 shaves before need to discard.&lt;br /&gt;Basis of comparison is FEATHER BRAND blades.</li>
            <li> Great price, but the blades weren&#x27;t very sharp. I had to throw some away.</li>
            <li> They are not to sharp and the individual blades last long enough to make this a value that is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and these are the just the right amount of sharp for my sensitive skin. I shave every other day and install a new blade every Monday morning no matter what so its easy to keep track. Yes- a 2 year supply of blades for $10!!! Eat My A** Mach3&#x27;s that chew up my neck! Merkur DE razor, Geo F Trumper Coconut shaving cream, then Proraso pre/post shave cream to finish it up. NO MORE RED BUMPS FOR THIS GUY (unless I push too hard- be gentle and don&#x27;t rush!).</li>
            <li> Last as long as the expensive german blades, at a great price. 100 blades for the price of 10 at the mall!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I realized that once I made the initial investment in a safety razor, it would be much cheaper to buy double-edged replacement blades for it than to continue to buy the disposable shavers that I had been using.  These blades work very well.  Each side is good for two to three shaves, and since I&#x27;m in that habit of shaving about five times per week, I only need to change the blade about once per week.</li>
            <li> these have become my favorite and go to first blades</li>
            <li> Is exactly what they are. Razors. A lot of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through three razors so far and they&#x27;ve been really, really good. Get&#x27;s the closest shave out of all the razors I&#x27;ve used and almost completely eliminates all the negative aspects of shaving such as razor burn and ingrown hairs. Really nice, smooth, wonderful feeling shave and for super cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades and gentle on skin. I tried feather safety blades before but I prefer this one as it fits my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many good Derby blades, however, every blade in this pack of one hundred has been extremely dull.  They do more pulling than cutting.  People usually say how many shaves a blade lasts for.  These last for 0.  I can&#x27;t return them due to them being in the health product category.  I put a vintage &#x27;80s Wilkinson Sword blade on my razor and forgot about it.  I thought I found a decent Derby blade among the bunch, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Derby blades aren&#x27;t defective, they are decent and better than Wilkinson Sword.  Not as sharp or long-lasting as Feather, but they are more forgiving of poor technique or bumpy skin and produce a smooth shave.  They also cost a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I would not gamble on a 100 pack.  They seem to be either all good or all bad, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return these.</li>
            <li> These are very consistently smooth blades and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with a safety razor for nearly 30 years. Mostly with Wilkinson blades though I have used Mekur, Astra, Feather (lost a bit of my lip to the only one I ever used) Shark, Nacet&#x27;s, Lords, Lazers and a bunch of different Japanese blades when I lived there for 4 years. Considering my local stores decided to raise the 10 pack Wilkinson prices from &amp;#60;$2 to $8 a Bulk order was in order. The reviews of Derby blades about being a less aggressive blade which with the razor burn I get on my neck is something I looked for to.  Derby&#x27;s are the first blade I have used with no learning curve. I always nick myself when I switch blades, not this time. Very happy with my shave and I have blades for the next year</li>
            <li> Great price for lots of good blades. They&#x27;re much cheaper than buying regular razor sets. They work....what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive  skin and want a bbs  shave. Works for me!</li>
            <li> This review pits the Derby blades against Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about a month now, and shave every 2-3 days. My facial hair is rather thick, and the Derby&#x27;s had no problem shearing through them.&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I decided to try out the Feathers, based off numerous recommendations. They were supposed to provide a very close shave with fewer passes (With the Derby&#x27;s I was going with the grain, across then against to achieve relatively close to BBS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feathers, as it turned out, were sharp, but would catch against the thicker spokes of hair. Additionally, they would knick any bumps on my face and cause slight bleeding. After a few shaves in, I grew so fed up with the Feathers that mid-shave I actually swapped to my last Derby blade, and finished up with no problems and super smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now purchasing 100 of these and calling it a done deal.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.... Will last a very long time.... One blade lasts quite a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of reading on blades before settling on these as my first double edge bade to start shaving with a safety razor.  Some blades have a reputation for being too dull or even overly sharp.  In terms of &amp;#34;aggressiveness&amp;#34; I would say these blades are somewhere in the middle.  They shave nice and clean and smooth when they are new.  But they aren&#x27;t overly scalpel sharp to where I worry about putting them next to my soft, fragile, handsome face.  But I have found that after about 5 shaves or so their sharpness tends to drop off.  Not to the point where they are unusable, but a marked difference in shave quality from a new blade.  Still, even after switching the blade every 5 shaves or so, this pack of 100 blades will last me ore than a year.  And at this price, how can you beat that?  No competition when it comes to the cost of these compared to $2 and $3 cartridge blades that last a week or so.  If you want a good blade in the mid-range of aggressiveness and at a pretty good price, this is your blade.  THe box comes with 20 smaller packs of 5 blades per pack.  Each individual pack is wrapped and has a slot on the bottom for discarded blades.  Good buy....good blade......good shaves.....</li>
            <li> Every blade is sharp. Able to easily cut through thick hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING! I use a safety razor and I have used a single blade for at least 2 weeks and it is still sharp. A huge bundle of these can more than easily last you a year! I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Decent shave for the price. There are many choices out there for DE blades and I just went with these. Happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> A lot of people bash Derby blades. they work great for me, but then again I don&#x27;t have a thick bushy beard. Can&#x27;t beat the price either, especially when compared to the multi blade cartridges these days.</li>
            <li> Amazing razors to go with my husband&#x27;s shaving kit. I even use it for my own womanly purposes and I haven&#x27;t had a shave like that from regular razors. Would purchase again in a heart beat! Sexy smooth legs here I come haha</li>
            <li> Dull blades providing an uncomfortable shaving experience. did not provide a smooth result, pulls on whiskers, leaves face feeling irritated. Some reviewers claim the blades are sharp, others report theirs being dull. Leads me to believe that there is poor quality control by the manufacturer. I would recommend purchasing only a minimum number of these blades at a time.</li>
            <li> Great price, does the job, but not as well as I would have imagined as a first timer. I upgraded to a premium blade, and noticed a huge difference. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these blades are fine! And work great for beginners.</li>
            <li> Derby razor blades are a super buy, and are super sharp!  I can get 3-4 shaves out of one razor and my face is like a chia pet!  I cut it, and it grows back...fast!  I would suggest this blade to anyone who is new to safety razors.  My buddy uses Derby for his straight edge too!  Great value!</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Finally, After much research, I&#x27;m using the Derbys at a rate of one a week. This costs me around $6 per year. Blades are made in Turkey and are consistent high quality. Started with Merkur blades but these are just as good. When I lather I spray a little olive oil on parts of face to get extra lubrication. After shaving I rinse blade and put a little mineral oil and stropp edges with my finger tips. Could go more that 5 shaves per blade but at 12cents a week why push it.</li>
            <li> These are totally razor blades for double edge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They save my face well. Forgiving if you make a mistake, but require perfect technique if you want a completely smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a nice hanging dispensing box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the plastic storage dudes has a sharps slot on the bottom so you can safely dispose of your old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On average I get 1-3 days out of each blade. If I make sure to dry off the blade well, and don&#x27;t make a bunch of extra passes trying to get difficult areas super smooth. I can push that to 4. Any longer and I notice the blade either beginning to rust or dull to the point that it&#x27;s unusable for me.</li>
            <li> A good razor and a good value. I really have no complaints. Razors last 5 shaves or so before needing to be replaced, IMO. Definitely can acquire a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades! I normally buy Wilkinson Sword blades, Derbys cut way easier, however being that they are that sharp, they Irritate my skin a slight bit more than Wilkinson.  Would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but, LaserShip delivered my package 3 days late, even tho i left a &amp;#34;leave at door notice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Value at 100 blades, I have been using them for awhile now. I replace the bade about 1 per week. I use them to shave my face and head.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was so impressed at how inexpensive these are and what a great value this is compared to the normal multi blades I have grown up with.  I think this could easily be a 9 to 12 month supply of blades.  It is easily 1/5 the cost of regular shaving blades.  Yes you have to have a razor that accepts these blades, but you can easily buy one of these razors for about 30 bucks-- so instead of a new pack of replacement blades from the other guy- get a safety razor and some of these blades and it will still save you a little bit of money and your shave will be even smoother!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great blades!</li>
            <li> Was optimistic about trying these blades because I hoped to find the cheapest blade that worked on my face. So it shaved decently on my right cheek with the grain, when I switched over to my left cheek after shaving my neck it was painfully pulling my hair, so I thought my lather was dry and reapplied. Did not help. (Note) my facial hair is not very thick; I&#x27;m 18 years old and my facial hair is still thickening. Sad to say but I was disappointed with these blades along with the super stainless and chrome shark blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for about 2 decades and have watched prices escalate on par with gas prices.  Now 100 Proglide cartridges would equal a monthly car payment.  I recently bought a Merkur and am not looking back.  2 middle fingers up to Gillette.</li>
            <li> Derby blades tend to get a bad reputation from the &amp;#34;elitist&amp;#34; shaving community, but as someone who shaves daily, I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better than these blades. I use one blade a week, then throw it out and replace it with a fresh one. (In case you didn&#x27;t know, the back of the Derby Box has a slot for used razors so you don&#x27;t have to throw a dangerous, sharp blade in the trash) These are as sharp as I can imagine anything being and they do the job of cutting my facial hair just as well as any blade out there. Sure, some expert shaving researchers out there have used their fancy electron microscopes to determine that some other brands have blades that are a few microns thinner, and therefore sharper, but let&#x27;s be honest, for more than twice the price is it worth it? I know, I know, the more expensive Feather blades are still a fraction of the price of cartridges, but after just one shave each blade is going to be dulled down just the same. If you are really concerned about the &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; of your razor blade, it is more important to use a fresh blade each time you shave, not to buy the &amp;#34;sharpest&amp;#34; blade out there. If you do plan on using a new blade for each shave, I would again recommend these Derby blades because lets be honest, under $10 for 100 blades is about the best deal you can get, especially since each blade has two edges. If I have done the calculations correctly, that comes down to approximately 200 sharp edges per box! With the economy the way it is, having a smooth face for such a low price is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li> These Suck. Astra rock. My whiskers must be coarse because the derby razors tore up my face. Not very sharp.</li>
            <li> There is no denying that this is cheap, but I was hoping them to be a little bit sharper since it doesn&#x27;t really give me that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> I have found the perfect balance between sharp and smooth with these gems. I would order again. Thanks Derby you are awesome!</li>
            <li> These blades are ever so slightly wider than the blades I&#x27;ve used in the past, so they leave a pointlessly small gap between the blade edge and the safety razor &amp;#34;cage&amp;#34;.  This means the blade can&#x27;t cut through beard hair without 5-6 passes since the cut hairs cannot pass through.  The blades barely cut through my wife&#x27;s baby fine leg hair, and gave her all-over shave burn she hasn&#x27;t had in years using a properly shaped double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are terrible! They went right back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought Feather after using Derby for a year. They are so much better than Derby. The Derby felt like the blade wasn&#x27;t sharpened as best as it could be. It couldn&#x27;t get the tough hairs on my neck without 10-15 strokes. Feather is much better and the blade is sharpened to a more refined finish. I can easily cut the neck hair in 5 strokes at most and the blade just feels less harsh than the Derby.</li>
            <li> I have been using double edge razors for many years and own several. These blades were &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34; by me, and so far, are a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 20 packs of five each. and the price is really a good buy, if you compare it to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each five blade pack contains individually wrapped blades, just like the way they used to come. the pack even has a used blade slot on the bottom for storage of used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I got using my murker razors was very good and I noticed that I did not get nicked like I have in the past with other brands of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the double edge system, these are a good price. And because of that, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the number of shaves on a blade, but will replace it more often, and thus eliminating the dreaded razor burn and/or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any double edge system, a good shaving cream and brush and necessary!</li>
            <li> great product and quality of blades! a must purchase blades are always Dimond sharp</li>
            <li> OK, so we&#x27;re not dealing with complex equipment. This is a double-edged razor blade that sells for we&#x27;ll under a dime.  But it is simply excellent - sharp and smooth.  So don&#x27;t over complicate things. These blades perform as intended and provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.It was my first time buying them.Planing to buy more.</li>
            <li> I prefer these blades, they are light and the coating helps them slide smoothly across the skin. I appreciate how this particular set is packaged in convenient little boxes of five, great for travel. I have always noticed that sharp new cartridge razors would irritate my neck, but would not once the razor was a bit used/dulled. So when I started shaving with a DE I figured I&#x27;d go with blades that were known to be a bit duller. Very glad I did, they seem to be the right blades for me. I had a foray using feathers and they cut less of my hair while still irritating my skin a bit, which is strange considering their reputation for sharpness. What blades are best truly relies on the individual&#x27;s skin and facial hair qualities.</li>
            <li> Love them. I really like the little cartridge to hold my used blades. They are very sharp and work great.</li>
            <li> Used these blades before and really like them. Great value for the price, and seems I now have a lifetime supply! Also quite environmentally friendly packaging compared to other disposable cartridges!</li>
            <li> They are not the best razor blades out there but they are better than I expected and really good for the price. I use them like they are,without a razor handler. I have very sensitive skin that tends to have razor bumps so far no issue.</li>
            <li> Great shave these little babies provide. Great buy,especially since the cost of shaving is going up. Order arrived lickety split. Another fine product from Turkey.</li>
            <li> A great DE blade to shave your head and beard.  No cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get three shaves per DE blade at a cost of .10 cents per DE blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great savings - no more plastic disposable razors going in the landfill for me!</li>
            <li> Works great with my EJ. Also not bad with my Merkur Vision. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great blades. I would highly recommend them. I have tried a few others, but I get a good close shave with Derby.</li>
            <li> I like these and feathers. GREAT value! These should at least be tried!  I was pleasantly surprised at the results. They last a few shaves, shave close, and are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These blades are a great compliment to the Safety Razor I purchased a couple of weeks ago.  They maintain a good edge and one blade, properly cleaned, will last for at least a week or longer.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one of these blades so far, so I could have gotten a bad blade, and while they were sharp, they just didn&#x27;t trim well at all.  It could be my facial hair, it could be my razor, but so far I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.  If you haven&#x27;t tried these yet, hold off on the bulk pack and try a sampler pack that has these in them.</li>
            <li> husband loves these and lasting forever</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I HAVE MADE IN MY LIFE. I BOUGHT THIS OVER 1.5 YEARS AGO AND STILL HAVE A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF THE BOX TO GO THROUGH. VERY ECONOMICAL. I HAVE TO SHAVE 5X A WEEK FOR WORK AND AM A PRETTY HAIRY GUY. DRY THEM OFF AFTER YOU USE THEM. MAKES THEM LAST EVEN LONGER. A WAY BETTER ROUTE TO GO INSTEAD OF SPENDING $20 ON A PACK OF QUATROS.</li>
            <li> Good for 3-4 shaves.  Perfect sharpness for my medium/light beard.</li>
            <li> Good. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Very nice blade that gives a close shave and no problems.  I&#x27;ve used the same blade for over a week and was still getting good shaves from it.  At that rate, this box will last well over a year.  I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t change blades more often, or longer, but think about it , what a bargain!</li>
            <li> WoW......this product is amazing. This is by far my greatest money saving product i purchased on amazon along with Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor</li>
            <li> Great quality and price for the amount of blades. Fit perfectly into my Edwin Jagger double edge safety razor. Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I have been DE shaving for about a month and a half now. I have tried merkur razors, astras, derby, and van der hagen. Among these, derby is the worst by far and astras are by far the best for my face. I have not had a single good shave with derby razors. I get cut up like never before and it creates razor bumps and irritation unlike my current favorite, astra. They are relatively the same price so go with the much better options out there... you are welcome!</li>
            <li> I like these blades over others I have tried. I have fewer nicks, cuts using these maybe because they are not as sharp. I would rather make an extra pass with my razor if it means reducing the amount of blood I will shed after I shave.</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this blade because I had try so many others that were not working well. This razor is very comfortable and offers me an excellent /comfortable shave. I would recomend it to anyone who needs a clean shave and suffers from ugly razor bumps.</li>
            <li> By far, the sharpest blades I have ever had in 40 years!  After 3 weeks of use they are still shaper and smoother than a new Gillette out of the box!</li>
            <li> Ive been using safety razors for the last several years and have finally found the right razor blade. I&#x27;ve used various brands (merkor, feather, etc) and the Derby&#x27;s are my favorite by far. They&#x27;re perfect for beginners or those that don&#x27;t have much patience and like a quick shave. They are also an amazing value. $10 for 100 razors!!!??? That&#x27;s insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick hair so blades dull quickly for me. Although the Feathers are extremely sharp, I always manage to mangle my face with them. Maybe im shaving too quickly but my face always ends up being cut to hell. The Merkors are dull and never give me a quality shave. The Derbys are very forgiving and gave me the same quality, close shave that i get with the Feather blades but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend these enough. Im probably going to stick with these for a very very long time. Remember that lubrication is important!!!! Don&#x27;t skimp on the soap/cream. Kiss my face brand shaving cream is my favorite and goes perfect with these blades. BUY THESE NOW</li>
            <li> These are my go to blades. They provide me the closest shave without getting dangerously close to shaving my face off! Better than the standard blade that came with my Merkur safety razor. I get about 10 days out of a blade before I need to replace one. Great price on Amazon when you buy the 100 pack.</li>
            <li> Bought these with a new Weishi premium long handle razor, they work great. I saw some reviewers stating that a few other brands may be sharper, I doubt that but &amp;#34;even if&amp;#34; these are still plenty sharp and I would recommend to anyone. I use them to shave my head and a straight razor on my face so I have a lot of faith in these for a close shave without blood loss.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and did research online to find a good blade recommendation for a beginner. This blade was very widely used by new shavers. A 5 pack of these blades were also included with my razor.  The price was very competitive and I felt I had very little at risk so I ordered these to accompany my Edwin Jagger DE89LBL. I have been using these for about 3 weeks now and have gotten good performance from them. I can get 5-6 good shaves from each blade but I have decided to change them every 3 shaves. They are inexpensive and perform VERY well for about 4-5 shaves so why not change them slightly more frequently than necessary and great shave everytime. I will try other blades over time, but these blades are more than satisfactory to give me a smooth clean shave that exceeds cartridges closeness. Great blade...Great price...Great result.</li>
            <li> perfect.. I had my doubts at first because i usually use shark razors but after trying them, i&#x27;ll never go back, quick delivery and great product.. love it</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and is such a great value! Definitely will buy again in the future, which will be a while from now since there&#x27;s 100 of them!</li>
            <li> These blades were just ok for me at best. They gave me more nicks and an overall rougher shave than the personna and gillete 7 o&#x27;clock yellow blades, which are my favorites so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 24 pack of derby&#x27;s and a 4 pack of shark super stainless that I would like to trade for any other brand if anybody is interested.</li>
            <li> Even though these are not the sharpest blades on earth, they gave me the best shave with a DE razor I&#x27;ve ever had. SMOOTH,SMOOTH.SMOOTH</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 packs of 100 of Derby Extra blades and I love them. I compared these blades to my Merkur Super blades and both blades are identical in size. Length, width and thickness of both blades are identical. Even the cut out slot in the center are identical to each other. I flexed both blades and the torsional force required to bend both blades feel the same. If these two blades didn&#x27;t have any printing I couldn&#x27;t tell them apart. So far I&#x27;m extremely happy with their performance. These Derby Extra blades have a coating of platinum, chromium, tungsten and other polymers to make the shave more comfortable. Other cheaper model Derby blades may not have the extra coating, but Derby Extra models have them. These blades come 5 pieces in a plastic container with an empty slot to used/discarded blades in the back. Each blade is individually wrapped in paper. There are 20 plastic containers in the package totaling 100 blades at a bargain price. Currently you can&#x27;t find a better blade than these at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain certain model blades are &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34;. Frankly I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s supposed to mean. I&#x27;ve never experienced the phenomenon of a blade being &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34;. A complaint accusing a blade for being too sharp is an oxymoron to me, like a car tire is too perfectly round.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for $10 they come prepacked in little plastic boxes inside the big cardboard one. Very smooth shave, and I have coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading all the reviews and seeing the pictures, and all I can say is this:&lt;br /&gt;I shave my beard and (bald) head with these blades and 1 blade so far has lasted my 6 shaves (about a month) and that&#x27;s only one side. They label these 1234 for each edge, top and bottom (one side 1 and 2/flip side 3 and 4), so you can wear it out evenly. By the numbers I should get 10 YEARS! of use from 7 DOLLARS! If you&#x27;re reading this I wouldn&#x27;t go for anything else.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, inexpensive but high in quality. I just began safety razor shaving and am loving it. It only took me a few shaves to become somewhat proficient in it. these blades are great for beginners, I rarely cut myself and when I did it was because I was pushing the razor instead of letting the weight of the razor do all the work. these blades are very forgiving, I can get at least 3 shaves out of one razor but I usually shave with a new one every time since they are so cheap. I want to try the sharpest blades available but I love these so much and don&#x27;t have any need to switch.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these blades. Price is great and so is performance. No irritation and rarely do I cut myself with these. Will be buying again when they run out.</li>
            <li> For my money it doesn&#x27;t get better than Derby blades.  Feathers are sharper at first, but become unusable after a couple of shaves.  I think Merkurs are too blunt, and unforgiving. These Derby blades are perfect for an every day shave.</li>
            <li> Meh, the didnt work so well for my face.  I just felt they weren&#x27;t very sharp and didn&#x27;t last more than one shave on my 20 grit facial hair.... For this price, you cant fail by trying them.  It took several attempts to find the right razor that worked best on my face.  Try them, you might like them.  Otherwise, if they dont work well for you, you can do like I do and keep them as back ups for when you unexpectedly run out of blades!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razors they dont leave razor burn and get close to the skin.They also last a long time because there are 100 of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my double edge razor. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about blades for like a year.</li>
            <li> Super cheap blades. I love the close cut it provides. Each blade lasts about 4-5 shaves. I bought the blades ~1.5 yrs ago and I think it will last me a couple more months. The sticky adhesive on the back isn&#x27;t so much of a negative doesn&#x27;t really affect the blade edge.</li>
            <li> Bit too dull for my Edwin Jagger DE razor - nice blade but not for me personally. Prefer Personna and Feather blades...</li>
            <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> Bought it several years ago. still have some today. i do knick myself a bit but thats onn me not on the blades. theyre sharp.</li>
            <li> I like these blades.  I do not have a very coarse beard and can get 5-7 shaves out of each blade doing 3-4 passes with each shave. I will buy these again when my supply starts running low.</li>
            <li> A Great Value. Derby&#x27;s are the most comfortable and closest shaves i have gotten when compared to other blades. It was a no brainer to get a 100 ct. and just keep them in storage until needed. These&#x27;ll last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> This generally are great blades. My husband uses them everyday. Occasionally he gets a bad blade though that must have a small nick or flaw in it that cuts up his skin and he has to get rid of it right away and go to the next one in the box. Still worth the price we paid for all of them together.</li>
            <li> These are not the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve tried, but they do a satisfactory job at a great volume for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my first DE attempt. They are somewhat forgiving and last be through several shaves, but do dull out eventually. Great value for a 100 pack and will probably last me 1-2 yrs. No complaints, but will try another type just to compare.</li>
            <li> These blades are a great value.  It is not easy to find this kind a baled any more at your local drugstore or the big name cvs and walgreens.  You really can only get them in high end shaving shops and they are expensive  So great value here</li>
            <li> I went from using Gilette blades, whatever the 5-blade disposable head ones that cost in the neighborhood of $17 for 8 (maybe 4, can&#x27;t remember).  I went straight to these with shaving soap, and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I would recommend these to anyone, as they last longer and seem to cut better than any disposable I&#x27;ve ever used, along with being a small fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also usually shave my head, but I don&#x27;t recommend a double edged razor for that.  It&#x27;s a touch to easy to slide the razor sideways while running it along your head, and the 3 times I tried it I both cut myself and missed at least a few spots.  I keep some double-blade disposables around for when I start to shave my head again.  The hair on one&#x27;s head is typically much finer than that of a beard, so the blades last far longer for that than they ever did with my face.</li>
            <li> Take your time to do a proper wet shave and these will be one of the smoothest blades you&#x27;ll ever use. I do a 3 pass shave with these and never have I had razor burn or bumps show up afterwards. First pass with the grain, second pass across the grain, and third pass against the grain.</li>
            <li> Bought a hundred pack that I just finished.  Not on the same level as an Israeli red personna or a japanese feather.  Quality has diminished since construction left great Britain.</li>
            <li> When I initially started shaving with Double edge razor blades, I bought several sampler packs (which have a bunch of different brands) and spent a lot of time deciding which brand I liked. Different brands are made with different materials, quality, and sharpness. MY experience has shown me the Derbys excel in all categories. Their materials and quality seem top notch as the razors are long lasting and give a great shave while their sharpness is also great too. Not nearly as sharp as some brands who focus on being extra sharp, the Derbys are the perfect balance of sharpness in my opinion. Sharp enough for a great shave but not sharp enough that you&#x27;ll need a PhD in shaving to get an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> I have gone through about 8 of these blades (two months worth of shaving) and they don&#x27;t give a very good shave and tend to irritate my skin. Just this morning I switched to a Wilkinson Sword Blade and I have to say the shave was noticeably better, and the irritation was noticeably less. Anybody want a great deal on some unopened Derby razor blades ?</li>
            <li> Finally! I found the secret to smooth shaves. I spent months adjusting to ( and almost giving up on) wet shaving. I thought sharper was better in a bald but my use of Persona, Feather, and other brands known for being super sharp only resulted in lots of painful razor burn no matter how carefully I shaved. I switched to Derby, the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand and instantly my problems were solved! Everyone has a different face and different beard so someone with thick, wiry whiskers probably would benefit from the sharper brands. Not me. This is all I use now. Going back to Feather a couple times resulted in a return of razor burn. Find the right blade for your skin! Don&#x27;t just listen to who claims to be the sharpest. Sharper is not better for everyone.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just blades, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with that. Make sure to buy just one and NOT SUBSCRIBE, otherwise they&#x27;ll keep sending you one every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to review Amazon products, but I felt that this was good enough to break me from my stereotypical apathy. The blades themselves are the exact quality I expected them to be, and I was absolutely delighted with the speed of the delivery of this product. All in all, a good purchase; this is something that I would (and probably will) buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly sensitive face, and these blades last me 2-3 shaves.  The first shave, is smoother than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my &amp;#34;Merkur 180&amp;#34; razor and am extremely pleased.  Provides a far superior shave to any cartridge style razor I have ever used and is considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you are feeling confused by the constant chatter in reviews about the comparisons of blade sharpness between brands or which blades are cleaner out of the packaging look no further, this blade works. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the one blade I have loaded into my Gillette has lasted me for about eight shaves. I have the ability to grow a full beard so with each shave I am plowing through a lot of stubble and even with that fact in mind these Derby blades have not failed to give me a close shave. However, it is time to change the blade in my opinion now that I am moving on to the ninth shave because it is just starting to tug at the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as sharpness goes I am not a very good at judge on the quality between blades. Though if I had to rank blades I would say it is sharper than Sharks, but not quite as sharp as the German Wilkinson Swords. However, they are cleaner than both blades coming out of their wax paper sheath. Regardless of those two factors, I like these blades and will be getting more. This pack of 100 will last me a VERY long time and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Pretty cut and dry product here. These are very simply razors I&#x27;ve been using with no issues whatsoever. Good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle the sharper stuff, but usually after one shave these derbys fall apart. Because I can get so many for so cheap, it&#x27;s not a tough call for me to get one shave out of the each blade and just toss it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price but I purchased this brand after using a sampler pack to determine which brand and variety.  I just started to use a safety razor in the winter after being dissatisfied with the price of razors.  These caused the least irritation and cut very easily even on the second stroke.  I use each blade for about three days.  Very sharp so be careful, I just pitch in trash since but you can put back into the container the blades come.</li>
            <li> A Derby Extra razor blade was included free with my recently purchased Muhle R41 safety razor.  The blade only lasted a week.  I was going to give it a bad review until I saw the price.  A week&#x27;s worth of shaving for under 10 cents?  2 years of razor blades for $10?  That&#x27;s a 5 star value in my book.  Bye bye Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Great blades, very reliable and at a great price</li>
            <li> For face shaving I recommend staying with the stainless blades, but for my head shaves, these seem to cause fewer scalp nicks. Amazingly inexpensive and very effective especially for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great value! Double edge blades are the most subjective thing in the world. You just have to try a bunch and see which one works out, but this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> i like these blades, they are what i was looking for and work well. the only thing is that they dont have the closest shave and tug a little bit at my hair but other than that they work great!</li>
            <li> I am returning 7 out of the 10 packs, they are worthless. I have bought double edge razor blades on Amazon and I was always satisfied, this time, I was a fiasco. All of the blades that I have used are DULL!&lt;br /&gt;I need an address to ship them back to for a partial refund</li>
            <li> I got these when I was new to wet-shaving because they were cheap, they were the blades that came with my razor, and they had good reviews here.  I struggled with them for awhile, figuring my technique, prep, etc. was wrong.  This proved to be true, but even as I&#x27;ve gotten better, I&#x27;m still having a hard time with these blades.  I get a lot of irritation and weeping despite good prep and technique.  These blades also just kill my neck.  I&#x27;ve much better success and would suggest that anyone starting to wet-shave try a sample pack of blades, rather than these.  If you already know that you like these, then the price I found on Amazon was the best I could find and the service/shipping was great as always.</li>
            <li> I shave sporadically, so I go from smooth to scruffy, every few days.  So, I&#x27;m usually shaving a thicker beard.  These have lasted me 3 or 4 shaves before replacement.  No cuts, no nicks, and doesn&#x27;t clog like the twin and triple and whatever else they&#x27;re selling these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proviso:  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of double edged razor to compare to.</li>
            <li> These razor blades seem dull at best. I&#x27;m using them with a  merkur future and merkur long handle and they seem to be good to use once and then throw away. I find myself constantly having to replace them. I used ASTRA in the past and they seem to be sharper and last longer (I can get four shaves out of one blade) and they are about the same price. Then again, what works for me may not work for you. Good luck.</li>
            <li> just be careful when you shave with those :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 blade is enough for 6-8 shavings.&lt;br /&gt;So 100 blades should last me a while :)</li>
            <li> We got it for the Merkur HD 34C, Chrome Plated razor. Husband has no complaints about this system. Works well!</li>
            <li> I recently rediscovered double edge razors, trying to save money over the multi-blade cartridges that have become too expensive. These are good, packaged in convenient 5-blade dispensers, which will be useful when traveling. I think I like the Personna blades better, though.</li>
            <li> Great blades for the money! I don&#x27;t shave every day, but 100 will easily last 2yrs w/ my Merkur safety razor. Speedy shipment too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Look at the price of these 100 blades. Now go look at the price of just 6 Mach 3 blades or some other lousy setup. Now look at the price of these 100 blades again. Do the math and save yourselves from the marketing nightmare. Get these blades and convert to old school shaving. So much cheaper and better!</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite blades for my DE. A smooth shave and the price won&#x27;t break the bank! I&#x27;d recommend these to any DE lover!</li>
            <li> As a newbie de wet shaver I bought these blades on amazon as they were the cheapest on this site. I also bought the Lord L6 on this site too. Some experienced wet shavers advocate getting a sample pack of different brands of de blades to see which ones agrees to your razor, beard, and skin type.  However, I further read where it would be better to get a 100 pack of blades of only one brand and work on your shaving technique as you are new to this type of shaving.  So that&#x27;s what I did.  These blades are plenty sharp for me! On my 3rd shave I attained BBS on my cheeks and very close to BBS below my neck.  My technique is improving and my face is getting used to this type of shaving too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these as they are the cheapest!</li>
            <li> Great Swedish blades for the money, very sharp, depending on your beard can use each blade up to a week.</li>
            <li> I know that every face is different, and different blades suit peoples faces better than others, but this is a blade that i read good things about, but has only caused my face irritation. It either cuts my face too much, or doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs cleanly or well at all. Really hard on my sensitive neck. At first i though i just needed to improve my technique with this blade, but after trying Astra blades, I realized it was that the Derby blade was not a good match for my face. i had great success with Astra and no irritation whatsoever, and they would just glide through and slice all the hairs cleanly and with ease. I have since retried with the derby blade, and same results, tons of irritation, or no close shave at all.</li>
            <li> Good blades for entry into world of double-edged shaving.  Not too razor sharp, so great for beginners, and price of about 10 cents/blade is economical for one-shave average/blade.</li>
            <li> Razors for life!  Clean packaging, and well its perfect if you use a double edge safety!</li>
            <li> Each one is individually packed in a set of 5 in a hard plastic case, much better than what I had before.  Tried for the first time, good quality.</li>
            <li> These work great.  Husband loves them. He is on second box with no complaints and great shaves.  Will continue to order these blades.</li>
            <li> I used to buy a generic pack of 10 DE blades from the local box store. As my DE razor experience grew I purchased a variety pack from Amazon which included Derby blades. The Derby&#x27;s are BY FAR the best blades for MY face. So, what works for me might not work for you. That being said....I love the Derby&#x27;s. The blades are just sharp enough (no razor burn yet) to give me a nice smooth shave. I change the blade out every 5 days and even on change day I get an incredible shave. Will not go back to the generic blades every again. Derby blades from here on out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start using my dad&#x27;s old razor but its not in the best of shape. so going to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blade. Great Price.</li>
            <li> I bought these with my first safety razor; I saw other negative reviews but since I have pretty light facial hair I figured they would work alright. Boy, was I wrong about that. The blades are dull and require a lot of work to get an even moderately close shave. Even worse, they feel like they have small burrs on them, because even when I&#x27;m really careful these things end up giving me cuts, which almost never happens with higher-quality blades. Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying these by the low price, either. You won&#x27;t be able to shave with these more than once or twice before shaving goes from uncomfortable to downright intolerable. I purchased some Wilkinson Sword blades, which are about 50% more expensive, and got a much better shave. They last longer than the Derbies, too, so the price difference isn&#x27;t even a reason to buy Derby blades. I imagine this is the case for other blades as well.</li>
            <li> These are the first DE blades I&#x27;ve used, and found them to be very dull. I though it was my technique, or just how DE shaving is, but I tried some other blades from the drugstore and they work great. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard either.</li>
            <li> Best blades for my beard! Cheap enough to throw away after a use or two as well! Box looks sweet on the shelf with all the cool Arabic writing on it too!</li>
            <li> for the price these blades arent bad...i do prefer feather brand but these are good value. personally....i wont rebuy these but have no problem giving them away to friends that i convert to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> I have had a little experience with a few other blades such as Wilkinson&#x27;s, Gillette and Personna. I find these blades to be a good value for the price and also fairly similar to other blades I have used. I&#x27;m no connoisseur, so perhaps there are minute differences that other people notice that I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find when the blade is fresh, the first usage causes me a couple of cuts it is so sharp I would say almost too sharp! The second and third shaves are the best with this blade, then the fourth shave I sometimes have to change out mid shave because it is not cutting well enough. Honestly, this is very similar performance to all other brands I have tried so I just go with these because they are a very good price bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe my face as having skin sensitivity a 6 on a 1-10 scale and my beard hair thickness/toughness an 8/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with a &amp;#34;Diamond Edge Professional Straight Razor&amp;#34; (you can find here on amazon for about $7) which the disposable Derby blades fits well and with no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades after not using a double edge razor since I was in basic training in 1967. Great blades.</li>
            <li> Its a good deal for a lot of razors. I dont think ill ever run out again. There very sharp too.</li>
            <li> I tried these because I was tired of buying Mach3 cartridges at about $25 a pack, for an unenjoyable daily face-scraping. I don&#x27;t pay a buck a day to brush my teeth or comb my hair, so a great shave should be no different. Traditional wet-shaving with these blades has been the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about beard reduction with each easy pass (rather than beard removal in one chiselfest), going with the grain, and not pressing hard on your skin. It took a couple weeks&#x27; practice and one or two good YouTube vids, but stainless steel dual edge blades shave as well or better than Mach3 or other cartridge disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried a very diverse multi-brand sample pack and found that Derby and Blue Bird were the best blades for me. (Better than Feather for daily shaving, IMHO.) At this price it&#x27;s easy to refill often, but I grow a moderate beard and if I have to I can get two weeks&#x27; use out of each blade by flipping it over after the first week. In fact, the edges are numbered and can be rotated four times -- each edge of each side -- if you really want to stretch them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each blade costs about a dime; for me, that&#x27;s less than one cent per shave. So this pack of blades will last me over three years. I have to say that again: a penny per shave for over three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMA, Gillette.</li>
            <li> I starting wetshaving a while back.&lt;br /&gt;I started out with a sampler pack, and was glad I was able to try many different blades.&lt;br /&gt;However, The Derby Extra has always been the top  performer for me- it has given me the closest, most comfortable shave ever!&lt;br /&gt;I was so sad when I ran out of these blades from the sample pack. I have tried all the blades from the pack, plus others I bought on my own. I still have many of the other blades left but I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back to my favorite blade!!!&lt;br /&gt;I know with DE blades it&#x27;s what works for you, everyone is different but in my opinion, these blades simply can&#x27;t be beat!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give them a try! Maybe they will be your favorite blade too!!!</li>
            <li> gave it 5 stars great buy, alot of blades for a cheap price and they get the job done&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> I had never tried this brand of blades before in my safety razor, and I was nervous making this purchase since all blades are different.  I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the blades and smoothness of the shave, as compared to other brands Shark and Wilkinson Swords. Less than $8 is an incredible price for 100 blades, so I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> New to Safety Razors and just went with these as part of a suggestion package.  The first time didn&#x27;t go so well but I think it was because I didn&#x27;t let the weight of the razor do the work.  So I had some bleeding.  Not the blades fault.  The second and third shave was fantastic. Zero bleeding.  I shave once a week usually (I can let it get pretty scruffy because I work from home) and I get about 3 shaves per blade.  I&#x27;m Irish so I can get a pretty thick beard going and it still plows right through it after a weeks growth.  I could stretch it to 4 times I am sure but no need to at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 3 shaves per blade at 100 blades is about 5 and half years of shaving. Wow.. And to think I was paying 30 or 40 bucks for 6 cartridge razors that would last like two months</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and these blades did an awesome job. As an African American guy I am very prone to ingrown hairs, but these blades cut at just the right length to make my face look good and not irritate my skin. For 7 bucks and some change how can you beat it?</li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ve scraped my face over 15000 times and I still use the Gillette Fat Boy my father gave me.  He used Wilkinson Sword blades and I&#x27;ve tried many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These &#x27;Derby&#x27; blades are good for me for 3 shaves before they start to pull, meaning they need to be replaced.  I use a 6 setting on the fat boy although your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather&#x27;s give me 5 shaves reliably and Wilkinson Swords give me 5 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, if you are lucky.  I&#x27;ll be buying 100&#x27;s of Wilkinson Swords in the future.  Best bang for the buck in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my thoughts.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and as sharp as you could want them to be. A shave as good as any brand new, 5 blade razor. What more need be said?</li>
            <li> Being a life long DE wet shaver, I have tried many blades. Blades are a very personal choice I have found, and what works for me may not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a very coarse beard, I like a more aggressive razor such as a Gillette red tip, with a sharp blade for light strokes. These blades work very nice, but keep in mind they are not known as being as sharp as other blades. I can only get 3 shaves (3 passes) before they need replacing. That is really good value since that is all I get from a Feather too (albeit the feather is wicked smooth since it is equally wicked sharp requiring excellent lathering technique). Wilkinson Sword is a bit better in that they will last me nearly a week, but not quite as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone new to DE shaving, I think these are nearly the perfect blade, being very forgiving with a good quality lather. But remember everyone has different results, so try several brands before you judge any.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few non-Russian blades that work well for me. Of all the blades I use, this one provides the smoothest and most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I received a 5 pack of Derby blades with my Edwin Jagger De89bl and I have to say that that the handle is amazing, but the Derby blades are lacking. As compared to other blades that I have tried, they are extremely dull and I could only get one shave out of the blade without the blade grabbing my hair. With that being said, I have a fairly thick beard and although these blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as others, they are probably fine for a person with lighter facial hair. These blades would definitely work, but I would be going through them at a faster rate than others, making the price equal out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research, and find the blade that is good for you! I personally like Feather and Wilkinson Sword so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest going to Shaving 101 to read their article on \\&quot;Choosing the Right Blade\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> About a year ago my husband was introduced to the world of double edge shaving. We bought him a sampler pack of blades among other things and he took a few months to hone his technique and learn the different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the blades tried, this one landed at the top of the heap so we bought a box. He has been very happy with these blades. Not everyone is as every beard is different but this one is the winner for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving it is strongly recommended that you pick up a blade sampler pack (there are many available here on Amazon) so you can figure out which blade best suits your needs without having to buy 100 of each type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Derbys, these are great blades and the price can&#x27;t be beat. No more overpriced disposable razors for us!</li>
            <li> Product came as described in a timely manor. Packaging makes dispensing blades easy. Gave three stars because I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet. The blades that came with my razor are lasting very well so I haven&#x27;t gone through them yet. I may update after a trial of them in a couple months.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, not expensive at all. Shave so nice and smooth with these blades and were highly reccomended by other users.</li>
            <li> Good blades for a good price.</li>
            <li> I decided to give wet shaving a try, and based on so many excellent reviews, picked up a box of 100 of these blades along with my new razor. After a couple weeks of shredding my face with two different razors, I was about to throw in the towel. I figured I just didn&#x27;t have the touch to do it right. But for kicks one day in the store I decided to try a pack of regular old Wilkinson blades from Walmart. I can&#x27;t write what I felt here when replacing the Derbys with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden I am an expert. No burn. No nicks. No cuts. A perfect smooth shave with the feel of hair being cut rather than torn. The only way I can describe the feeling of this blade across your skin, is as if it were a serrated blade rather than smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at a loss to the praise these blades receive. All I can think is their beards are wispy soft blonde angel hair, because these things cut like a 4 year old Feather blade after 300 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on trying them, please try a sample pack first, because you don&#x27;t want to get stuck with 100 POS blades like I did.</li>
            <li> After you buy a decent safety razor, I guess you can save money using these blades. I change the blade about every 5th shave, so this box should be good for about 1 1/2 years. Delivery was mixed with other items, came fairly quickly; packaging is good. Overall a decent deal.</li>
            <li> Let me start with this: I think razor blade reviews can be very misleading. Unless a razor comes damaged, it&#x27;s hard to give a good or bad review. If they are well produced then it becomes a preference issue. So, let&#x27;s say Derby razors are well constructed and well priced, &#x27;nough said. Now, the important part: Is it for me? I think the only way to communicate this is to tell you about my facial skin. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m Asian American (so you better understand the facial hair). I have to use certain facial lotions or I break out (I&#x27;m in my later 30&#x27;s, not a teen). I&#x27;m also prone to getting ingrown hairs when I shave. My facial hair is thin, wirey, and straight; if i grew it out, I would have a fu manchu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I first got my first safety razor, I did what most do. I bought a sampler package from the many independent sellers on Amazon. This is the smartest thing one can do. Finding razor blade is like Goldilocks and The 3 Bears--what might be right for you, may not be right for some. Derby razors are not the sharpest, but that&#x27;s fine. They are sharp enough before my skin can start feeling it. People love Astra razors. It&#x27;s too sharp for my skin. This is with the knowledge that Astra razors aren&#x27;t even the sharpest razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say my second favorite are Shark razors. But they are not as sharp as Derby&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope review this will be helpful for some potential buyers.</li>
            <li> After 3 shaves a butter knife would work better......................Stainless steel is poor quality as evidenced by the rust marks on the blades.</li>
            <li> These are just ok. I bought a bunch because of the price, but they only seem to last a few (4) shaves. They&#x27;re also not as smooth as the platinum coated ones I tried, but slightly better than the cheapo brand.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Lathers nicely and leaves you with a manly smell.</li>
            <li> Derby razors give the best value for the shave. Good for four shaves and a decent shave on the fifth. Forgiving razor.</li>
            <li> sometimes hard to find blades my drug store barely stocks double edge blades never in these quantity stock up save money</li>
            <li> These give me a good shave and the cost savings is insane. It works out to be about 8 cents a blade, with each blade lasting me about a week. Compare that to $4 per cartridge for a Mach 3 Turbo and it&#x27;s a total win in my book.</li>
            <li> I love the Derby&#x27;s--not too dull , not too sharp, but just right! 3-4 great shaves on a 10 cent blade, priceless!</li>
            <li> Used for a few shaves. Got a sample pack with [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]]They are razor blades so obviously sharp, but probably only as sharp as a disposable razor. If you have thin facial hair or sensitive skin these will work. But for the Grizzly man beard that I have I will be trying Wilkinson and Feather Blades.</li>
            <li> Happy ,Happy ,Happy,  I can get three weeks and some time more per blade ,very  close shave, I&#x27;ve saved many dollars over the throw away razors. would recommend getting Cremo  Cream  works very well for a  close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the exorbitant cost of blades for Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 and Quattro I decided to return to a double edge razor.  It&#x27;s been decades since I relied on a DE so the biggest challenge was to pick a razor. I chose the Edwin Jagger De89lbl and it came with a 5-pack of Derby Extra blades.  I figured a quality razor manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t include a substandard blade so at the time I ordered the razor I also ordered this 100 pack of Derbys and I&#x27;ve been very happy with them.  The Gillette Quattro gives a very close shave but the Derby blade in the Edwin Jagger beats it.  I had forgotten what a truly close shave is!  I&#x27;m getting about 3 shaves per blade, I could probably stretch that to 4 or 5 but with the cost so low I see no reason to pinch the pennies that hard.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this blade and when the time comes to order more I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be Derby.</li>
            <li> These are the DE blades for me.  Cuts nice and smooth in almost any DE razor.  They are on the gentle side of the spectrum so if you have sensitive skin they are great.  Price is fantastic... if you know you like Derby&#x27;s pull the trigger on these!</li>
            <li> Great set of blades.  How can you go wrong for a 100 at this price.  I think I bought them 3 years ago, maybe more and I haven&#x27;t even used half of them.  Get yourself a good razor to hold them.  I have a Parker, but I hear Merkur is good too. Then buy these blades and you will be set for years.  Even if you use one a week they will still last 2 years.  I find I can go 2-3 weeks even a month before they need replacing.</li>
            <li> Been using these for about 3 months. as with most razors, they&#x27;re harsh fresh. I got about 6 shaves with one blade with about 3 weeks of beard growth. Make sure that you use a preshave routine with these razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  using Derby Extra blades for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s a sharp blade and it delivers an excellent shave. I was very happy to find these at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I got this blade in a sample pack. I got an ok shave with this but nothing that stood out as something I would really want to keep or buy in bulk as my primary blade. I got 3 good shaves out it before it started to get dull. I use a good amount of lather and consistent shave angle. On the 4th shave, i felt a little tugging and pulling.</li>
            <li> Great value. 100 blades for less than the cost of two on the modern blade cartridges. The old school razor works just as well as the modern 4 blade cartridges and the blades last just as long.&lt;br /&gt;This pack of blades along with a Merkur safety razor will save big $$$ over the long run.</li>
            <li> I suppose there are about 20 little plastic containers in here, that hold 5 blades wrapped in wax paper, with a blade disposal slot in the back of the container. These blades aren&#x27;t shockingly sharp, but they work for shaving my beard and head.</li>
            <li> Blades are thin, well coated and sharp. Great price when buying bulk -- I should have these for at least two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using DE blades for about 6 mos after 30 years with various more &#x27;modern&#x27; cartridge style blades. Really my only experience is with Feather and these Derby blades. I think maybe these are not quite as sharp as Feathers but they are plenty sharp for me and not even half the cost. I have a bit of a goatee and shave every other day. I get about two weeks out of one blade with these which is about 7 or so shaves. They are so cheap at about 10c a blade, you could use a new blade every day if you really wanted. However it is a bit of a pain to actually change a DE blade. So yeah, a hundred of these will last you a while. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a patchy beard but I also wanted a nice and smooth shave. This is sharp enough to give me that smooth shave but isn&#x27;t aggressive enough to scrape my skin raw.</li>
            <li> Look, let&#x27;s face it, these are not $1 a piece blades.  You just paid $10 for 100 of them.  That said, they won&#x27;t last as long as a Merkur or a Feather.  They are decently sharp and do exactly as needed when you pop them in.  I&#x27;ve got a fairly rough beard and when I got done I had a close shave with no nicks.  Now, I also use pre-shave oil, which helps a lot.  I also use the correct technique so I&#x27;m less prone to cuts anyway.  Will they only last a shave or two for you?  If your beard is thick it is possible.  For 10¢ a blade, I have no problem with disposing of them after a shave or two.  I&#x27;m still saving considerable money over the cartridge blades.  But that&#x27;s not why I DE shave.  Some do it because of less razor burn.  Not me.  I do it because I enjoy doing it.  I always want to enjoy doing whatever I do in life and wasn&#x27;t going to make an exception with shaving.  While it make not make me feel at the level of manliness of Chuck Norris, what could?  It still makes me feel good.  That&#x27;s a story for another time, let&#x27;s get back to the blades.  They come conveniently packaged in 20 plastic boxes of 5 razors.  Each box is wrapped in cellophane, which helps keep moisture out.  You can slide the used blades in a slit in the box made for this purpose.  I would not recommend this product for a first time DE shaver, and here is why:  There are almost as many types of blades as there are faces.  Each one is different and will work different for a different shaver.  You would be best off starting with a sample pack, and go from there.  Anyway, as always, Keep Calm and Shave On!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it&#x27;s amazing! These blades give for a nice close shave. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but what I have, has thick hairs. One of these blades lasts a week for me.</li>
            <li> I get a closer shave with the Derby Razors, Also these blades are very affordable, I intend to order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this 100 count pack thinking the bargain was worth the risk on a new blade. (Not wise, i know). Well price wise, its a good deal, however, the blade itself almost ruined wet shaving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how often I change the blade, it seems dull. It&#x27;s sharp enough to cut me, but not sharp enough to cleanly shave. I have cut myself and started getting razor burn again. My beard isn&#x27;t even that thick. These are not for me, and after giving it several tries (trying to save face (no pun intended), i pushed through gone 3-4 packs of blades), I reached my breaking point today and called it quits.</li>
            <li> Had some of these come with a razor that I ordered.  Really wasn&#x27;t impressed with them, and found that just after a few days that blades seems to have pull on the hair.  However, I switched to personna blades which are more expensive, but they are much sharper and seem to last much longer.  I will also note that my hair is fine, and even so I could still tell a large difference.  Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in nicks, being every so often.</li>
            <li> I will give this a 5 star review because the product performed exactly as expected.  These blades, however, do not agree greatly with my skin.  Others do not have this issue.  I just need a sharper blade to reduce irritation in my neck and moustache region.  For the price, however?  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  You can seriously use these blades one time and throw it away, while still shaving daily, and still save money from the ridiculous cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all blades, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> These are my go-to blades for wet-shaving.  I have a heavy beard, my hairs are very thick, and I always want a blade that will stand up to my whiskers.  I usually shave my neck, leaving the facial area alone. These blades have a good edge that they keep for more cycles than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I got these a YEAR ago and I&#x27;m still going through them. These work great with a straight razor. I use them about twice (to shave my legs) and then switch it out for a new one...they give a nice close shave with minimal cuts and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades gives a really close shave and also have very good prices. I would suggest these blades. A blade last me 7 days and i shave my head and face 7 days a week. The one thing I will say I hear this all the time about what brands to buy and usually you hear the name feather.  Botttom line agree with me or not all blades are razor sharp as long as they are platinum coated. When using a DE razor I will highly suggest everyone to clean there blades with sterile alcohol it will keep the blades clean of bacteria and will be less chances of acne, DE razor shaving removes dead skin clean your blades and they will last derby  blades prices are unbeatable and to me they arr the exact same as feather</li>
            <li> Love the shave.  Love the # of shaves I get on each blade.  Love the # of blades in the box.</li>
            <li> I chose a 5-star review for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-I paid only $.10 a blade, cheaper than disposables&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are sharp and provide a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about these Derby Razor Blades is the following:&lt;br /&gt;-The blades come in packs of 5 and are individually wrapped&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are numbered 1 and 2 on one side and 3 and 4 on the other side&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are as sharp as any other blades I&#x27;ve ever bought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who I would recommend this to:&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has a safety razor who is looking to stock up on some blades; this was truly an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price and you sure won&#x27;t run out anytime soon! Be careful if you are new to using these, they take some getting used to and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with this blade back in April and was very impressed.  Very sharp and no nicks or irritation near the neck area.  Like many of you I tried some other brands, e.g. Merkur and Astra blades but I always keep coming back to these.  I have a pretty thick beard so I can get two shaves from one blade but I would suggest you replace it daily if you want the closest shave.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with these and have learned my lesson, stick with these and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Make sure you prep your face prior to shaving and use a good post shave lotion.</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely terrible.  I don&#x27;t know how so many people can write such glowing reviews.  They only last one or two shaves, whereas the Merkur by Solingen blade that came with my razor lasted weeks.  The Derbys just pull instead of cut.  I made the mistake of buying 100 of these things ...I guess you get what you pay for.  Even the Wilkinson or generic blades from Wal-Mart or Kroger are waaaay better than these things.  Stay away!</li>
            <li> The package came in perfect condition and no damage was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the blade, you get a very close shave with little to no irritation on the skin when doing a three shave pass. Recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These blades are super cheap and sharp!  100ct for like $8 is over 2 years worth of shaving for me!</li>
            <li> I have purchased those blades after reading reviews about it and it works awesome. Before Derby, I had purchased blades from Wallmart and tht were like 5 blades for $3 and this was like $10 for 100 which is great deal and works good, sharp and satusfied. Yes, they are not as Wallmart one but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Really now, how can they make such a precision product at under 8 cents a blade, sharpened, wrapped, packaged, and labeled? I&#x27;m preferring these over the Lord, Wilkinson, and Feather, in my Lord L6 handle, though all are pretty close.  These are the best buy of those, shave well, and hold an edge a while. My goal was to end the expensive cartridge blade purchases, and this has been a fine way to do that, along with the Van Der Hagen shave set. Bonus, these blades have a number on each edge, visible thru the bottom of the razor, so you can tell which edge you have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, though, that to get the super close shave that I like, with any setup, I have to use my free hand to feel for rough patches, reapply soap, pull the skin tight, and then work those areas in multiple directions/passes/wets.  I&#x27;ve found that to be the secret.  One simple pass with the grain just doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> very good blade.and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I like derby blades .. They are not my favorites but they give a good shave.. And for less than 8 cents .. You can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> Very thin blade, almost paper like. It&#x27;s ok. Cut me up a lot. Could just be me though. Good value if they work for you.</li>
            <li> I love these blades, with ceramic coating!!!</li>
            <li> Changing the blade twice a month means you will shave for 4 years for the price of one regular razor.  Take that Gillette!  I&#x27;m sure there are better quality blades out there, but I won&#x27;t know for another .. 3 years.  It did take my face some time to get used to safety blade shaving, but if you take your time you won&#x27;t cut yourself.  Just remember, safety shaving works best with two passes in opposite directions.  Soap up, shave one way, use the remaining lather on the brush and do another quick pass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to reccomend a DE blade to someone else as its such a personal decision. All blade are different as are all faces. The variables are endless and find the right combination is trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, these blades provide the smoothest shave with the least amount of irritation. They have a very smooth cutting edge compared to other blades( particularly the Merkur blade that has a sandpaper like edge) , thus the provide a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also very good on these blades. I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These work awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice shave. Forgiving, but tastes differ.</li>
            <li> Great price for blades, they are smooth.</li>
            <li> These are great blades for the money.  These last me about 3-6 months depending on how I use them and they cost about 1/8th of what it would cost to supply your fancy Gillette 6 blade razor or whatever it is.  Stop getting ripped off and go to either a straight-razor (my go-to but not in a rush) or a safety razor that takes these.  If you are paying $8+ for 4 cartridges of those &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors, you are absolutely being ripped off.  Make the switch and you will be amazed at how much money you are saving.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shave, not too sharp as to cut face up. Yet, provides smooth cut without dragging . I like the fact I am able to use blade for multiple days before I need to change it. Best blades on the market.</li>
            <li> buy these with a safety razor, and you will have long time supply of good blades; these come in individual plastic containers ( each with a small number of blades.) There is a place to dispose of used, but still sharp enough to do damage, blades in the plastic blade container, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about  injury.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN WALMART GREAT PRODUCT PRICED WRIGHT</li>
            <li> I really like the smooth, close shave I get with these blades.  In addition, I get more shaves per blade with the Derby&#x27;s than I do with some others I use.</li>
            <li> The blades shave well and last as long as one would expect.  I get six or eight shaves per blade by cleaning them off and flipping them over in the razor after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, this pack of blades will easily last a year; and if you use proper technique (wet-shaving with soap and brush, not with canned foam), you will get as close and comfortable a shave as with any multi-blade razor.  For those given to worrying about the environment or just wishing to live more simply, the method just described produces no non-recyclable waste.  It makes me wonder why more men don&#x27;t use safety razors, given how cheaply one can get his hands on blades like this.  The only less wasteful method is with a straight razor, but the learning curve is simply too steep for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to an antique store or go online and without too much trouble you can find gizmos which claim to re-sharpen your razor blade.  Perhaps razor blades were proportionally more expensive back in the 20s or 30s; perhaps, however, they never sold really well and were an old-fashioned version of the modern contraptions you see on midnight infomercials nowadays - things that sound like a good idea but when delivered don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  So it is with razor blade sharpeners.  I own one and it doesn&#x27;t extend the blade&#x27;s life appreciably - certainly not enough to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> These are a bit mis-leading, they’re not made in Sweden as they seemed to have said; impliying hi-tech/hi-end manufacturing.  Instead they’re made in Turkey, so are many of clothes.  These blades are okay, they’re better than The Shark brand that came with my razor though.</li>
            <li> These blades are an excellent value for the money. I bought them to replace the Dorco blades that came with my Micro Touch One and I really like them. In my opinion they honestly have a better edge than the Dorco blades and provide a better quality shave. I was able to get a much closer shave with these blades than the ones that came with the Micro Touch One. If you are looking for a great shave you can&#x27;t beat these for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price, these can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve tried 10 brands in a sample pack, and these were my favorites so I ordered 100.  Should last 2 years with almost weekly blade changes.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; blade.  I plan to use them up, but I won&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> These came with the razors Merkur and Jagger. Have only used one for 4 shaves and is excellent in both. Have Astras and Feathers coming so will compare.</li>
            <li> On the standard of one blade a week (you may use more or less I suppose), I figure I&#x27;ve got about two years of shaves for less than $15.00.  I can&#x27;t imagine beating that!  The quality seems good so far and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and purchased these after using up some Merkur blades. After shaving for 24 years, I&#x27;ve never had razor burn so bad, would not recommend these to a friend. Gave them two stars cause I&#x27;m nice and the price was good, will be returning them. Oh, and yes, I do know how to shave properly. :)</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have a thick beard and change the blade about once a month.  But I have gone two months without changing the blade and the blades still cut great.  At 100 count - this should last for many years.  It&#x27;s nice that some companies still make a quality affordable product.  Great job Derby!</li>
            <li> Great razors and the cost is even better.</li>
            <li> They cut well, wonder if the feather&#x27;s will be to much for my skin. I would buy these again though.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said this was a good deal but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I was trying to save money on blades but if I cut myself all the time what good is it.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to stick to the more expensive blades, at least I save on bandages.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a double bladed razor for my brother and as I looked for compatible razor blades, I decided to buy these. Upon arrival and use, they are excellent and have worked well for the first few shaves. With 100 blades total in 20 separate dispensers, they will be here for a long time. I like how simple the packaging and design of these blades are. There is Arabic printed along the box as an alternative language, which I am not used to, but it make sense since the blades are made all the way in Turkey. They feel sturdy and are sharp, which is exactly what I need in a razor. I do not see anything wrong with them, so I think they deserve 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> Great product and company!</li>
            <li> Good blades at a great price. Get 4-6 shaves per blade with no unwarranted nicks.</li>
            <li> Best DE razors out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Derby Extra for over a year now.  I initially receive them with 5 other brands in a sample blade package.  After testing several other more expensive brands, I found that inexpensive Derby was the best and longest lasting blade.  It doesn&#x27;t nick easily on the first shave like the sharpest, higher-end blades sometimes do, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dull quickly either.  I have a medium beard, not too heavy, I shave daily, and I lather and shave lightly 3 times each shaving session.  I get 5 or 6 days out of these.  I just purchased a 50 pack, so I&#x27;ll be shaving with Derby for the better part of the next year.</li>
            <li> These look good and function well in my merkur long handle. I have enough for well over a year with my shaving habits. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Not all are smooth and sharp.  Price is nice, but I may purchase a different brand when these are depleted.  Provides a good shave, but not a great one.</li>
            <li> Good - they&#x27;re good for 4-5 shaves before they start to tug.</li>
            <li> These and the Personna are the best DE blades that I have tried. You will get an excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the way it goes in the world of razor blades.  When you get a good one, these blades are a good as any I&#x27;ve tried, but a fair number have been off the mark - dull, uneven, etc.  And I have about 90 blades left to go.</li>
            <li> This was a terrific deal ,very economic. A great alternate to the very expensive disposable blades most guys buy. My husband thinks they are great.</li>
            <li> Derby blades seem to be of decent quality, and for someone with a lighter beard than mine I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work fine.  However, with my coarse hair, they just chew me up.  I mostly bought the 100 count because 100 Derby blades cost me a bit under $8...I figured if I couldn&#x27;t use them I&#x27;d hand them off to friends (which is exactly what I&#x27;ve done).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were okay for some areas of my face, but I&#x27;d get an average of 3-5 cuts per pass in my trouble areas...that adds up pretty quickly.  However, I could never really get that BBS shave with a Derby (seriously, I could go six passes and still be scratchy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all things shaving, YMMV, so you probably don&#x27;t want to make the rookie move I did and purchase 100 of these guys unless you know they&#x27;re good for your face.  I know plenty of people get great shaves with these blades--I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
            <li> Brought these not realizing that this is essentially a 2 years supply of blades. Fortunately they seem to work really well for my lower neck which had real problems with my old disposable and also with some merkur blades  I received with my merkur razor.</li>
            <li> These work. Not the sharpest out there (Feather are shaper) but are so inexpensive you&#x27;ll find yourself using these for all sorts of stuff--scraping windows, etc. Basically you get a decades worth for less than $10. If I were P&amp;G I would do whatever I could to stop people from finding out about Double edged safety razors. I will never buy some Gillette or Shick thing for 100x the cost again.</li>
            <li> These are the better of the blades I ordered and I get a really good even shave and I am not a slave the the big manufacturers of todats over priced blades.</li>
            <li> Product is good, cheap compared to big name twin, three or four blades razors.  Use once and throw away! It does it&#x27;s job.  It can be irritating if you do not know how to use it.  First use Olive oil after taking shower, massage it good, then take quality foam or Shaving cream and brush.  Prepare shave to make it soft and raised.  This blade will do wonders without any cuts.</li>
            <li> They work and are inexpensive.  I have no problem stocking up on these in the future.  I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for sure.</li>
            <li> My beard is too tough for these blades.  My son who is starting to shave its perfect for him.  I settled for the blue personna and change blade once per week.</li>
            <li> 100 blades at that price? Yes please. These blades do the trick for my hyper sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never had such a wonderful leg shave! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and loved the combination. As I am using double edge safety razor for the first time, I found the razor is mild and a second pass against the grain will give a smooth shave. This combination is a great for beginners but always shave slowly, let the weight of DE89Lbl do the work and in short stroke. Practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> they are good like they say.</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with an Edwin jagger de89lbl and Taylor of old bond street sandlewood shaving cream they are very sharp and get the job done right. I am new to double edge saftey razor shaving and so far it has been a blast shaving ! Before shaving with expensive Mach 3 razors which would leave my face red and burned ! It seemed as if those Mach 3&#x27;s were getting less sharp and more expensive! So I read up on  double edge saftey razors and the edwin jagger and derby razors are a great combo for me ! Better cheaper way to shave !!</li>
            <li> I got tired of having razors burns AND spending 30 a month to gillette. Switched to single razor and now i shave every day no razor burn plus so much cheaper. :) Face is happy pocket is happy</li>
            <li> Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person. Personally, these blades do not work for me, but that is no fault of the blades. They are not designed for my facial hair. The blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, all contained in a box, and if my beard was a bit softer, they would be an absolute steal of a deal. Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack in order to try out a few different types. If that sampler tells you that the Derbys are your blade of choice, then by all means purchase this item. You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> cut my fingers getting blade out of the package and have 10 packs to work with ......and only 2 shaves per blade....</li>
            <li> First box of razors I&#x27;ve purchased for traditional shaving so I can&#x27;t compare it to others but...after 3-4 shaves I find I have to change razors. Maybe that is the norm and even so it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;second&#x27; best double edge blade.  The feathers are slightly sharper and possibly shave a little closer.  The Derby are still excellent and the price is great.</li>
            <li> They work perfect in my Edwin Jagger DE89. I love my shaves and I have a pack to last me for the entire year, and then some.</li>
            <li> Though Astra, Crystal, Wilkinson, and US Personna are my top choices, the Derby is more than adequate, and considering price, tends toward the excellent category.</li>
            <li> I like these blades, after trying different brands ( I recommend doing if just learning to use a safety razor ) I find these to be sharp enough to give a close shave on a daily basis but not irritating after 2 separate passes in the morning.  I found they are not as sharp as &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades.  I have a thinner beard growth but require a clean shave for work, these work well for me.</li>
            <li> Better buying these then the 2 pack for nearly the same price and only 10 blades.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Less than a dime per  blade,  blade lasts at least 7 days.  Best shave is just after hot shower, but I soap up and shave 5 days of the week and get a great shave.  Use a hot soap cup and badger brush for optimum shave.</li>
            <li> Consistent shave and affordable.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite safety razor blades.  I bought the multi pack and this seemed to be the best fit for my face.  They are sharp and leave less razor burn than the other brands.</li>
            <li> fit the razor I bought. Gives a nice smooth shave on the legs.</li>
            <li> A great value. If you&#x27;re on the fence about double-edge safety razors, don&#x27;t be. You&#x27;ll save a ton vs. cartridges. 100 blades for 9 bucks, it&#x27;s a no-brainer. Now go pick your favorite razor and get started!</li>
            <li> Good close shave and dirt cheap</li>
            <li> Each razor lasts about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this razor and it works great in my double edge safety razor from Edwin jagger. I shave everyday for work and love the feel of my smooth face afterwards. Even my wife loves rubbing her hands on my face now. After about 5 uses I grab a clean razor but I have 100 of them so I am good for quite awhile. Overall this is a great product. The price of 100 is so much cheaper than the Mach III that I was suing before along with giving me no razor burns.</li>
            <li> ok- so i bought these for my husbands Ambroley Razor (which he loves) but found my own use for them as well- they are super flexible and were great to take a mark from painters tape off of a mirror in my house. yeah, so my husband says they are great for the razor, and we both agree that they save a lot of waste (think: no disposable cartridges with all the plastic packaging that comes along with the)... but let&#x27;s be honest, i am most excited about the mirror and how i can use these flexible things to clean other smooth surfaces if needed.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Your results may vary, especially with DE razor blades, but I&#x27;ve found these to be a terrific value for a blade that works for just about anyone.  Many people rave about the Feather blades, but I cannot comment because I have not tried them, however, for about 10 cents a blade you&#x27;ll get a very forgiving blade with the Derby.  I&#x27;ve found that the Derby&#x27;s work best for me when I shave no less than every other day.  They seem to bog down in longer whiskers...an area where Merkur blades seem to suit me better.  The Derby&#x27;s last me about 3 or 4 shaves, and I shave every other day.  At 1 blade a week and 52 blades a year, that&#x27;s a 2 year supply for $10.  Can you beat that?  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic blades. They are extremely sharp, last a long time, and the price for the quantity can&#x27;t really be beat!</li>
            <li> Good blades at a great price.  It took me forever to convince my husband to give a safety razor a try but once he did he has never gone back.  With the prices of 3, 4, and 5 blade replacement cartridges going higher all the time it is wonderful to find this inexpensive yet very efficient alternative.  These are his favorite blades and buying in bulk makes them super affordable.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  The fact is they are disposable. You only need them to do the job well, which they do.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for the beginner and can be carried on to a &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; for most other shavers. This blade will cut smoothly on a beard of medium thickness or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver is able to make several passes over the same areas with minimal to zero irritation. Even against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp, and smooth. Some blades are sharp, some are smooth, this is a fine combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;- Newbie lathers&#x27; can hone their shaving soap skills while using this blade. It&#x27;s very forgiving on those who&#x27;ve not yet mastered the art of building a good lather for slip.&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll get a more relaxing shave as you&#x27;re not typically anxious about cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;- Cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- May not be sharp enough for those with a thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;- Blade life is minimal. Two shaves tops for me as the blades fails to keep a good cutting edge because multiple passes are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars for all the right reasons. If you&#x27;re the type of gent that likes to enjoy his shave, relax and take his time getting that baby-smooth feeling minus the drawbacks of irritating razor burn or unsightly nicks... then this is the blade for you. A nice new blade for every shave will leave you feeling like a million bucks after every shower.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to purchase expensive 5-blade razor replacements. This amount of blades will last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been said about these blades? They are meant for the casual shaver who probably shaves every 4-5 days or less; which is what i fall under. Those with thick, full bears might want to trim first or just get a different blade altogether. Great for those who have sensitive skin and get irritated easy. They may not be the sharpest blades out there but believe you me, these blades can still cut you if not careful! I find it great that it&#x27;s not too sharp as it allows you to perform a 3 pass shave no problem with some good lather to get a real close shave. Best of all, these blades are dirt cheap and will save you a ton of money!!</li>
            <li> These and Astra&#x27;s are the only ones that don&#x27;t scratch up my face. These are a bit gentler on my opinion.</li>
            <li> Really good blades for the price and very forgiving</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for the past 10 years or so. I decided to go back to wet shaving. I have used this blade for only two shaves so far. It was a wonderful, smooth shave. I could not tell any difference between shaves. I hope to get 5 shaves, stay tuned.      Update: I used the same blade for five great shaves. I decided to change blades because for .02 cents a shave why push it. I am 75 yo and since I bought a 100 pack I may have bought a lifetime supply, can&#x27;t wait for my next shave. (I don&#x27;t shave every day)</li>
            <li> did you received product.</li>
            <li> This 100 pack of blades is such a bargain. I would like to say if the blades themselves are better or worse than others. I have read other reviews of assorted blades and it seems each handle/blade combination works differently with each unique beard. I can say I have been using Derby Blades for a month and I have yet to cut myself. It&#x27;s also  the best shave I have ever had. My father complemented me on my clean shave the other day. I can&#x27;t say if that has ever happened before. Each blade lasts me about five shaves before they drag at all.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my boyfriend who has used a safety razor all of his life..he cannot believe the cost for so many blades!! Has enough for years to come and at such a low price. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> insanely cheap!,great shave!</li>
            <li> Using Derby blades with a Shaving Factory safety razor I was critical of the blades.  I then purchased a Merkur 34C HD and removed the blade from the old razor and put it into the Merkur, what a difference.  Three shaves from the same blade that appeared dull when used in the Shaving Factory safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of a safety razor seemed to have made the difference</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Standard in our house for our shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my husbands shaver and great price</li>
            <li> These were the blades that were included with my Edwin Jagger razor.  I have tried a couple other blades and went back to these.  They give me a decent shave without nicking or irritation.  They are sharp, but not too aggressive.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really need more history with these, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was shipped an entire box of reject blades, for I&#x27;m not quite sure how they can all be so terrible when the rest of the reviews here are favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the \\&quot;good\\&quot; blades I pull out I can get about 1 shave off of it before it takes on the shaving qualities of a broken bottle. I look like just survived an assassination attempt when I try to shave with the same blade more than once. I&#x27;ll even go as lightly as I possibly can, and I&#x27;ll still end up with a myriad of cuts. Prior to this I had been using Merkur blades, and have never had an issue with them, but $7 for 100 blades? how can I pass up a deal like that? Let me tell you, even at that these blades are over priced for the quality of shave they give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to merkur, and putting these blades in storage in case I need something to slit my throat with one day.</li>
            <li> Having recently come to DE shaving, I ordered a starter pack with a bunch of different blades; I tried Persona, Feather, Murkur, and Derby. I gave each blade a 2-3 day trial and found that for me, the feather was simply too sharp. I had the worst razor burn. I walked around with my neck on fire. I guess my face and neck are more sensitive than other guys.  That is fine, we are all unique.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Derby blades to give a great, close shave. I look and feel great. The fact that I can order them 100 at a time is even better. That is over years&#x27; worth of blades in one shot. Also, with the value you get for price, if you get a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; blade you really do not care, since each blades is costing you somewhere in the 25 cents range.&lt;br /&gt;Look, these blades work and will not rip your face off, seems like an easy choice.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for $8?  This is an amazing value.  One box lasts me and my girlfriend (she steals the razor to shave her legs) a year and half.  I just ordered my second box.</li>
            <li> I ordered 100 derby blades about a year ago. i try to use each blade as long as possible. These blades are good for shaving against the grain which i prefer for the closer shave. i get 2-3 weeks out of a blade with daily use. towards the end of a blades life i switch to with the grain shaving for less irritation.  i love these blades a lot and would recommend them to anybody. i seriously think i have 4-5 years of blades though. 8 BUCKS!!!!!  how much is 5 years of mach 3 blades worth? and like a previous commenter stated, i may go out and buy a nice bottle of scotch after writing this with all the money i am saving.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional bargain for those of us who use a double edge razor.  Works out to 9 or 10 cents per blade, and even if you only get one shave out the blade, that is still cheap.  But, if you get 3 to 5 shaves out of a blade, well then, that makes the bargain even better.  I for one normally get at least 4 shaves out of one blade, and even then I could probably get two more if I wanted.  It really feels good to walk by box store displays of three or four blades for twelve or thirteen bucks of &#x27;safety razor&#x27; blades. Granted, using the old fashion double edged razor is not every ones cup of tea, but if your willing to put a wee effort into your morning shave, these blades are certainly a good value.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best FOR ME and for the price it makes it even better. Not only do I get a close shave but its inexpensive. I have seen some reviews talk about how thse blades dont last long, but they forget that they 100 blades for 7 bucks and change!</li>
            <li> I have been using my razor for about 2 weeks, I used one blade for about 2 weeks now and still have the one, they might be cheap but they sure last long, I shave every day, and my hair is thick, totally recommend this blades...</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME! They stay sharp for a really long time compared to similar blades, and the price is unbeatable. 100 razors is kind of a lot, but they don&#x27;t expire, and I&#x27;ll need them for many years to come. Good investment.</li>
            <li> the derby blades out perform themselves. get about 4 to 5 shaves out of one blade. very satisfed with them equal to if not exceeding  wilkinson&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like these blades very much.  For me they are a step below a Feather but nonetheless an excellent blade for me.  They seem to last longer than the Feather as well.</li>
            <li> I switched from high priced razors to a safety razor. I can&#x27;t argue with spending $10.00 for a 100 blades verses the alternative. No complaints from me on this purchase.</li>
            <li> These blades were not as good as Feather, Wilkinson and other brands! Will not be buying more!</li>
            <li> Not for me, even a fresh blade felt like it was pulling out hairs and not cutting them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Very sharp, great price. I can change my blade one per week and not have to reorder for almost two years. Such a deal.</li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp enough even for one time use. Getting a lot of razor burn.</li>
            <li> Awesome razors, there sharp and have no defects</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to DE shaving so I bought these razors based on the reviews of others and some reviews I found on some forums. I figured they would be basic mediocre blades that I could use when I was just needing a touch up shave. However after shaving with Feathers for a couple of weeks and switching to the Derby&#x27;s last week I can say for sure that these blades are just as good for me as the Feathers are (with the added bonus of being even less expensive!) Others may not like them but they worked for me.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites! why else would I buy 100 of them? Good price too!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> These razors are great for the price.  They do not irritate the skin one bit and gave me a way better shave than any disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I like these Derby blades and Persona &amp;#34;lab blues&amp;#34;. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong try them and if for some odd reason they aren&#x27;t right for you they will make a great PIF.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent price and it works better than the Merkur blade for my coarse hair. I shave my face and head daily and it did not tug or pull like the Merkur blade.  I like the cost, and have no dislikes.  I would definitely recommend this as a first blade to use for the first timer like me.  The blades are not made in Russia, Greece, or Germany which are the most consistent quality wise by reputation.  They are made in Sweden and I&#x27;m satisfied.  BTW, I;m using the Merkur Long Handle and it works great with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor.  The Derby blades hold a sharp edge for a week for me, but I only shave every other day, and have a thin beard. When shaving my face, I get a very close, smooth shave. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I seem to always have razor stuble on my neck under my jaw line. This may be due to my technique though. The cost of the blades alone is a good reason to try them out to seeif you like them.</li>
            <li> I use these as every day razors. I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;I dont get nicks and cuts when using derby.</li>
            <li> Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tbone</li>
            <li> Excellent product....super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The choice of blades is quite subjective, and I see that the Derby works well for some. But in my experience, they seem less sharp initially than other blades. Two or three shaves seems about the maximum rather than five or six (or more) with Astra, Merkur, Feather, etc. For blades in quantity, I still lean toward the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and really really sharp. Be careful. OUCH! Actually there is no ouch. These blades are so sharp I didn&#x27;t feel it when I nicked myself. LOL. The blades are slightly thicker than tissue paper. This is taking some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Sharp and cut good. They last on me about 8-10 shaves before going bad. I have a 4 beard toughness on scale of 1-10&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Nice blades , good for the price  !</li>
            <li> Love this blade new to the DE community and is only the 2nd I&#x27;ve tried next to shark super chrome. Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> After I figured out how to shave properly with a double-edged razor, nicks with these blades are few and far between. The best part is that these are so cheap you can shave forever and hardly spend anything.</li>
            <li> I bought my last box in 2008. These razors stay sharp for a long time. Great value at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very good buy.  Bought these for my husband and his new double edge razor. Smooth shave very little nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> These are a great shave, they do not nick like some other safety blades I&#x27;ve used recently.  They are a great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> this product works as intended and is easily one of the best blades on the market at this time. At this time it is great that there is another option than the cartridge style razors that are so popular with the kids.  they will learn with experience.</li>
            <li> I loved the price these Derby blades sold for, but upon arrival, I pulled one out and attempted to shave. I felt a lot of tugging and very little hair removal. I&#x27;d initially started with the Feather blades, but they are significantly more expensive than the Derby blades and I learned why. If you have softer facial hair, these may work for you. But, if you have a difficult time getting a close shave with an electric, this won&#x27;t do any better. I&#x27;ve given in and now pay the extra for the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for about 4 years in a \\&quot;top-load\\&quot; safety razor.....replacing the Mach 3 type that I had used previously. This gives an equally, if not closer shave, at a fraction of the cost.  I have a relatively thick beard and change the blade about once every 5-7 days.  Do yourself a favor and start using them; you too will be a convert.  Go buy a nice bottle of scotch with the $ you save.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get use tho these again (after Gillette and Schick). But I am happy I did go back, Blades are good for a few shaves. After 3 or 4 they start to lose that sharpness (I have tough hair).</li>
            <li> Great value. If you are buying derby blades remember they are one of the less aggressive blades available, so if you have a thick beard, consider a different blade or buy a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor blade. Each blade lasts several shaves, and each side is numbered allowing up to four different edges for cutting (two on each side if you flip the blade over in the razor). When buying in this kind of bulk, you will have enough blades for a long time, and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These blades are nice, especially for someone new to a safety razor. They don&#x27;t hack away at your face and my goodness are they cheap. So wonderfully cheap!</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, the choice of double edged razors is pretty personal - all I can say is that these work just great for me. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks now and they produce a close shave with little or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 or 5 days with the same razor, I start to notice that I need more passes to get a close shave so plan to swap them out every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> Very nice and great price. Helps reduce irritation to my husbands face.</li>
            <li> These blades do not disappoint and the price is right for 100.  Keeping your blade cost below $0.10 per blade is fantastic.  Better than $35-$40 for 8 cartridges and the shave is much better to boot</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price!  These blades give a good shave!  What&#x27;s nice is that each blade come individually wrapped in bandaid style wrapping paper.  They&#x27;re wrapped safe and they shouldn&#x27;t rust out while they&#x27;re wrapped.</li>
            <li> I am a couple packs in and still like these. I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but as long as you keep the blade &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t let it get dull, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Shaving with these straight razor&#x27;s gives a smooth close shave.  Feels good for me and the ladies like it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razor blades.  Lord, Feather (ouch), etc.  These  razors are just right.  I&#x27;d say between Shark and Feather razor blades.  If you have any doubts, do what I did and try a mixed sampler pack.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different...</li>
            <li> These are my second favoriate blades (Feathers are the 1st), but for the price you can change blades after every shave if you want.  I normally get 3-4 days out of each blade.  Good all round blade for someone just starting out on DE shaving, but order a sample pack with different blades to try before you order 100 blades.</li>
            <li> they get the job done, and i love the nifty plastic blade holders that you can also dispose of your used blades in. i&#x27;ll try a different brand after i run out of these and then update my review.</li>
            <li> I got these blades at the same time as I got some Personna blades.  I rate these as somewhat better than Personnas.</li>
            <li> At this price, I can pretend I am a millionaire and use a new blade with each shave!  I am a twice a week shaver (retired) and get 4 shaves a blade.  At that rate, I won&#x27;t be buying blades for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back!  Safety razors are way better and 1000x cheaper to utilize than those Fusion or Mach products on store shelves, do not waste your money... get a safety razor and some derby&#x27;s! :) Will definitely purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> After doing a side by side comparison with Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Platinums, I determined that these Derby blades were not good for me. In fact, they were terrible. But with anything else that is shaving related, your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really these blades aren&#x27;t very high quality. They pulled and tugged at my beard. So in essence they aren&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my razor or these blades, but while one side gives a nice shave the other side sits too far off the face. Although, can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
            <li> These blades were not sharp enough to give me a close shave without irritation. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, but the razors that came with my razor did a better job.</li>
            <li> Double edge blades are no longer available in local drug stores.  I use them in a hair trimming device and I now have a supply for many years.</li>
            <li> Really great blades, not too aggressive, but more than enough to give you a close, relatively nick free shave.  I like these much better than Shark or other blades I have tried.  The package size is great, as soon as a blade starts to lose it&#x27;s edge I chuck it.  Shaving with a safety razor is much better if you are using a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> Easy blades to begin shaving with. I use these when I&#x27;m rushed and need a very forgiving blade. It feels like you can&#x27;t really mess up with this blade; within reason, of course, and you should be familiar with double-edge razor shaving before getting cocky. Of course, the flip side is that they won&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as some more aggressive blades, but a &amp;#34;closer shave&amp;#34; will look like this one in a few hours anyway, so it isn&#x27;t the biggest deal.</li>
            <li> great cost and quality.  My husband will not have to buy razors for the next year at least.  Saves so much money.</li>
            <li> they are good what you pay, Much better than expensive disposable  razors.</li>
            <li> Very dull out of the box, poor quality blade alignment on about 1 of 5 blades, never have this problem with other blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son after having used them for about 2 years myself.  They are not the sharpest blade I have encountered but give a very smooth shave with little or no irritation.  They are especially good for newcomers to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Although not the sharpest blades I have tried in my short limited experience, it is not at all bad. I have a baby face so blades last me about a week. I like that the cutting surfaces are numbered. This should help me keep track of each blade&#x27;s use and maximize life. With that said, this stick of 100 will last me a couple of years for the cost of two premium multi-blade cartridges that will last me at most two weeks. I figured my wife would give me grief over a new &amp;#34;hobby&amp;#34; but she loves the economy and the fact that these shave me closer than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> They are super cheap and shave well.  I will def be buying again so no worries.  Sharp, Cheap, Fantastic, and get it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat $.08 cents a razor, and this gives really close shaves!  Remarkable closeness for the money. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Used this brand before, always gives a nice smooth cut. I use one side per shave, so each blade &#x3D; 2 days/2 shaves. A 100 pack will last for at least a year in my hands. Compare the price of these to a normal replaceable blade schick or gillette for the same amount of time! Plus since I dont re-use the blades, my face doesnt break out as much.</li>
            <li> You may have to try blades from different makers to find one that&#x27;s right for your face - these are right for me. They are sharp and relatively long-lasting. I find that my wet-shaving experience is best when I use a little baby oil before lathering up, much less irritation. Get a trial pack, give these a whirl, and see if you like them.</li>
            <li> they are not dull, but the packaging is overly conservative on the part of safety. the box contains mini-boxes of five razors, each razor wrapped in its own paper envelope and then again with wax paper held by some kind of tacky stuff. takes some patience to get a shave if you do not prep by unboxing and unboxing and doing at least one more unwrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, they work. I dislike handling the electronic shavers, as the blades go bad in a year and it costs as much as another shaver to get them replaced.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp. For the price I paid you can&#x27;t go wrong. Every blade is packaged separately and wrapper can be used to dispose old blade. Good buy.</li>
            <li> You must have a device to achieve your desire.  Individually the blades are floppy and difficult to use.  I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A great price on these and each blade tends to last 3-5 days for me.  I have very course hair so others might get better life out of them.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack of various manufacturers several months ago to try in my 60&#x27;s Super Speed. Of all of them, I chose the Derby blades. They stayed sharp with the best in the bunch, but weren&#x27;t overly aggressive in my razor. Of course, you&#x27;ll need to try various blades if you have a different razor than me, but this is a great combination in my experience. Close shave, little to no irritation, and a great value when buying 100 pack.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending too much money on cartridges that lasted only a few shaves. Having converted to safety razor shaving I decided to give these blades a try after reading several reviews, and happy to say I was not disappointed. I feel these blades give not only a close shave but a comfortable one as well. I&#x27;m actually using these on my face as well as my head and they perform admirably in both areas.  I actually find that I&#x27;m able to go against the grain on my scalp; something that I could not do with most razors, including the one that came with my Merkur safety razor thus resulting in a much shinier dome.  And combined with the price I paid for these, win win.</li>
            <li> this is a very dull blade was not as smooth clean cut as i thought but it is the cheapest</li>
            <li> although the blades have varied in edge sharpness, i have luckily been able to find more of my shaves comfortable--some new blades have varied in their edge. however, factors such as pre-shave prep might have also contributed to my discomfort. generally an awesome blade for the price of purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these razors with my Edward Jagger razor. It is safe to say I have a pretty thick bear, and even after a few days of not shaving at all, these razors &#x27;wipe&#x27; the hair off very easily. For around $7.50, I get 200 clean shaves. I always use each side of the razor only once per shave and then dispose of that. Still, that&#x27;s a nice smooth clean 200 shaves for $7.50. I don&#x27;t think you will find any better value. I know there are other more expensive blades, but unless Derby start lowering there quality, I will stick with them as I have had no problems thus far. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I hate the turks but they make a great blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased the blades to be used with my Feather Double-Edge Razor by Jatai. I have a very thick, and fast growing beard.  Up til now the only time i have ever had a baby smooth shave was at the barber. Now using this blade/razor combo I am baby smooth nearly all day, which is something I rarely ever experienced before.  So not only is this a heck of a lot cheaper than cartridge shaving, but I get a lot closer, and better shave without all the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy shaving now</li>
            <li> I went back to a double edge razor and a good brush, shaving mug and Mama Bear brand soaps about a year and a half ago. I have tried several competing blade brands as samples and as gifts. I have used a 100 Derby blade pack in the last year and always return to them. The order came immediately and the price is next to nothing especially given what &amp;#34;modern blade cartridges&amp;#34; cost for even a three months supply. I usually get a couple good shaves out of each one as I do with any double edge blades. There was a time when I thought all blades should last forever, then found good shaving takes good blades. Shaving and blades are a personal thing, based on a person&#x27;s shaving technique, the quality of the lather and the beard preparation. These last two being as important for me as the blades. I have friends who don&#x27;t spent time with beard prep and/or have not mastered making a good lather with a brush and some have returned to canned shaving cream. I have not, I like Derby blades and I like this vendor.</li>
            <li> These blades did not work for me way to much drag and pull. Tried the Wilkinson classic made in Germany, much sharper and much more comfortable shave than the Derby.</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.Only on my first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried six or so different brands.  Some are very aggressive and some are very relaxed.  Derby seems very middle of the road and left me with a good shave without the occasional nick.</li>
            <li> Prefer Feather but these are a very close (pun intended) second...</li>
            <li> This was just as it was posted. It is a good deal, an I recommend  it to get.  SW</li>
            <li> I just decided to go retro and buy a double edge razor. I purchased a Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; 42C razor and it was highly rated. But the Feather blades I also heard rave reviews about would take over a month to arrive, so I purchased a 100 pack if these Derby blades. So, after 45 years since using double edge blades, I have nothing to compare the Derbys against. They do an adequate job of shaving, but after about three days of usage, they seem to miss a lot of spots.. they&#x27;re certainly inexpensive enough to replace every three days - but I&#x27;m used to multi-blade cartridges that last for WEEKS, not days... at roughly a dime a piece, they cost about the same as my Harry&#x27;s cartridges which easily last me two months. But the Harry&#x27;s cartridges give me a better shave and don&#x27;t take a sample of my A+ blood, no matter how closely I shave.</li>
            <li> I use to think the red Personna and the lab blue Personna DE razor blades were the best for my sensitive skin, but these Derby Extra DE blades are far superior, and make the Personna&#x27;s feel rough. They are very sharp but smooth and forgiving at the same time. I can get a comfortable shave that is close and nick free.</li>
            <li> The thing about DE shaving is that there are no \\&quot;universally good\\&quot; products.  What works well for one person may work poorly for another.  That is why it is so important to try different blades, aftershaves, etc. until you find what works for YOUR face. I have found Derby blades to work well for me, in combination with my Edwin Jagger De89bl razor.  I have a heavy beard and find I can get 3-4 three pass shaves from a Derby, without a lot of tugging, nicks, etc.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and plentiful. They come in individual packages of five, which is nice when traveling. I would suggest this to others looking to complete their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> How anyone could buy the 18-bladed, liquid-coated, swivel-ball razors is a mystery to me. Changing the blade once a month, this&#x27;ll last ten years. Can I get a woop woop?</li>
            <li> I suppose that there are better blades out there -- but these are very good indeed -- consistently good --and at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are just as good as the ones you would purchase from any store. They are inexpensive, and the shipping was not very much. If you have a razor like the old time ones you will love these</li>
            <li> These are very good razor blades,they give a  close shave,last for several shaves and also they are a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have a medium coarse beard and sensitive skin. These blades worked a treat for me.  I usually get 3-4 uses out of each blade as I only use them to spot shave around my beard several times per week. However at this price it should still save me a ton of money vs disposables.</li>
            <li> Those of you that are new at wetshaving or shaving with a safety razor must know that blades work differently for everyone.  You may have run across the acrostic YMMV - Your Mileage May Vary and it will.  I have a pretty heavy beard and I found these initially to do the job well.  They don&#x27;t irritate my face, but they don&#x27;t give me the best shaving experience during the shave.  I think it is a good product and well worth trying.  I have a friend who has a heavy beard like me that swears by this brand, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> As with all blades YMMV. I have to shave in 4 different directions for my hair. This requires 4 passes with each pass skipping certain areas. This means each area gets 2 passes and a touch up. I get no weepers and no irritation when I do my part.</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ll keep using these as long as I can get my hands on them.  Great value and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;, if you consider the lack of landfill impact.</li>
            <li> Gives me an excellent close &amp; smooth shave, the best that I have had in years.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the blades are the best I&#x27;ve used. These 100 blades should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  Nothing gets a closer shave for my face than a brand new Derby Extra.  I switched to a safety razor a few months ago and I&#x27;ve tried a couple different brands.  A friend recommended this one to me and now I&#x27;m committed to it.  Just bought a hundred (that&#x27;s about two years worth for me).</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I was happy with how it worked in my shave routine. If your looking to get into straight razor shaving (which uses double edge safety blades) or safety razor shaving this is recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in DE shaving. I bought a Feather DE razor on Amazon,which is an excellent DE razor. However the Feather blades that came with it are too sharp for me,many nicks. I bought 100 Derby blades on Amazon after trying a few in my Feather razor. They are a little less sharp than Feather blades but are sharp enough. No nicks, no fear of using these Derby blades. Try them and if you like them buy them in bulk from Amazon.They should last a long time at these give away prices.</li>
            <li> My being retired I dont shave every day so since purchase I have only used two blades. I dont know how many sha0ves I will get from a blade but am sure more than what I got fro those blue plastic two blade razors. As I recall, they cost about 30 cents each while a Derby blade costs about 9 cents each. The plastic razors  would gum up between the two blades. I would recomend the Derby  blades with any razor purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur Model 180 along with these blades, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to need anymore for a long long time.  Big money saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for</li>
            <li> 10-2016 Update: These have become one of my 2 favorite blades. I have really grown to appreciate what a smooth shave I get with these Derby blades. A close comfortable shave with 2 passes and no irritation at all. A real winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;A good blade for the money. I like the Derby blade in most of my double edge razors. Sure there are sharper blades out there but it is what works for you when it comes to blades. I like them best in my more aggressive razors but they work fine in the milder ones also. I have found the quality and consistency very good. I use them in my rotation.</li>
            <li> 10 of these blades came with the Utopia Care Long handle Safety Razor that I ordered on Amazon. Have received great, comfortable shaves with these blades. So I ordered this 100 pack.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he says it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like the Derby extra razor blade.  It provides a nice smooth shave.  Worth buying in the 100 box. These work well with my EJ de89 bl.</li>
            <li> These are the first blades I have bought for my DE Razor.  They shave just fine, no issues at all using them with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I felt compelled.  These are AWFUL.  Shaving with a steak knife would be a better option.  My skin is torn, and the stubble remains.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and purchase higher quality blades.</li>
            <li> This blade I&#x27;ve learned is all I personally need to get a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;As a recent convert to DE shaving, I&#x27;ve tried several different blades,&lt;br /&gt;usually more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the more pricey blades may have a keener edge,&lt;br /&gt;unless one has a simply &#x27;barbaric&#x27; beard, they are not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;If I can get 4-6 &#x27;no-nick&#x27; shaves from this blade, why spend more for a blade&lt;br /&gt;that gets slightly closer, more nicks, with 8-10 shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Derby blades work in Turkey, (where beards are fierce), why won&#x27;t they work well&lt;br /&gt;for a Scandinavian beard like mine?</li>
            <li> I tried several different blades, including but not limited to Astra, Wilkinson sword, Feather and 2 off brands. Over all i was most satisfied with these blades for a good smooth shave, over all the most bang for the buck that i have tried.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp and you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out! This is an awesome deal and you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind changing the blade every few shaves, these work just fine. But after that they get pretty dull. I guess not terrible for the price though.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for several weeks now and they work nicely. I will typically change the blade out weekly and they perform well for the duration. Have used Wilkinson Sword in the past and these blade are not as sharp, however the trade off is that I can be more agressive when shaving.</li>
            <li> Have semi coarse beard and these give me a great shave. I would definitely recommend them to at least try.</li>
            <li> I ordered these when I started DE shaving and they were okay but seems not as sharp as they could be. They are not dull, but the Astra blades I bought were much nicer.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. These aren&#x27;t my favorite blades because I prefer a very sharp one, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! I recommend using these in a relatively aggressive razor to compensate for their medium-sharpness. Everyone has a different experience wet shaving, this was mine.</li>
            <li> I bought a $2 double edged razor (from China). ...and these double edged blades. I don&#x27;t recon I need to buy any more blades for a year. OK. update. It has now been 3 years and I still have 19 blades left.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain.  Straight edges with no Burrs.  But since I have 100, I shave once using two edges and then dispose.</li>
            <li> These blades are not too aggressive but gives me a close shave. I typically do not grow a thick beard but I do get stubble every 2 days so by the third day I have to shave. I say this because every man&#x27;s face is different so your choice of blades will be different as well. Derby gives me the perfect balance. If you are new to wet shaving then you may want to start with these blades. I spent about $10 on this pack of 100 blades back in August 2012. It is now October 2014 and I&#x27;m still not half way through this pack. I use the same blade only 2x-3x then I throw it away. I save a lot of money the only premium purchase you will make is your shave soap. If you want to start wetshaving send me a message and I can set you up with a starter set. Initial cost would be maybe $60 but that is cheap compared to what you spend on Mach 3&#x27;s. I</li>
            <li> I love these blades, look forward to shaving now with my new shaver !  I do not think you can get a better deal out there anywhere ! Have been using these blades since December, great shave, I have a very thick coarse beard, and these cut clean ! I do multiple passes in different directions which you must do to get a good shave, these blades allow you to do this without any skin irritation. For the price you can not do better,</li>
            <li> Yes, I rate in 5 stars the product above.&lt;br /&gt;I liked very much the product, it is easy and efficient for use.</li>
            <li> My husband will not have to worry about ever having to find these in the store or if they ever qit making them.</li>
            <li> If you need DE blades and want a lot of high quality blades for a little amount of cash - this is your ONLY bet. 100 genuine Derby blades for around $20! That&#x27;s at least a year&#x27;s worth of blades. How much would someone spend on Mach III cartridges in the course of a year?</li>
            <li> Very good blades that work well in my safety razor. I get about 3 shaves per blade so their sharpness is pretty good and combine that with the overall price and I can&#x27;t find better blades for the money.</li>
            <li> Good blades, plus the price for a 100 of these! Good box size and I&#x27;m really impressed. I will look to buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay sharp longer than a few uses save your money buy a good electric razor. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as a Gillette double edged safety razor blade, but is certainly as sharp, and provides a very close shave.  What else can one ask for less than $10.00?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive razors, but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very good blades,will order more.</li>
            <li> My husband says these razor blades work great, and it looks like they do, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to get a clean shave on him, and each blade seems to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says he highly recommends them to anyone who uses double edge razors!</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving yet very forgiving.</li>
            <li> Derby has been my go-to blade for a long time. I find them the right balance of smoothness and effectiveness -- and at the right price. But I recently bought the 100 pack from this site, and I was shocked and disappointed. Of course, I haven&#x27;t tested all 100 of them, but all of the nine or ten I have tried so far have been defective. It is probably enough to conclude that I got a rotten batch. One of the edges is completely fine, but the other is rough and chafing. How can a company that makes such a fine product have such poor quality control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This experience has inspired me to buy a variety pack and see if I can find an even better alternative.</li>
            <li> They give these blades away in razors because they&#x27;re cheap.  They freaking suck though, just ask Shave Busta or any other major youtube shaver, these blades were so awful I went back to my mach III before the new blades arrived from Japan.  The only people giving these good reviews are people that were introduced to them as free razors.  They will shred your skin, leave tons of stubble and give you more bumps on your face than a herpes out break. Grab some feather blades as soon as possible and thank me later.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  Very pleased with the value and quality!</li>
            <li> I bought the 100 count of these before trying them out because it was a great deal but I&#x27;ve since found another brand that works much much better for me (Feather blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t terrible, they&#x27;ll get the job done, but with a lot more strokes needed and irritation after.  Not sure what to do with the 95 blades of these I still have left...</li>
            <li> I get 4 shaves out of each blade, so durability is good in my opinion. They are sharp enough for a pretty close shave, and at this price, you can toss after a couple shaves without wasting tons of money. I have no other blades to compare to, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> These razors are not the sharpest that I have ever used, nor do they seem to hold what little edge they have past the first 1 or 2 shaves.  I leave them in alcohol and it seems to make no difference. Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I wont be buying these again. Look for the Japanese or German forged blades.</li>
            <li> Why go to the barber when you can purchase it here. Its great clean feeling after shaving with Derby products. The best of the best.</li>
            <li> I received a small package of Derby blades with a double-edged razor purchase not long ago.  Prior to that I had used Shark blades (which I liked) and Feather blades (which I did not like - they are grossly overrated in my opinion).  I really like the Derby blades.  They are sharp but not so sharp that they take a layer of skin with them.  I would say my beard is moderate in thickness.  These blades seem to shave well and hold up for about a week of shaving.  They are so inexpensive that you could change them every day and still spend far less than you would spend on cartridges or disposable razors.  If you are looking for a good, inexpensive, double-edged razor blade Derby would be well worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I purchased these ones and Feather to compare which ones are better and I have to tell by far the feather edge holds for longer and shaves smoother, even after 2-3 shaves the edge is better in a feather than a brand new Derby, I ended up giving these away to my local barber.</li>
            <li> Does NOT give a clean shave. Often would end up with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Nice blades that get the job done. I only get one or two comfortable shaves out of each blade, but they&#x27;re so cheap it it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Great blades, they last a 3-5 shaves for me.  Super cheap if you&#x27;re not trying to waste money on Gillette cartridge razors</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people gave these blades a bad rating, I think they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. I get at least 4 shaves out of each blade. 100 blades of this quality for such a small price, simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur Classic DE Razor and either Proraso, Colonel Conk or a locally made vegetarian shave soap, an Omega badger hair brush and try to shave only after a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Derby&#x27;s exclusively.  I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Merkur and Derby and felt that Derby were the best for my face.  Merkurs are good but dull too quick and Feathers are too sharp for me and result in razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that Derby&#x27;s are a good price, get me anywhere from 2-4 shaves per blade and after a few hundred of them I can say they are manufactured pretty uniformly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking a DE blade is a personal choice -- these work for me and happen to be a great value, but any DE blade is a better deal than those horrible 5-blade plastic monstrosities people &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; with, so buy a bunch and pick what you like best -- just include Derby in your pool when you do.</li>
            <li> i get about 4 shaves out of 1 blade, good product for the price.......i will def buy them again good deal.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying over $2.50 for a blade for my Gillette Mach 3 razor every week so switched to a safety razor.  These Derby blades are inexpensive at about .09 each.  I find that I am using 2 blades a week, for a cost of about .18.  The shave is not quite as close, but more than acceptable.  I really appreciate the savings over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> This is a year worth of smooth shaving for less than $10!!!!.</li>
            <li> Good, sharp, clean blades. What else could you want? great value for the price. This is so much cheaper than those triple and quad-bladed razors!</li>
            <li> Derby extra is very cheap and but this affects a bit of quality. I got the 100 count and use one blade for around 10 shaves( my facial hair is not as thick as others) It seems to do the job well as I can feel my smooth face after but it seems like by the end of the afternoon there are hair growing again. Don&#x27;t know whether this was due to a non close shave or my hair is just growing faster now. My friend said that this did not provide enough sternness on his thick facial hair and he recommended Astra platinum. I will try that soon.</li>
            <li> This is now my go to razor...</li>
            <li> Great blades and a great value.</li>
            <li> Thus far,  I have sampled the following razors:  Personna - decent shave but not the sharpest though they last about a week before there is a noticeable drop in performance.  Wilkinson - cut myself 3 times on the first shave and twice on the second shave.  Poor. Feather - Very sharp but seemed to make me take more passes to get all the beard cut.  Derby - I felt it to be sharpest and smoothest of the blades used. My go to choice.  Used Shave Secret oil with all blades tested.</li>
            <li> The cost effectiveness says it all. I still have them, and only by the other disposable ones out of sheer boredom.</li>
            <li> Blades are rust free and fit my grooming comb.  Had to buy this big quantity that should last me forever, because of the quality and price that goes along wit it,</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results using these blades along with a Merkur Futur set on 3. BBS with 3 passes and 4-5 shaves per blade. Bye bye multi-blade razor systems, and razor burn.</li>
            <li> The last time I used a straight raiser was when I was a teenager going through my grandfather&#x27;s bathroom drawers looking for a razor to shave.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all, I had razor burn and I cut myself.  Its been 10 years using either a 4 or 5 blade razor.  But those are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought a LORD razor based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor for 3 months now, and it is the closest shave I have ever had.  I had to watch some youtube videos to learn to shave with it, but all they did was make me cautious.  I shaved like I normally would, up/down and sideways.  JUST DON&amp;#34;T PUT PRESSURE, LET THE RAZOR DO THE WORK. The head is heavy enough to give a nice clean shave.  I have sensitive skin and a very well trimmed beard.  This razor is great at edging the lines of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 100 pack of Derby Extra Blades for $10 on Amazon  The blades are great with this razor.  No razor burn, no cuts as long as you are careful and use a lot of lather (I bought sensitive skin shaving cream).  It does take me about 10 minutes to shave, compared to the 2 or 3 with a 5 blade.  But it is well worth the time.  And the blades will most likely last me a year!  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  $10 for a year!  I was spending over $50 a year using the 5 blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby blades for a year now, and they do a great job of shaving; you don&#x27;t feel like you are scraping and pulling hair at all; instead it is a smooth clean shave. They are also very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These razors are excellent quality and the cost was exceptionally nice.  I can get at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaving for one blade by making sure to clean the blade and all the shaver parts and then dry them.  I am getting the closest shave doing the old fashioned technique of shaving than I have ever gotten before in my life.  It&#x27;s incredible and inexpensive...goodbye gillette high price crap.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, and this product is not for me. I prefer Astra. However, this one is my brother&#x27;s favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I have been using Derby Extra blades for about 10 years.  They consistantly give a great shave no matter which of my razors I use them in.  I use each blade for about a week &amp; could probably use them longer, but they are so cheap at about 10 cents I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty throwing them away.  I have saved a lot of money these last 10 yrs. by switching to double edge shaving.  For $10 I can shave for almost 2 yrs., compared to the $3 I used to pay for each Mach 3 blade.  I am 61 yrs old &amp; started shaving with double edge razors.  I did fall for the hype &amp; shaved with cartridge razors for many years.  But the shaves weren&#x27;t any closer &amp; I was throwing my money away.</li>
            <li> i prefer derbys over all others. to each his own. get a variety pack if your new to double edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extras for several weeks now and am pleased with the quality of the blades. They don&#x27;t nick as much as other blades, and they don&#x27;t leave razor burn. I have a tough beard, so it&#x27;s important I can run the blade over my face several times. In the past, this would lead to razor burn and more nicks, but I&#x27;ve not had that problem with these razor blades. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them and, for such a good price, they are excellent.</li>
            <li> 100 blades for this price! this is a lot better than paying $25 for four of those 5 blade razors that only last one shave.</li>
            <li> With my latest razors I&#x27;ve tried these and Astras and I&#x27;ve got to say, I feel like I get a better shave with these Derbys than I do with the Astras.  Fewer nicks and all that.  I will however continue to try all the brands I can get ahold of; after all, they are all better then the original fancy razors.</li>
            <li> Not for me, apparently I have the most sensitive face on the planet. Neutral review because I haven&#x27;t found a blade yet that doesn&#x27;t leave me bumpy or bleeding.</li>
            <li> If you use a double blade, you know that some brands are near impossible to get out of their packaging without slicing your fingers.  These blades are all individually wrapped in a paper sleeve and held together in plastic boxes in sets of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, easy to change.  For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Derby blades work well for me as a daily shaver. I do love Feather blades because they shave the closest but I can&#x27;t use them every day. Although the Feather shaves closer, they give me razor burn when I use them daily. This is why I really like the Derby blades. I can do a 3 pass shave daily without razor burn and irritation. Derby is a nice blade for a low price. I have medium to thick beard growth and I get about 2 1/2 to 3 shaves with the Derby doing 3 passes. The way I see it at 9 cents a blade I can shave once and dispose of the blade and I&#x27;m still ahead of buying disposable cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, last over a week per blade maybe even 2 weeks</li>
            <li> For the price, these are good blades.  They last about five shaves before starting to pull a little, but with 100 that is not a big problem.</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use  I always wanted to use as double edge razor and now I do every morning.</li>
            <li> I get a consistently good shave with these blades. I initially tried the Sharkies and I like these better. Because they are so inexpensive I bought the 100 pack, and I use each blade for 3 shaves.  Basically this is a year&#x27;s supply of blades for me, at a few dollars total.</li>
            <li> These are high quality razors at a great price. I have got almost two weeks worth of shaving out of one blade. I think I will have this box for a year or two. I love de shaving! Best decision I have made in a while!</li>
            <li> This is the first set of blades I have bought for my DE razors. I&#x27;m currently using a SODIAL (the cheapest DE razor on Amazon from Hong Kong), and these work well. I get about 7-8 shaves each blade. I don&#x27;t really have a ton of facial hair so a blade can last me about a month...</li>
            <li> How can you not like quality, sharp double edge razor blades for $.10 ea?  Each package of 10 inside has a disposal slot on the back for used blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a novice any longer being introduced to&lt;br /&gt;wet shaving almost a year ago. Bought a starter&lt;br /&gt;Pack then opted for the 200 blade special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here it goes. Is it the best blade on the market. .No..The Worst hardly.. I place this product  in the upper third . It&#x27;s an awesome&lt;br /&gt;Forgiving blade good for newbies so they don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Cut their throats..great for experienced wet shavers as well..quality control..yes a bit shaky&lt;br /&gt;but for the price still Damm good. I have a medium coarse beard and get a full weeks worth&lt;br /&gt;Of nice shaves. Want better..buy a straight razor..I&#x27;ve heard a lot of you get what you you pay for.. With good shaving soap like Taylor of Old Bond St..and hydrating your skin properly Derby is a good product and good value...Jlewis0904@comcast.net Philly, Pa</li>
            <li> Medium sharp blades. Very forgiving. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Arrived 5 days early. Good and sharp. Might use one blade once or twice.</li>
            <li> Problem solved - FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a wise internet post about how the sharpest of razors is NOT what us with... shall I say, less than a manageable grain direction need. These blades are definitely not the sharpest, but we&#x27;re not talking shaving with a butter knife scraped against the sidewalk either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have course, curly, multi-directional beard growth these blades are probably your answer. Think of it like this. You get the sharpest blades and your face looks like you fell face first off a motorcycle. Why you ask? It&#x27;s like trying to chop an oak tree down with a Japanese katana. No matter how clean your strike you are NOT getting through in one swing and you&#x27;ll end up slicing and dicing your way back into King Gilette&#x27;s multi-bladed money scheme. These blades are like the long handled axe a lumberjack uses to strike hard, blunt, and clean to chop down that mighty oak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have coarse hair and wimpy skin do yourself a favor and get these!</li>
            <li> I got into double edge shaving mostly for economical reasons (It&#x27;s hard to argue with 100 blades for under $8), but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave as well.  Derby blades are (to me) the perfect blade. To find out what works best with YOUR face/shaving technique/products, YOU really need to try some different blades.  I tried Derby and Feather, and for me, Derby gave me the better results.  I shave pretty aggressively (I use more pressure than I probably should) and still enjoy a fine shave with no bumps, irritation, or ingrown hairs. It is a vastly superior shave to cartridges or an electric.  I use an Edwin Jagger DE89, and absolutely love shaving now.</li>
            <li> Best deal around I have to shave everyday for work with the blades I save at least 10 dollars per week</li>
            <li> I have been using a DE to shave now for 7 months. I have used Merkur blades the entire time but I saw this bargain and gave it a shot. I do not regret my decision in the least. I have only used a few blades but I think I like these blades even better. They last just as long, are sharp, and feel great. Try them if you have any curiosity. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving. This was my first purchase of blades, made necessary by the diminishing supply of blades from my initial kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Price! I use one blade per week. 100 blades is almost a two year supply! At the price, compared to plastic razors, this singular purchase has saved me enough to make the conversion to wet shaving a money saving plan (and a better shave)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Function. The Derby blades are nice and sharp, giving me a much better shave than the starter blades I received. My face is smooth and I find myself feeling it throughout the day... which makes my coworkers uncomfortable. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Packaging. The blades come in sub-packs of 5 blades per pack. If I&#x27;m travelling I can just grab one of those and throw it in my bag. The blades are then safely contained, and if I lose it, I&#x27;m only out five of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Packaging. It&#x27;s plastic. That means landfill. I&#x27;d be much happier if those 5 packs were sub-packed into little cardboard boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Yes! See you in 2014 ;)</li>
            <li> definetly worth the price but better blades out there.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  I&#x27;m am still trying to see how many shaves I can get from one blade.  It seems that the merker blades last a little longer, but Im still testing.</li>
            <li> What you see its exactly what you get!! Perfect</li>
            <li> Among all of the DE blades that I have used the Derby blades are the worst.  It&#x27;s like using an EpiLady on your face.  My beard is fairly rough and I have curly hair. My guess is that happy Derby users have a very fine and soft beards.</li>
            <li> With modern Bonded Blades costing so much shaving with an old fashion safety razor using the Derby Blades is a real cost saver. The 100 Count box will last me neatly a year plus shaving with a Safety Razor is a slow relaxing exercise.  Bonded Blades cost  at least a couple of dollars each, the Derby Blades are less than a penny each.&lt;br /&gt;  It took a little practice to go back to using an old fashion Safety Razor but well worth the time, effort and money.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with these blades, I can may be shave one cheek if I&#x27;m lucky and that&#x27;s it. after that they are like \\&quot;broken bottle\\&quot; on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the worst blades I have ever used. Never again this brand. What am I supposed to do with 99 blades left! I will be returning them to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Astra that I will be trying, hopefully they are better than these. If not I will go back to the merkur super.</li>
            <li> The blades are inexpensive and well packaged but I can only use them one time before they tear my face off. I bleed like crazy from these blades. I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated, and these derby blades make shaving a nightmare of tissue and stiptic pens.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I bought the 100 box. I should have tried sample pack first.</li>
            <li> Hubby uses a regular razor, and we&#x27;ve had some issues with lousy blades. Not these! They&#x27;re fantastic. He&#x27;s got a thick, heavy beard, so anything that can stand up to that is a GREAT razor. It slices straight thru and leaves him smooth faced! He replaces the blade about once a week, so these will last ages. The blades come in smaller packs inside the box, so easy to store in our tiny bathroom, in the medicine chest. We keep the extras in a storage area, and just replenish as needed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is a good deal, what did I pay? $6 for 100 blades? Can&#x27;t beat that price. But each blade is only good for a couple of shaves. Maybe 3 or 4 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li> I bought these in combination with the Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor and on value alone i can&#x27;t complain. 100 blades for $10 sure beats the $20+ for a pack of 4 for the old Gillette. These blades cut just as well if not better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used and they seem to hold their edge longer to me (not that it matters when they&#x27;re so cheap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i had one complaint (and i don&#x27;t) it would be that they are almost too sharp. Using these with the traditional safety razor for the first time i cut myself a lot, and these blades were so i sharp i didn&#x27;t even feel it most of the time initially.</li>
            <li> Keeps a sharp edge. I like the small 5 count packs so I can easily take one when I go on vacation. I typically use one a week but if I was inclined I bet I could get two weeks out of one blade.</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING FEATHERS, BUT I SUFFERED TOO MANY SKIN IRRITATIONS AND NICKS IN THE TROUBLE AREAS. ASTRAS WERE A LITTLE MORE FORGIVING ,VERY SHARP AND EXCELLENT VALUE. EVEN THOSE TOOK TOO MUCH SKIN OFF AFTER MULTIPLE PASSES. I STEPPED DOWN TO DERBYS AND NEVER GET NICKS OR SKIN IRRITATION. I DO A TOTAL OF THREE PASES(DOWN, SIDEWAYS AND UP). I GET ABOUT 4 TO 5  CLOSE SHAVES FOR A LOW PRICE. I&#x27;M GOIN TO STICK WITH THEM BECAUSE MY SKIN IS TOO SENSITIVE FOR THE SHARPEST BLADES AND DERBYS ARE MORE FORGIVING.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. $20 gets you enough razors for 2 years. Great blades as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband, and so far he has had no complaints. Affordable price.</li>
            <li> These babies glide across your face like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than Derby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never running out of blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades, great value. I wish I could buy blades without all of the extra plastic packaging, but it will get recycled. If I ever run out of these, haha, I&#x27;ll stick with Derby blades. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are the worst blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  These blades are dull and don&#x27;t work well and now have a bunch of worthless blades.  I hoped it was just one pack that had a bad run on the production line, but after using blades out of a couple other packs it didnt get any better. I would rate a zero if I could.</li>
            <li> I love Derbys!! They&#x27;re sharp enough without causing any irritation plus they last me 6-7 shaves easily, I could probably push them but why bother. They&#x27;re very mild on my face and I don&#x27;t get razor burn with my derby blade and a muhle R89 razor... Perfect combo. They&#x27;re great for beginner wetshavers because they&#x27;re very forgiving, however, your face/facial hair may be different from mine and this blade may not suit you but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a couple of snobs in here talking these blades down only because of its price, lol.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews and I can not believe that these blades have been rated under 4 stars. I have rated Derby&#x27;s at a 5 star. The reason I have given them 5 stars is that I have a full beard and extremely coarse hair and these blades make short work of shaving for me. I will also say that these blades are sharp and easy to use. Now I know that everyone is different, but these blades are forgiving and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t provide a comparison, but I&#x27;ve been shaving with them for a few months now and have had no trouble with them (I&#x27;m still on the first one).  I guess that means I won&#x27;t be angry that I bought such a large amount of them!  100 of them, plus the 5 that came with the razor I bought, should last me a year or two.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Get an occasional bad one but for the most part I enjoy these. I have a thick beard and I can still get 4 to 5 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, almost too sharp. I generally shave twice with them, in opposite directions for an extra close shave. The price is literally unbeatable. The value is excellent. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great blade for the price. Balanced, plenty sharp for a comfortable shave, but not tooo sharp.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li> They will last a long time before I have to buy more and really sharp!</li>
            <li> too dull!!! had to follow behind with my fusion razor. i like the shark razors and feather razors. again derby too dull!!!</li>
            <li> razor blades are razor blades. some people say these arent sharp enough. they are for me. havent cut myself yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how many guys do not know that ALL double edge razor blades are designed for single use only. Do not use them for more than one shave. Doing so will not only give you a bad shave but you are risking infection from microscopic particles of rust. Therefore, ignore comments about how long a blade lasts. It does not apply to the quality of the shave you will get. Derby&#x27;s are my favorite because they are not as ninja sharp as feather&#x27;s or merkur&#x27;s. They won&#x27;t give you any nicks or cuts. Just smooth, clean shave. They are just 8 cents each, you can afford to use them correctly as single use only. In case you are wondering they are made in Turkey.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  If these razors suit your skin type they are an excellent buy.  $10 for 100&#x3D; 10 cent a blade, lasts me 5 shaves, but I could throw away after every single shave and it would stll be a great value.</li>
            <li> These razors are decent, but I feel like they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as any other razor I have had. I also feel like these give me razor burn much more than other razors. I like the Shark blades and Wilkinson Swords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If its just a couple of bucks more expensive, go with a better quality razor. If money is tight, these will do the job and there is 100 of them, so they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot go wrong, 100 blades! If you use each blade 3 times you can go almost all year on just this pack, or you can go buy a store razor or disposable razors and just pay these huge corporations who overcharge on their product to begin with and just throw your money in the trash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 disposable razors 4.97&lt;br /&gt;1 mak 3 razor 18.99, refills 18-20$ for 3 which last a week..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 pack of derby for 300 days...no raised taxes, no constant buying, if you don&#x27;t shave with these your a moron...</li>
            <li> Very smooth and forgiving blade that gives a nice close and comfortable shave. Only knock I have on these is that they tend to dull around the 3rd shave on. But for the price these are a 5 star blade! My 2nd favorite blades behind Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
            <li> It comes down about 10 cents per piece and I usually use it for two days. It is still cheaper than other method of shaving. I still have many years of shaving left in this body, I hope. I am not going back to electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This is an average blade. Not too sharp. It will give you a so so shave even with a 3 pass. There are better blade such as a feather. Better then merkur by a little.</li>
            <li> My husband and son love these blades ! You get so many it saves $ and time from running to the store.</li>
            <li> These are my first razors and they are extremely sharp, probably not the sharpest but for the price they are miles better than cartridges</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as Feather brand but less cuts and bandaids.  Don&#x27;t have to be as cautious when shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three brands of DE blade from Amazon so far, and these are by far my least favorite.  They seem to get dull and start pulling half way through my face.  Trying to use them more than once is neigh on impossible.  I realize different people have different shaving styles and different faces, but I can only rate these on my own experience, and I don&#x27;t plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> I own a Merkur, and the Derby blades leave me feeling like I got the best barber shop shave. It&#x27;s an event to get those gray whiskers of my face and make it feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  5 stars</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave without paying the super high prices for the triple or quad blade razors/moneypits.  A nice shaving cream and brush help out too.  Check out youtube videos if you need more tips on shaving with a safty razor.  I have found a slightly different style is required to &amp;#34;save face&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used about ten of these so far, and they are certainly superior among the blades I have tried so far. Will absolutely be my next set of blades as well.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many blades but they shorted me by one pack of 5, which was kind of disappointing. Blades work great though!</li>
            <li> I have tried many blades and have found the Derby blades give me the best shave with no nicks or cuts. You can&#x27;t pick a blade based on what someone else likes. You need to find the right blade for your razor and hair type.</li>
            <li> Good product, inexpensive and shipped quickly - what more could you ask for? We will purchase again for sure.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I believe that these particular razor blades last much longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried; however, they&#x27;re priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor and I decided to purchase the Derby blades because the quantity that you get for such a cheap price is just great.  The quality is very good and I&#x27;ve been using every blade at least 3 times with no problem.  Believe it or not, razor bumps are gone!</li>
            <li> Not sharp enought to complete a full face shave!  Leave lots of nicks!  Would not recommend to other shavers.  No!</li>
            <li> razors are very good and definitely worth money. Shaving with this system will save a lot of money no need to pay $28 for 3 disposable gillettes</li>
            <li> Lifetime wet shaver. Learned to shave with safety razors and 35 years later still using them. These blades are sharp and have a decent life. The value is in the price. I always bought razors from Walgreens or Walmart, the house brand, and paid much more. At this price there is nothing to lose except loyalty to the local retailer.</li>
            <li> If you are giving this blade a 1 star review because it didn&#x27;t give you the shave you wanted stop being an idiot.  It would be the equivalent to giving a pair of size 7 shoes you bought, a one star review if you are a size 10 shoe.  These are clearly the most forgiving/non aggressive blades in the market place.  If you have a thick beard this probably isn&#x27;t going to suit you.  That doesn&#x27;t make it a poor blade, it makes it a poor blade FOR YOU.  I started off with Merkur which gave me a reasonably close shave.  I then experimented with the Wilkinson Sword which I found to be a bit too aggressive.  Gave me a nic and some razor burn.  Yes I do have sensitive skin.  I then stepped down to try the Derby.  It gave me the closest shave yet.  This is likely not due to the fact that the blade is super sharp because compared to all other it is not.  However, it did allow me to make multiple passes without any irritation which in the end is what is going to get you the closest shave.  I could not have possibly made the number of passes on some areas (5) (even without shaving cream) with either the Merkur or the Wilkinson Sword blade like I did with the Derby.)  I still have other blades from my starter pack that I plan to try.  This includes a Feather which is the sharpest of the bunch.  I fear it will be even more aggressive than the WS but we shall see.  None however will get 1 star as its such a personal fit aka one size does not fit all.  If you have have sensitive skin and not a thick beard the Derby will probably fit you nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using an Edwin Jagger DE safety razor for a couple of years due to the outrageous cost of throw-away razors.  The Derby razor blades are the best he&#x27;s used (and he&#x27;s tried a bunch).  I even bought him the sample pack with 30 different brands of blades, and he always comes back to the Derby.  You can&#x27;t beat the value and quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some of the negative reviews are from people who may be new to safety razors.  Hubby shaves three times going in different directions and has a very close, smooth shave (and he has a thick beard).  One thing that did help him tremendously in the beginning was watching a YouTube video on how to shave properly with a safety razor (the technique is different from a throw away).  The video he thought most helpful was from ShaveNation/geofatboy (we have no affiliation with them - they just had the best video).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Derby, for a great product!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time. works as advertised. The blades are sharp and can be used for at least 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the prompt service and an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely go back to this seller for more</li>
            <li> The blades are not the sharpest out there but that is not a bad thing.  I tried some Feather and they were very sharp.  So sharp in fact that left my sensitive face and neck smooth but extremely red and irritated.  The Derbys are very smooth and very forgiving.  They may not work for super heavy beards, but for my not so heavy facial hair gets shaved off smoothly and without any irritation.  For the price, you cannot beat em!!</li>
            <li> These blades are not as sharp as others and are easier on my face. No cuts etc... They also don&#x27;t last as long. The price makes up for it. These will be my main blades now.</li>
            <li> There are better blades out there but for the price, these work great.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard or remotely thicker beard these are not for your.  Stick with Feather blades because these do not cut very well.</li>
            <li> I still like using my double edged razor, but blades are extremely hard to find and expensive.  These were exactly  what I needed and quite inexpensive per blade.</li>
            <li> Originally tried these when they came free with a DE razor I purchased.  Then ran out and ordered the astra brand.  Whoa...the Derbys are by far better.  These leave your face feeling smooth with no skin irritation.  I&#x27;ll some more of these next year when I run out.  Extremely satisfied and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Any review for a DE blade is going to be subjective. What doesn&#x27;t work for you might work perfectly for others. We all have different skin, face shapes, facial hair types, and different DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is limited to those with coarse hair. I have concluded these blades are not for anyone with coarse facial hair like mine. I have read other reviews at professional shaving sites that warned of this. I got a free 5 pack sampler and decided to try them. I can confirm these findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TEST SETUP and RESULTS -&lt;br /&gt;I tried these blades on 3 different safety razors - e.g., the very forgiving Merkur 34C.&lt;br /&gt;I used each blade a maximum of 3 times for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Even with proper preparation, a pre shave oil and a perfect lather I could not get these blades to give a smooth, reasonably close shave without getting chewed up and/or needing a 4th pass! Whether I had 2 days growth or shaved daily, the blade was not gliding and cutting...but more tugging and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse facial hair, steer clear of these blades.</li>
            <li> I can only get one shave out of each side of the blade. Not bad for the price. 2 shaves per blade, 100 blades, 200 shaves, half a cent per shave. Only not all the blades are equally sharp. Some gave me a rough pull from the start. I had to flip to the other side to keep my skin intact.</li>
            <li> Good blades; very good price.</li>
            <li> These blades are super dull, they constantly wear out quick and pull on the regular, spend the extra money on feather or astra.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Edwin Jagger safety razor. Seems to last for about 3-4 shaves before needing replacing.</li>
            <li> I am totally new to DE shaving, but after reading and researching for hours on all this new-fangled old fashioned shaving stuff, I finally settled on asking for this particular blade as a gift to go with the Edwin Jagger DE87 on my gift list.  My wonderful wife got them for me and when I opened them, I really felt old school holding that retro looking package of 100 double-edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard isn&#x27;t real thick, but the whiskers are wiry and hard to cut plus I have soft, pliable, sensitive skin on my face.  This is a nice mild blade that doesn&#x27;t dull too quickly for me, I am getting 3 shaves per side, or a total of six shaves per blade (I don&#x27;t flip them over). Works out to about 10 cents per week plus soap.  I was getting the same life out of TracII refills, so this saves me about $1.40 per week.  Everybody&#x27;s different, but these work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blades, great price, and great quality - see you in two years when I need to order a new supply!</li>
            <li> These are terrific blades, and represent a great value for your dollar. I realize everyone&#x27;s needs differ, but I consistently get 5 clean, comfortable shaves per blade before changing it, and only do so because how much could do you expect for $0.09 per blade. I tried the Lords trio of blades, and found them all to give me a shave that wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as the Derby, and they always left razor rash. I&#x27;ll stick with these. One problem I had, was the pack of 100 arrived with the top of the package crushed, and 5 of the plastic packets inside were severly damaged. I don&#x27;t know if the blades were damaged as a result of this, as I haven&#x27;t tried those particular blades as yet. I believe they were damaged pre shipping, as the external shipping package was unmarred.</li>
            <li> Darn good middle of the road blade really.  Not the sharpest not the dullest. Just average but I was looking for an average blade for my adjustable and these fill the bill nicely. Give em a shot, heck ya can&#x27;t beat the performance for the price.</li>
            <li> will never have to buy another blade</li>
            <li> Good quality and price</li>
            <li> These razors are my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth cut (sometimes cuts too much maybe)...&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the price as well :).&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to support Derby .</li>
            <li> Really not Impressed with the results of the Derby.So I ordered a multi pack sampler that I found on EBay.The sampler included two Astra which gave me the best results.The sampler also included two Feather blades which were extremely sharp and difficult to use no matter how careful I was,would not recommend the &amp;#34;Feather Double Edge&amp;#34; .I also purchased the Mekur  double edge razor (on Amazon) great razor. Save your self some cash and purchase a sampler pack it&#x27;s the best way to go.</li>
            <li> I actually received a five pack with the razor I bought. It came with one Merkur and five Derby&#x27;s. It took a month to eventually use the Merkur and it was still good when I replaced it just to try these critters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell much difference. However I had to remember in what position I placed the Merkur in the razor. The Derby has numbers on each corner of each side of the blade to help me remember how it is placed in the razor. The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time. I save the original wrapping for disposal as I have curious cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am not sensitive enough to tell a difference in the blades. I can tell without a doubt that double edge safety blades outperform cartridges. It looks like it is going to be about a while before I can really compare blades so I bought some other brands based on recommendations.  However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 5 blades so far in about 3 months shaving every 2nd or 3rd day. I have a Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Razor and they work great together. I have a thick beard with very thick hair and I&#x27;ve been very happy with this blade&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> Like most people I turned to a DE (safety) shaver in full scale revolt against overpriced drugstore razors from Gillette, Schick, etc.  My new DE shaver included a starter pack of these blades.  They seemed to work well enough, so I bought this 100 pack.  Are there better DE blades out there by other manufacturers?  I really don&#x27;t know - these are all I&#x27;ve ever tried.  All I can tell you is that they work much better than drugstore razors and they are ridiculously cheap.  I shave every day and change blades once per week, which means that this 100 pack will last me almost 2 years!  I actually think each blade would last longer than 1 week, but since they are so cheap I figure why not splurge a little, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous about getting into DE shaving because everyone with a DE shaver seems to use a fancy brush and expensive creams.  I don&#x27;t have time for that in the morning.  Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need a brush or fancy cream - good old canned shave cream foam (Barbasol or similar) works fine with DE blades.  Heck, use a brush and cream/soap if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing, but if quick and cheap is more your style, foam is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about disposal - even a week old DE blade is still VERY sharp!  Be careful how you dispose of old blades, as they can easily slice through trash bags and cut someone.  I&#x27;d recommend keeping a glass or hard plastic container in your drawer and throwing them in there.  I use an old glass jelly jar.  Then when the jar is full, dispose of jar and old blades all at once.</li>
            <li> So I used to use those multi-blade razors until they got insanely over priced. I&#x27;m glad they did or I would have never thought of shaving the way my dad does with these razor blades. I got these a long with a Lord razor and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear. It&#x27;s really cheap and coming from a guy who has to shave every third day, they work awesome.</li>
            <li> These blades have a great price; however, they do not work on my beard. I recommend trying smaller batch first.</li>
            <li> I used it and none of it is sharp.Each blades can be used only one time and it pains when you shave.Compared to other blades,this blades from Turkey is not good.PLEASE DONT BUY</li>
            <li> I agree with many others that getting the correct wet shave is trial &amp; error marked with some blood sacrifice. I returned to shaving with a double edge after years of not doing so and I&#x27;m on both my second shaver &amp; box of blades. These blades are very forgiving... they&#x27;re not as aggressive as others so that means you don&#x27;t cut off every whisker with a single stroke. It takes several passes to get a smooth shave but I&#x27;m not cutting myself as much and the razor burn is all but gone. I shave for convenience three times a week and if it&#x27;s not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind I really don&#x27;t care. I tried the Astra  blades and they were more aggressive and I bled more but it&#x27;s really all a matter of perfecting my stroke... most cuts were under the nose and in the corner of my mouth. I need to work on my skin tightening and facial muscles to make the razor glide more easily. I also need to ensure that the angle of razor to face is more consistent. All that said, I think these are pretty good blades and the packaging is good. At a price under 7 bucks with Subscribe &amp; Save I&#x27;m happy with these. I would also recommend that if you&#x27;re new to shaving you try a variety pack... and I wish I had done so. Shaving with a double edge is a matter of finding the correct balance between razor, blade, technique &amp; lather so what works for someone else will likely end in \\&quot;results may vary\\&quot;. If there is a downside to these blades it&#x27;s the lack of consistency in quality. I find that about 1 in 5 blades is dull either on both edges or a least one to the point that you can&#x27;t shave with it but I do get about 5 shaves per blade so if I can&#x27;t use about 10-14 blades per 100-pack the price is still good but I now am a believer in those other reviews that state there&#x27;s a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, great price, and each blade lasts me about 10 shaves (I do have a lighter beard, though). They&#x27;re not my favorite blade, but they&#x27;re excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> These razors worked just fine, and they&#x27;re cheap! They are sharp, they cut down hairs with a smooth finesse, and they&#x27;re far cheaper than cartridges. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I ditched the Cartridge razors many years ago in favor DE razors and man was it a great choice. So much cheaper and each blade lasts just as many shaves as a cartridge razor ever did but at a fraction of the cost. It&#x27;s amazing what you can do with the cash saved just from not having to buy ridiculously expensive razors all year long. I paid for part of a vacation with that savings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not feather blades (those are ninja sword sharp). These however are even better priced and a pack of a 100 should last you a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and have a great shave for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a merkur progress long handled razor, best handle I own at this point and I have a small collection of them.</li>
            <li> At fist I didn&#x27;t even want to try the Derby blades because of all the reviews I read in the past of how dull they are compared to other brands.  But then I got to try some Derby blades that came free with a shaving brush I bought, and I am so glad I did.  Yes they are not the sharpest blades out there but for a beginner wet shaver they&#x27;re very forgiving.  I can live with a little tug and pull as long as I&#x27;m getting clean and irritation-free daily shaves.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, I bought this a while back and still haven&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I find that I need multiple touch up with these blades.  I shave using the 3 pass procedure and find that it does not get the desired result.  The value is good but just plan to take some extra time.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is replace the blades often to prevent any skin irritation and to develop smooth skin. I am an African - American, male, and have been using a double edge razor for almost two years. Since I first picked up the double-edge razor I&#x27;ve reduced appearances of razor bumps while being able to shave like my Angelo-Saxon friends. Merkur blades where just too expensive to switch out on a daily basis, but prolong periods of using the same stainless-steel blade can still develop bacteria which can cause irritation. My skin is very sensitive but these blades work great and are cheap enough to switch out the blades often.</li>
            <li> These are what I would call a very mild razor blade.  No cut skin, and no skin irritation, but the trade off is not a very close shave.  I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard, but one pass with this razor blade and I can feel stubble. While there are other blades out there and after one pass the skin is smooth.  I&#x27;m not a fan of pushing a razor over my face three or four times, although there are many out there who are.  These blades might be great for a beginner because they are very forgiving.  They are smooth and don&#x27;t cause irritation, they just don&#x27;t give a very close shave.  But I would certainly give them a try, as long as you don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> Solid, well made, and all-around fine safety razors at a great price buying in a 100 count pack. Fine razors.</li>
            <li> these blades are alright, ive gone through about 15 of them now, and i can use them for about 2 shaves per blade normally flipping the blade for the second shave. but they do irritate my face if i do not shave more then every other day. and somedays the blades work better then other days. but maybe thats just my wet shave technique changing from shave to shave..</li>
            <li> I gave these razors an extra star, because you can usually buy a pack of 100 for less than $10. They shave fine, my only complaint would be that they get dull very quickly. But, lets face it, for the price, you could use a brand new razor every time you shave. On my face, I can usually get 2 shaves out of one blade (1 shave being with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain). Not bad. During the summer, I shave my arms, legs and chest, and I can get away with using a blade one time on my legs and a new blade each time I shave my arms and chest. Again, for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> These blades are awesome. For the price, you can not beat them. I use each razor once and then move on to the next. Still cheaper then cartridges. The only comparable shave I have gotten is from a Mach 3 cartridge blade, but they are getting more expensive. If you have started using a safety razor I highly recommend trying these blades. I have a thick course beard and usually shave after 4-5 days worth of growth.</li>
            <li> The blades last about a week long and work as good as any other name brand that I can find, if you use a old safety razor these fit the bill!</li>
            <li> I am happy with blades. However the crappy dispenser allow used blades to fall out. If you have ever had the joy to shave with a double edge you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews that these were a good value, I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a pack of the Shark brand, which were good, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference with these, with the exception that they cost much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use each blade only once, not sure how many times you can, in theory, use each. That&#x27;s the extent of my &amp;#34;durability&amp;#34; test.</li>
            <li> I was a first timer and cut my fingers accidentally. But otherwise these things are awesome! You have to get the hang of it though if you&#x27;ve been using trash like Gillette</li>
            <li> I purchased a sampler to try a few different blades including Astra, Feather, Crystal, Personna (red), Merkur and Derby.  All these blades were decent and did the job but the Derby blades were my least favorite.  I have a fairly coarse beard with sensitive fair Irish skin.  The Derby blades pulled a lot and for some reason had a lot of trouble with nicks in the neck area where I didn&#x27;t with the other blades I was trying, they just didn&#x27;t seem very sharp.  I would use them again if I had them and no other blades, but would not likely ever purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have said in other reviews, blade reviews are very subjective and I what I like or don&amp;#39;t like could be just the opposite for you, so worth a try if you haven&#x27;t tried them!</li>
            <li> The price is right and the edge is good. I will buy them again. But I have to say 100 blades will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does tug after a few shaves. All in all this is a great blade. I have compared with the astra&#x27;s, and in reality for my face, I see no difference. If you want a milder blade, buy these.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how many blade 100 is until you get this package. Comes packed in 5-blade boxes (just like you&#x27;d buy at the drug store). Highly recommended. Very economical.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for 3 years. They are great. This is my second order. Expect 100 blades to last about two years. These blades stay sharp long enough to get through a week. Use care on day one of if you are not familiar with them. New people to DE shaving should not rate these blades until they have had enough time to become familiar with the shaving technique.</li>
            <li> Really flimsy compared to every other blade I have tried. They lose their edge very very fast. Having to use so many means they really aren&#x27;t inexpensive. And they don&#x27;t work as well new.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of razors.  They all work well.</li>
            <li> This is a very economically way to by some nice blades.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s old razor works best for shaving&lt;br /&gt;legs in the tub.  Those little plastic things&lt;br /&gt;clog up, take off pieces of skin, and are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are hard to find these days, so a big&lt;br /&gt;supply like this should last forever.</li>
            <li> TL;DR: Cheap and plentiful blades to learn with, but not very sharp and won&#x27;t last for thick beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For others:&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have tried featherblades and crystal blades, I think these are terrible. I have a very thick beard and it takes approximately one razor to do each side of my face and then one half razor to finish the center. They aren&#x27;t very sharp and they served their purpose - an opportunity for me to learn how to shave safely with a double edge razor. At the same time, these are cheap blades and I think beginner should start on something sharper - you get so much more for your money when you do. A pack of 100 blades really is a quarter of a year supply with a beard like mine. Feather blades last for two shaves and crystals similar. When you do the math, you don&#x27;t save any buying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want these blades, only buy 10-20 to learn and then move onto the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/</li>
            <li> Terrific razor blades.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I use this with my safety razor and change the blade after every two or three shaves.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Used in our bakery every day. Made in Europe not China!</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that these blades were not the best choice for me. However that does not mean that they are not good blades. They were a little too aggressive for me, but for others they may be a perfect blade. That said, this is a lot of blades for a really good price. The blades are individually wrapped in 5-pack plastic holders which makes them really convenient for travelling. The plastic case also serves as a &amp;#34;sharps&amp;#34; container to hold the used blades so when you throw them out you are not risking slicing yourself or your trash collecter up. The blades themselves were extremely sharp, and each one lasted a full week of daily shaving. They probably could have lasted longer but at the price, I really don&#x27;t see a reason to continue using a blade after a week.</li>
            <li> will buy agian  gives a close shave</li>
            <li> Too dull for my face, but they&#x27;re SUPER cheap if they work for you.</li>
            <li> Blades are smooth, sharp, and inexpensive.  I get 7 or 8 good shaves from one blade...easy.  Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Great shave  works good  medium length for longevity.</li>
            <li> I have been a wet shave(r) for years and these have become my go to blades. I am able to get four shaves per blade and have what is considered a heavy beard.  I use these with an Edwin Jagger Safety razor and the experience is transcendent.</li>
            <li> great value. easy to use.</li>
            <li> Some blades in the pack were great and lasted up to 2 weeks, but others were a bit rough after a few days. Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving with a DE razor I tried nearly a dozen different brands of blades before settling on Derby as the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck&amp;#34;. That first box of 100 blades lasted for nearly four years, much longer than I had expected. Normally I would change blades every weekend, but sometimes a blade would last two weeks or more without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I received my next batch of 100, in November 2013, everything changed. In less than one year, I have gone through more than half of the blades in the box. I now find myself going through two or three blades IN ONE MORNING, before finding one that wasn&#x27;t either scraping my face or stamped so poorly it wouldn&#x27;t sit correctly in my razor. I wish I knew what the heck happened between 2009 and 2013, but it wasn&#x27;t good. Hopefully their production issues will have gotten worked out before I need to order more blades or I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brand again.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 45 years. Haven&#x27;t been satisfied with most \\&quot;hi-tech\\&quot; nonsense razors systems in America for a long time.  So I bought an old school double edge razor and a big box of Derby Extra blades.  Well, these blades are great.  However, if you are not skilled at shaving, they can cut you to ribbons because they are very thin and very sharp.  For guys who know what they are doing, thin and sharp are just what we are looking for. But I suspect people who never learned to shave properly and have been using modern tech type razors, that are far more forgiving, you may have problems.  You must shave properly with these.  If you do they give outstanding results.  If you are young and no one ever taught you how to shave properly, I highly recommend you watch some \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on You Tube before trying anything like these real blades.</li>
            <li> I threw them away its better of just to go with the merkur razors. you can only use these once and change them out. The merkur ones you can use themup to 5 times which is like 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> i choose this for times when i have a long growth of facial hair and the multi-blade razors clog after one swipe</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these since December and loves them. He says they can be hit or miss on sharpness but at .07 each if it wasn&#x27;t as sharp he only uses it once and throws it out. I love how smooth his skin is with these razors. He says he will never go back to the regular razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same blade for two weeks, I shave 3-4 times a week and it feels like it can take a couple of shaves more. With that said, I have a stock that will last aprox. 3 years. For those gillette mach3 guys (like me): it shaves as close as those blades, just without the exta $$$$.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp.  Exactly what I expected based on the review I read before the purchase.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Isn&#x27;t as sharp or last as long as others, however you get a lot of shaves for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many blades and thought, since this brand came with my razor, it couldn&#x27;t be too bad.  At @ 7 cents a blade it was a good deal.  I&#x27;ve used several of the blades and they&#x27;ve all been great on the first shave... then, like anything, you&#x27;ve got grades of reliability.  Some blades, or half the blade, seemed a little dull and pulled slightly after the second or third shave.</li>
            <li> sharp, inexpensive, a 2 year supply</li>
            <li> I went by the reviews and low price but I&#x27;m not thrilled. First, they&#x27;re made in Turkey, not Sweden. Second, right out the box it felt like I was shaving with a butter knife, and my beard isnt that heavy. I&#x27;ve been a safety razor user for 4 years using Gillette, Wilkerson, and Merkur. I&#x27;ll finish the 5-pack to see if my skin adjusts but I&#x27;m not enthused</li>
            <li> I had a very lengthy review from earlier this year but have found these razors to be too dull to have as everyday shaving.  These blades are a great value but so are Astra which are now my blade of choice  and cost less than $10 on Amazon for 100 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  Check out [[ASIN:B000I2XL38 The Art of Shaving Sandalwood Pre-Shave Oil]] which I have been using a sample size recently to help my daily shaves.  There are many others out there but I can attest to the quality of this Pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful and I highly suggest get a sampler of different DE razors to see which works best for beginners first.ch, these are probably some of the dullest blades you can get but forgiving for beginners like me.  If you choose sharper blades such as with Japanese Feather blades - super sharp - you will slice your face up unless you experience with DE blades and know how to use your technique very well. These blades are good for my sensitive skin and and since I don&#x27;t have a thick beard - it suits my needs.  I heard of others like the BIC or Red Persona an Israeli company that makes middle of the road blades are suitable for people who may have thicker beards.  Some may even need sharper ones out there but its really a matter of preference, beard thickness and depends on the type of skin you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, to make an even better shaving experience I recently started using shave oil.  Shave oil makes the DE blade glide much easier as well causing less irritation and creates a layer of added protection especially on the troublesome neckline for many guys.  Check out [[ASIN:B000I2XL38 The Art of Shaving Sandalwood Pre-Shave Oil]] which I have been using a sample size recently to help my daily shaves.  There are many others out there but I can attest to the quality of this Pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone down to my last blade with these and I&#x27;ll say they work well. I&#x27;ve had another brand that chopped up my face and head, but now looking back I realize that these Derby blades are a bit more forgiving for first time users. The price of the blades (even starting up for that matter) is a lot cheaper than buying the more modern shavers. This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works great with the razor</li>
            <li> Fair price, and numbered, so you can remember if you flipped the blade, (for those of us who don&#x27;t shave every day).</li>
            <li> After 15 years away from the DE scene I recently went back to it, partly to save my aged, sun damaged skin from the multi-blade scraping of cartridge razors and partly because I just couldn&#x27;t see the value in $16.95 for 5 more cartridges.  I have an old Gillette Ball-End razor, but also bought a new Merkur HD, and also the Derby blades based on reading about various blades on line.  The Derby blades are easy on my skin, with much less irritation than the cartridge blades, and work well in both razors, though I favor the Merkur.  To avoid skin irritation I must draw the razor somewhat slowly, feeling the blade smoothly cutting the whiskers.  I get 4 really good shaves out of a blade, and could squeeze 1 or 2 more but that requires a little more force and thus increased irritation, so after 4 shaves I go to a new blade.  If I experiment with another blade it will be only out of curiosity because the Derby blades seem about perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> When I retired from the military I was able to let my beard grow for a change.  It was actually nice not to shave or so I thought.  When letting it go for too long for 5 or more days, the double, triple and even the quadruple bladed cartridges razors could not cut through the forrest.  I found my grandpas&#x27; old clam razor.  Wow!  What a great smooth shave.  I bought a simple double edge razor and then found these extra blades from Derby.  100 of them in fact for alot less money than you could ever expect.  These blades are sharp and last awhile, but I change it out sooner cause my son loves shaving with that razor too.  I am telling you that the shave is nice and boy it sure is nice never to pay the for those costly cartridges anymore.</li>
            <li> great quality, no complaints</li>
            <li> Razor blade performance seems to be dependent on a couple of variables- the individuals face, and the razor the blades are used in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these blades to Dorco and Astra blades (the only other ones I have tried) with my simple 3 piece razor.  They give a close shave with minimal razor burn.  When I tried them with my feather razor, they results were not as good.  I think that razor does not position the blade as aggressively, so I had to take more passes to get a close shave.  This resulted in razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only get 2 to 3 shaves from each blade.  They are so inexpensive, that this is not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This works great. The blades are sharp and comfortable to shave.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a surprise gift for my husband and he loved it! The cost of these razors are so cheap in comparison to cartridges for the old razors we would purchase at the store!</li>
            <li> Tried these in a sample pack. They hurt like heck. Nicks and scrapes abound. I used one and threw the rest away. I will never buy these ever again.</li>
            <li> These are great blades for the money. Works as described and easy to install into the razor. Highly recommend this to anyone looking a good blades.</li>
            <li> It would be really useful to me if there was a 25 count of these blades. I don&#x27;t need a new blade as often as others and each blade can last around 3 shaves. This 100 count has got me covered for the next 4 to 6 years at least depending on how often I shave or change the blades. There is also the problem of trying to find these in regular stores, which forces me to buy these in bulk from a place like Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are just dull enough to allow for varied pressure but not sharp enough to shave cleanly in the first pass. I find it to be the best mix for rush shaving and close results and for that reason these blades work in my advantage.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and lasts for about a week before dullness and stains set in. Have used about 10 blades and have no cause for complain.</li>
            <li> I got a variety pack awhile back and the Derby Extras gave me the best shave and lasted the longest. The razors arrived as advertised, they were in a long cardboard box with plastic 5packs inside. The plastic 5packs have a slot for the used razors.</li>
            <li> outstanding product i wish i would have bought years ago...would recommend this product without hesitation. easy to use and like i said a close shave</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t cut it. I do not have a strong beard and this is the first time that I encounter new blades pulling rather than cutting hair. These blades are not less aggressive, they are simply dull. Feather, Wilkinson, or Merkur blades, even one-blade throwaway Bic razors, are sharper after one week of use than these blades are on day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the many good reviews, I wonder whether I simply got a bad batch or whether this company spends it&#x27;s marketing budget on creating fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Very forgiving blade, but does not provide me with a smooth, close shave. Won&#x27;t hurt to try them, though. Maybe they&#x27;ll be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> A 100 blades for $7? I was immediately drawn to this. Unfortunately derby blades are a bit too dull for my face, but that is a subjective issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades have a good reputation, a huge following, and are probably the most economical option available concerning blades. Great starting point for beginners, but one should determine later, with more experience shaving, if 100 is needed.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Razor blades tend to be a controversial topic for some. Some people swear by certain brands and avoid all others. For me, these blades worked great. They probably could be a little sharper. However, as long as I switched the blades every other day, it wouldn&#x27;t affect my shave. For the price, you won&#x27;t find better blades. Shipping speed was excellent.</li>
            <li> I thought these razors were pretty dull. I&#x27;ve heard they are for beginners but I needed something sharper.(Derby \\&quot;Extra Dull\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will get a blade that doesn&#x27;t tug and pull, sometimes I will get one that does tug and pull. I don&#x27;t have a full beard either so I don&#x27;t know how these would treat somebody with a Chewbacca amount of hair. The price point for the quality /quantity is dang good though. The quality of these blades are OK and seem to be hit/miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I am unsure if I would purchase more of these. You get a lot of blades for the money but the quality (in the pack I received at least) is not consistent.</li>
            <li> ....sharp blade...?  Well, of course, anytime you are dragging one across your face, he says.  It&#x27;s true, nothing worse than a dull razor blade...and a good razor, I use Edwin Jaegger.  This is a terrific shaving combination, the Derby blades and the razor... I can barely feel the blade removing my beard...perhaps the best shavng combination I have ever owned.  and with deal on the blades, I am set for quite a long time...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat price. One blade is good enough for me!!!</li>
            <li> Okay but Astra&#x27;s win my vote.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my dad!</li>
            <li> These blades are great value for the price. Basically over two years of good quality shaving for less than one small package of disposable, environmentally traitorous disposable razors. I&#x27;m very glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price nor the shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/09/2016:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been working on this package of blades now for about 3 years. The cost of these blades have certainly saved me over $100 in traditional cartridge blades. I would like to comment on the shave. 90% of the blades are incredibly sharp and will last me at least 1-2 weeks. Once they begin to get dull, they really pull. 10% of the blades are good for less than 5 days. I&#x27;m not sure about the consistency Derby has when producing these blades. Overall, for the price, I can live with tossing 1 out of every 10 blades within a week. I am very satisfied with these cost effective blades and recommend them for any new DE wet shaver.</li>
            <li> So glad I picked these. So tired of Gillette&#x27;s HIGH PRICES</li>
            <li> I have bought half a dozen razor blades to test before I bought a large quantity.  Derby blades were the best blade I tried.  The blades are reasonably priced less than 10 cents a blade. One side of the blade is marked 1,2 and the other side is marked 3,4, so you can rotate the side of the blade used.  I get 10 to 14 days out of each blade and I shave my moderate beard every other day. I don&#x27;t get cut with the blade, but do get an occasional weeper. I wish the blades were sharper as I have to make three passes to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I just started using a safety razor to start shaving after I finished all my Mach 3 Razors and the replacement cartridges cost well over 2 Dollars a piece. With this you get 100 Good quality razors that work fantastic for a beginner. The total cost with this, my razor handle and a soap set only set me back $24 and its going to last me a couple of years!</li>
            <li> when you can spend less than $8.00 and get a high quality shave for almost a full year. These blades are great. no pulling, dragging, or irritation on my Merkur 34HD. Gillette can kiss it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely dull. Tortured my half face for ten minutes and gave up. Doesn&#x27;t shave at all. Unfortunately before buying read only the good reviews. Not sure how other people write good reviews...</li>
            <li> Wish these were sharper.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I have / tried using for a double edge razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other but, they has done a solid job.</li>
            <li> These blades are OK but not my favorite. The Derby is not as sharp as others but may suite others needs. This is a very economical blade so that would be a plus. The Voshkod and Gillette Silver Blue provided better shaving results and more shaves per blade for me.  As always, your results my differ.</li>
            <li> I have had some time now to compare blades to one another and get a feel for which ones do best in my razor, an Edwin Jagger 89lbl.  A pack of 5 Derby blades came with this razor, and it seems that the people at Edwin Jagger know what they are doing.  These Derby blades provide a good shave without skin irritation.  At a bulk price of less than 10 cents per blade, they are as close to free as you will ever get.  There are many shaving snobs out there that act as if shaving is high art.  For me switching to shaving with a double edge safety razor and all it involves has made shaving a joy for me and I look forward to it as much as my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I have realized a few things so far.  Preparation is the most important, just like every other task.  A hot shower really does help hydrate the skin.  I actually prefer a hot washcloth.  It is amazing what you can use a microwave for: a normal washcloth wet, then squeezed out, rolled up and heated for 50 seconds works for me. I also heat a mug of water as my tap water meets the current building code for temperature, which means it isn&#x27;t hot enough. I heat all this up while making coffee, so no time wasted. Then, and here is the key, I use 4 drops of pre-shave oil, prior to whipping up some shave cream. I currently use Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shaving cream, but any good shave cream will work well.  After prepping as explained, my shave this morning with a fresh Derby blade is as good as I expect out of any blade.  My priorities in a blade are skin protection first, cut whiskers second.  I have used Feather blades and they are amazingly sharp, but quite harsh on my sensitive skin.  The Derby gives a great shave without the raw feeling of the Feather.  I shave only down grain and cross grain.  That super smooth against the grain shave isn&#x27;t worth my face burning the rest of the day.  These are excellent blades for me and my beard, and should be an excellent choice for anyone experienced or newto double edge shaving.   To anyone is considering purchasing Derby blades, it is a zero risk purchase. At less than 10 cents/blade, even if you change blades daily, they are inexpensive.  I get about a week out of a Derby blade and usually change it just because it seems like it&#x27;s been a while.  My last shave with the blade is still a good shave. Enjoy.  Save your money for something else, like good beer.</li>
            <li> Medium rating in sharpness, but works well in a more aggressive DE razor. Great for beginners to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> These probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best thing if you had really super thick hair or were planing to shave your head with them or something, but for medium hair/ womens leg hair (yes, ladies, these are better than Venus razors!) they&#x27;re just right. Sharper by far than Sharks, but not as sharp as Feathers. They last a good long time but won&#x27;t cut you to peaces if you press just a little too hard, either. They don&#x27;t rust as fast as the Sharks, for that matter. No more Shark razors for this girl!</li>
            <li> Medium quality blade . Sharpness seems to be like the sharks. I used it in a ReMei razor and it did a good job removing a day’s worth of stubble on the first pass. Clean up passes didn’t result in a much better shave. Did well with the buffing technique. Seems to work best when shaving daily. I stopped using the blade after a week but it still had some life in it (I wanted to try another blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did an alright job in the Weishi (my usual razor). The normal techniques didn’t work well but the Schick Slide did well. That style is not for beginners. I got two weeks out of the blade but I probably should have stopped after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This blade is not as sharp as some others, which may suit your needs if you have light to medium growth or are learning how to shave with a DE. If you have thicker growth, it may snag some and lose its edge quickly although I may have experienced that because I shave every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so this razor may be better for you than it was for me.  I prefer a sharper razor than this, but the reason I rate it only 2 stars is the inconsistency in the blades.  Roughly 1 in 5 blades would be noticeably duller, unusable even.  100 blades for $10 is a great value, but if 20 of those blades mangle your face, you&#x27;re better off spending a couple extra bucks on a better brand.</li>
            <li> Great blades - use them all the time.</li>
            <li> I get two good shaves from each razor with no cuts or scrapes so far. So a pack of 100 will last me a year since I usually don&#x27;t shave on weekends.</li>
            <li> Go with the feather. These are barely ok. I tried them again after having used feathers for a while. You can really tell the difference. The feathers cost more. But we&#x27;re still talking pennies of difference per shave. Who cares?</li>
            <li> These work best for me on their second shave - I should probably try corking, but so far it&#x27;s working well enough. Scored the whole box for $5 on sale too.</li>
            <li> Sharp thin blades. Good price per amount.Saves a lot of money as compared to the price of the standard modern razor.</li>
            <li> These are simply great blades. I have tried several different blades of each of these:  Derby, Astra, Bic, Gillette Silver Blue, Gillete 7 O Clock Black, Nacht, Personna and Feather. These are all excellent blades. But I keep coming back to the Derby. the Derby is not the sharpest blade, but the shave is so much smoother and less irritating, I can get a BBM shave readily with three light passes and a few advanced passes over key areas. The closest to these is the Gillete Silver Blue. Also excellent, a little sharper but very smooth.  Next in line is the Bic. Then the Gillette Seven O&#x27;Clock Blacks..they are much sharper, and also extremely smooth, but cut the skin much more readily. The toughest is the Feather. It is extremely sharp, but even if you don&#x27;t cut yourself, the pass is rough and irritates my skin. While I get done faster with the Feather, I don&#x27;t actually get a closer shave, and generally do get irritation. So, it is always a matter of personal taste. I can only say that for my beard and skin, the Derby gives me a shave as close as anything I&#x27;ve gotten with with other blades, and it does so with very, very little irritation. Oh, and the blades, with light stropping, give me two solid weeks of close shaves.</li>
            <li> There are countless DE Blades competing for attention. I&#x27;ve tried several&lt;br /&gt;brands, &amp; find Derby to offer superior performance without having to hock&lt;br /&gt;my possessions to purchase them. I&#x27;m unsure of where they are manufactured,&lt;br /&gt;but blades are of excellent construction, giving smooth, close shaves, without&lt;br /&gt;the need for alum nor styptic pencils. They last longer as well, but this is only&lt;br /&gt;from my perspective. Each face &amp; attitude differs, so it&#x27;s really subjective, relative&lt;br /&gt;experiences that make/break these products. Thanks to Amazon for providing&lt;br /&gt;them @ great prices, along with top flight deliveries &amp; customer/consumer services.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with these for the price.  My safety razor came with Derby&#x27;s and I liked them.  Tried a couple others and found I prefer the Derby&#x27;s.  And you get a box of 100 for $8!  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I compared these to the high-end German blades. Surprisingly, you can tell the difference. The first shave isn&#x27;t so bad, but that&#x27;s when it ends. Unfortunately, it will take me a long time to get through all of these blades, so I&#x27;m wishing I hadn&#x27;t bought such a big box. What other uses are there for double edge blades?</li>
            <li> Like others have said all faces are different, so no blade can be called &amp;#34;best&amp;#34;.  I bought a variety pack of blades when I switched to DE shaving, and found the Derby Extra to be best for my face.  I have to change blades after a couple of shaves, but the price for 100 blades is a super bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the price, turns out they are my favorite blade. Better than Astra, Shark and some other brand I tried. Seem to last for more shaves too.</li>
            <li> There are better blades like Astra for the money.  This is an excellent starter blade for new wet shavers but once you get your technique down, you might want to go with something a little sharper.  Most people on the shaving forums feel the same. Overall, not a bad blade but not great either.</li>
            <li> Cheap and sharp!  One blade will lasts about 3 or 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Sharp but not excessively sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly a few of complaints I&#x27;ve heard about these are that they aren&#x27;t as sharp as X or Y. I got a kit of a few blades to test and these are the best for most people. Another blades are to  damn aggressive I have a sensitive skin so I try to be careful with what I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something more, not sure who to blame (Derby, Amazon or the import service / UPS ) but the package end up missing 10 blades ( 2 sets of 5 ) not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a single edge razor user.  Absolutely worth the $.</li>
            <li> Wow these blades are sharp! Used them on my Edwin jagger de89. The cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in so long. These blades are very sharp, use caution when using. First time using them, I did nick myself once. They get your face so clean cut! It&#x27;s amazing that this single blade does a better job than the 10 blade Gillette turbo ultra vibrating swivel jet. Best buy for your money</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as Astra.</li>
            <li> Great blades and very affordable.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat a good shave with a real blade</li>
            <li> Some DE experts would say these aren&#x27;t the best, but I have no complaints about them.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and I can safely say they work very well for the beginner.  Once you perfect your technique, you can buy better ones if you feel like it.  Highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Merlin</li>
            <li> What a deal! I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s a pretty good idea to change blades every few shaves, and even after about a year of frequent replacements, there are still plenty left. If the zombie apocalypse happens in the near future, I&#x27;ll have a nice clean shave for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Great value and get a good shave with my mekur futur</li>
            <li> Purchased along with Merkur razor for my husband.</li>
            <li> People say to try verity packs with different blades to find which is &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; for you and I almost did...but didn&#x27;t. My razor came with a 5 pack of these blades. I get a very close shave with a single pass, no irritation, no nicks or cuts, no reason to try anything else. I shave Mon-Fri and the blade doesn&#x27;t feel dull to me until about shave 8, 9, or 10. That&#x27;s a blade every 2 weeks(ish). I won&#x27;t need to buy blades again for at least 3 years. Crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a variety of DE razor blades when I first started using DE razors.  While they all easily outperform every commercial market razor blade (the disposable cartridges with 4-5 dull blades type) out there, the DE razor blade types certainly can be a matter of personal preference.  I have fairly sensitive skin, and the Derby Extra DE blades have worked out the best for me.  Smooth shave with no razor burn and isn&#x27;t overly aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What may be helpful for people in general is to try is a sampler pack, which you can find online by searching for DE Blade Sampler Packs.  That way, you can try out a number of different blade types without ending up with 100 blades you don&#x27;t want.  You&#x27;ll find that you have to slightly alter how you shave with each different blade, and there are nuances to each type that you&#x27;ll like/dislike.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this many blades, but I find they don&#x27;t hold an edge nearly as well as Feather blades. I&#x27;ll be switching back to those as soon as I work my way through these.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp when new but don&#x27;t seem to last as long as others that I&#x27;ve used.  I get maybe two shaves with each blade before they get too dull to use again.</li>
            <li> My  favorite blades and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I am leaving this review based on only using this blade, not comparing it to other blades. This is the first blade I have ever tried, and it works great. I think they are a good value and they work just fine in my Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
            <li> These blades do a good job, but they seem to dull faster then the Shark Double Edge blades I used up. The Derby blades seem to be good for 3 to 4 shaves then I&#x27;m looking to replace them. The Shark blades seemed to last at least twice that long. My next purchase, I&#x27;m going to plan on spending a little extra money and go back to the Shark.</li>
            <li> Great blades. They would probably last for 3 or 5 shaves, but they are so cheap I just grab a new one every time. I also like that it is in retail packaging so I can just grab a new 5 pack out from under the sink whenever and the rest stay in their nice little box.</li>
            <li> Have used these blades for the past few years.  While not the best, they are cheap and a good value for the money.  Quality is somewhat inconsistent.  If I open a blade that has a defect, such as a microscopic nick that I can feel but not see, I throw it away and get another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades were a gift for my son.  He wears a beard and only trims so they should do fine.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a safety razor.  I have tried a variety of blades and the Derby are my absolute favorite.  I don&#x27;t get the nicks and cuts like I do with the Merkur blades which are MUCH more expensive.  At less than 10 cents a blade I don&#x27;t feel the least bit guilty changing the blade for every shave.  I was using a Fusion Power at almost $4.00 a cartridge and they barely lasted a week before they were dull and causing razor burn.  The Derby 100 count box comes in individual packages of 5 blades so they are easy to manage.  The only negative thing I can say is the pack does not have a used blade slot but for the price I am not complaining.  I purchased the OLFA 1064415 DC-4 Blade Disposal Case from Amazon for my used blades.  The case is reusable and only $7.23.</li>
            <li> Been using now for months.  Great shave, not at all harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was individuals in packs of 5.  Needs more environmentally friendly packaging for bulk quantity.</li>
            <li> I have only used one of these blades so far and I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razor shaving. This beats by far the other two blades I have tried. I used this first blade for the 5th time this morning and it still outperforms the others I tried. It is very comfortable ( no pulling, almost no cuts), very close, long lasting shave. I seem to be able to shave faster with this blade but maybe I am just getting better at it. The way this morning&#x27;s shave felt, I may get one or two more shaves with this first blade.</li>
            <li> there is no comparison between the disposable razor and Derby Blades....fanatastic shave!  The price is very reasonable and the delivery was fast. Want a great shave, try Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Derby Extra is without a doubt the best of all that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get minimal nicks with this, it shaves well and has less irritation than some of the others. And the price simply cannot be beat for so many. One razor lasts me around 4-5 shaves. You do the math, that is a huge cost savings, particularly if you are used to using Gillette Sensor or one of the other expensive cartridges. You will get a nice shave with Derby and it won&#x27;t cut you all to hell. Get yourself a nice shave cream (Proraso or Col Conk), use a badger or boar hair brush to apply it, recommend a Merkur double edge and put a Derby razor in there, and you will get an awesome shave for much less money. And you will be doing it the old style. Then, when you are done, apply some nice Pinaud after shave and you are off in style..</li>
            <li> Seriously I switched to the safety blade razor over a year ago, from the Mach 3. I get the same shave, or 13221654x less the price of the Mach 3 blades. Make the switch, what a rip off the Mach 3 is!</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I ever bought when I started wet shaving with a double edged razor, and in all honesty, I have never used another brand. I can not compare these to the other brands out there, however I have not had to order any new blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave as often as some others do. I do however like not spending a stupid amount of money on shaving supplies. This being said, I purchased these blades about one year ago, and have not even gotten through a quarter of them. I do use the same blade more than once (three times maximum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your just getting into wet shaving, or are looking for an alternative to mainstream multi-blade systems, these are where you need to start!</li>
            <li> Saves me loads of money over all the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; razors.  I can easily get  five shaves out of one blade, and if I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cost of replacing the blade too soon.  It helps you slow down and pay attention to what you are doing while shaving, but it&#x27;s the beauty of using badger &amp; blade to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as sharp as Feather brand, but it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Great starter blade to master your technique. After I improved my passes as well as lathering I ended up moving on to the Feather blades. Every face is different but you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Im so happy! I&#x27;m stocked up for the next few years at a sickening low price!!!! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!! these blades are really good as long as you use proper shave soap and keep your face wet! I recommend to avoid your shave gel in a can. I had a miserable shave.</li>
            <li> Nice shave, usualy last 4 shaves - nice and sharp but not overly aggressive.</li>
            <li> These are a really good deal. First the razors are really thin and sharp. And the quantity that you receive is great</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for almost two years.  Previously I have been able to get a week of shaves with a single razor (most recently Wilson Swords (?)).  I get maybe three days from these.  I&#x27;m glad I got a brick of 100 razors with this order.  I&#x27;m going through them faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Good bade for everyday use or beginning the wet shave experience!! i still use these blades , but no i stepped up to the feathers . much sharper and a cleaner cut. They are also double the price! derby is my everyday and feather is my weekend blade!!</li>
            <li> I buy these by the hundred all the time and give them away with every razor I sell &amp; to friends. Very nice smooth blade and an excellent value.</li>
            <li> For the price these can&#x27;t be beat.  I know a lot of people complain about them on here but honestly they work great for me.  I shave every single day (in the military so I have to) and these last about a week at a time.  I would say I&#x27;ve got a fairly normal beard so it&#x27;s not super thick but definitely not super thin either.  They work great and are a great price.  This pack should last me for quite a while!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derbys fore quite some time now usually with disposable straight razor type so, when I started to look at safety razor I gave these a try. They&#x27;re not the sharpest but, they are the most forgiving and comfortable. Stop spending the big bucks on cartage razor and use these if you want a close comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li> As forgiving and non-aggressive as they come. My DE89 came with a pack so I gave them a try. No razor burn but not a very close shave either. Good first blade for noobies to practice their technique before moving on to a sharper blade.</li>
