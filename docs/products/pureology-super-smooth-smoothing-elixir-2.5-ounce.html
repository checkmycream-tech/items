            <li> It eliminates the need for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same item I usually buy at my salon, but it costs less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this product does NOT way hair down.</li>
            <li> a charm- only a few small drops needed for my long, color treated hair and it smooths and shines my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I put in my hair and blow it dry</li>
            <li> I use a dime size amount on my short but extremely thick, extremely coarse, colored hair and I never have a problem with frizz</li>

            <li> I would recommend to other amazon buyers.</li>
            <li> Blow dry with round brush or use strait iron.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Put a very small amount in the palm of your hand, rub hands together, then apply to damp hair.</li>
            <li> Increasingly hard to find!</li>
            <li> Since, June 28, 2013 I refused the package, because by the size, I can tell that was a WRONG</li>

            <li> Thank you! This product is my favorite!!! Increasingly hard to find!</li>
            <li> It worked great. I would recommend to other amazon buyers.</li>
            <li> This  product works great on curly hair and i love the smell. it makes my hair very soft. Shipping was fast and product as described.</li>
            <li> I use a dime size amount on my short but extremely thick, extremely coarse, colored hair and I never have a problem with frizz AND my hair actually feels soft but not oily.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I like so many, have tried every product on the market. I have wavy, frizzy hair. I use the shampoo, conditioner, friz control, blowout my hair and it is beautifully straight all day. No heat like irons needed and your hair is healthier. A must have for and hair product collector.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology Super Smooth Elixer!  My hair is frizzy if I don&#x27;t use it.  It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or weigh it down.  This is exactly the same item I usually buy at my salon, but it costs less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d it in a couple of days - my hair is fine and this is great especially when you are blow drying!</li>
            <li> Unless you want to wander around reeking of floral scent, avoid these products.  I had used this previously, and liked the way it worked.  However, they have revised the formula, it now contains salycates, which can cause allergic reactions.  I wont&#x27; buy it again.</li>
            <li> The only product I use now to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> This product was a gift for my daughter - she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have a huge collection of hair products purchased in hopes of softening and smoothing my wavy thick hair..  This one does everything I could wish for.  It is definitely worth the price.  Now I want to try the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I wish it was not discontinued.  Buy it up while its still around ;) It makes your hair shine so you look like a fashion princess</li>
