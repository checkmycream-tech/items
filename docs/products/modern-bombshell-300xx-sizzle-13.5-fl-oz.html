            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And the tingle factor was always perfect, hot, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing results</li>
            <li>This lotion works wonders and the sizzle is amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice in a 450 bed and the change is amazing.</li>
            <li>It really takes in the UV and leaves your skin moisturized and looking awesome!</li>
            <li>however, it did come wiht an additional trial lotion which was nice.</li>
            <li>and she is ALWAYS helpful and nice</li>
            <li>Smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>Does everything she wants it to as a bronzer and this is the best price out there on the market.</li>
            <li>The scent is called rose berry.</li>
            <li>the smell is just suppose to be like a rose blossom</li>
            <li>I tried it one time and it smells good but does not get hot at all !!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to experienced tanners who want to achieve a deeper darker tan!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! :)</li>
            <li>it has a very strong tingle.</li>
            <li>i am so happy with my purchase, thank you sooooo much!!</li>
            <li>but this is even better and even has a nice aroma to it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I would easily recommend this Product!</li>
            <li>The smell is also amazing, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this lotion being that it says 300XX the tingle.</li>
            <li>recommend this lotion :)</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the glow it leaves you after tanning.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I get nervous buying tanning lotions online but just read up reviews from the buyers... :)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I tried this lotion that I was able to feel anything</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this lotion as well as</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t even tingle, and it was runnier than most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>and she said it is one of her top 3 tanning lotions</li>
            <li>It is streaky, and to add to all that my fingers are turning orange and that&#x27;s after washing my hands many times after tanning and taking two showers I am turning orange in between my fingers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I plan on ordering more</li>
            <li>I needed something to take me to the next level and this was excellent</li>
            <li>but now I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle and results.</li>
            <li>But I love the intensity of the tingle in this lotion.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I would feel the tingle.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself was okay after you got pass the pain.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>Gives great color fast.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the price</li>
            <li>I have ordered so many things from here</li>
            <li>Works better than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for</li>
            <li>This lotion did an ok job I guess.</li>
            <li>I love tingle lotions, the hottter the better, I want it to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>Used this product suppose to have top tingle.</li>
            <li>Does make your skin itchy after as most tinglers do.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my result.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for years and have used many products.</li>
            <li>i have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is always the best.</li>
            <li>I am especially enjoying the modern version of bombshell, it smells much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best tanning lotion yet seriously by this product it is seriously incredibly I highly highly highly recommend it because it is awesome</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great even though it has expired.</li>
            <li>I love a good tingler and this is by far my fave.</li>
            <li>sizzle isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li>The tingle wasn&#x27;t even close to as strong as the Bombshell.</li>
            <li>It was a bit warm, but not close to HOT..</li>
            <li>the bottle would suggest, but I&#x27;m also a pretty experienced tingle tanner, so I might just be really used to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good tanning lotion but the smell gave me a headache, very loud perfumey scent.</li>
            <li>Very hot!</li>
            <li>how great it feels on my skin and there is no gross after-tan odor.  </li>
            <li>NOW MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE A LIGHT TAN,</li>
            <li>I am an experienced tanner, have only used tingle bottles in the five+ years of tanning..</li>
            <li>My tanning salon technicians are very helpful honest and helpful</li>
            <li>is a fantastic product ,  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really great purchase, and with the price I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>The color it gives is incredibly gorgeous, and there&#x27;s no red blotches that most tingle lotions can bring on.</li>
            <li>Not the real lotion!!!</li>
            <li>I can find lotions that work just as good and smell nice too for half the price.</li>
            <li>was on the fence about this lotion, but as long as you use it in moderation it&#x27;s a great lotion</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>I used the original bombshell and was a fan</li>
            <li>PREFER THE ORIGINAL SIZZLE BOMBSHELL,BUT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT BAD,JUST NOT AS TINGELLY</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product .</li>
            <li>used the orginal bombshell, which I still love, but Modern Bombshell is one ahead!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells like powder and a clean scent but</li>
            <li>The original bombshell is by far way better!</li>
            <li>I was able to get the Modern Bombshell at a huge discount from Amazon compared to what is sales for in the salons.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this lotion I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and tans you as expected</li>
            <li>I came out of the tanning bed bright red and for the rest of the day (went tanning in the morning)</li>
            <li>i turned bright red.</li>
            <li>The lotion that was in the packet that I purchased was white in color, and smelled okay not really bad/but not the best.</li>
            <li>I bought a sample pack of modern bombshell at my tanning salon and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>most of all it tans you fast.</li>
            <li>Great for a dark mousturied tan.</li>
            <li>I have very olive skin, tan very easily and have used many different lotions with bronzers over the years but never had results like this.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it and would recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li>but anyway I do love this product I&#x27;ve acheieved a very dark sexy tan very quickly even after the first application I saw immediate results!</li>
            <li>It does burn and itch a little when applied, but that is part of what gives you great color.  </li>
            <li>It did make it much hotter and turned my skin bright red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for people that tan often and has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about designer skin lotions</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth price you pay.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and the price for the item.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it if you like tingle lotions.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li>IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>I knew right away</li>
            <li>but it will be the blonde and not the modern for sure!</li>
            <li>but no where near as strong.</li>
            <li>Be warned: not for sensitive skin or those who burn easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought multiple samples from my local tanning salon, and I was always happy with my results.</li>
            <li>I went to the salon, and asked to see their bottle of modern bombshell, and the color was light pink, and very strong smelling..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as Rasta Hot (my old favorite tingle), but it produces a deeper color.</li>
            <li>When in the tanning salon it is white and the smell is stronger, and the tingle is super strong.</li>
            <li>and Id have to say this is my new favorite lotion to use by far!</li>
            <li>Make sure not to leave any lines of extra lotion, you will have those lines darker than the rest.</li>
            <li>and I got SO much darker than I did with the Risque lotion that I had been using for months!</li>
            <li>I would be willing to  pay about $15.</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of the first Bomb Shell and I Love It.</li>
            <li>Was not even hot like these customers are saying..</li>
            <li>The bottles I received were VERY white in color, and an ok smell.</li>
            <li>This says hot tingle</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like to feel hot and tingly, this is NOT the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it i was shaking because I wasn&#x27;t used to the burn or tingle affect</li>
            <li>after showering my skin felt hot and had a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased tanning lotion via Amazon that was not sealed.</li>
            <li>I usually use the original Bombshell and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>This is just too hot for me.</li>
            <li>The seller took out the real lotion and replaced with something else!</li>
            <li>The product did get me darker with the first use.  </li>
            <li>and your used to really hot tingles.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX first.  </li>
            <li>If I buy buy bombshell again which I will more than likely</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve used this lotion before.</li>
            <li>I only tan in preparation for vacations, but I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It does have a tingle factor so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was getting ripped off</li>
            <li>so I was unsure at first but</li>
            <li>This was NOT Desiner Skin Modern Bombshell 300xx Sizzle!</li>
            <li>Who knows what&#x27;s really in there!?</li>
            <li>or I have a higher tolerance to pain?)</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, moderate heat, not for the inexperienced tanner.</li>
            <li>Definitely on my way to becoming a modern bombshell!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Modern Bombshell.  </li>
            <li>is pretty intense</li>
            <li>The tingle is pretty intense.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used way too much.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt smell as tropical as most but as long as it works as well as</li>
            <li>It does work somewhat, so I actually had to buy another lotion from my salon, spending way more money than I wanted, but between the 2 I have a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>I went to my tanning salon and saw this product there and decided to look it up online since it was very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just threw out my bottle after giving my friends daughter a &amp;#34;henna tattoo&amp;#34; with it the little girl liked how her skin has a orange flower on there</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used modern bombshell from the salon</li>
            <li>My salon sells this for twice as much.  </li>
            <li>It was much cheaper to buy off here then in the salon.  </li>
            <li>but she is very picky about her lotions</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It gives an intense tingle.</li>
            <li>This was too much.</li>
            <li>It really amplified my tan, but I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li>when your done tanning prepare for the sunless tanner smell (which really doesn&#x27;t bother me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too much tingle at all but</li>
            <li>When I ran out of it my tanning salon had stopped carrying it and started selling this Modern Bombshell</li>
            <li>The lotion came in really fast</li>
            <li>It has a very stong bronzer and will turn your skin orange.</li>
            <li>I used to work at a tanning salon where this lotion was sold, I ordered it off line and when I received it I compared it to the modern bombshell 300xx sizzle at the tanning salon and</li>
            <li>Have used this product before and really like but this time I got an expired bottle.</li>
            <li>how fast shipped ..</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this lotion</li>
            <li>I used one of the workers Modern Bombshell before I made my order on here</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But just beware you have to rub it in really well, about a week ago</li>
            <li>you only stay red over night though by the morning it fades to a nice tan.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was smart enough to NOT put it on my whole body!</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST extreme tingle long lasting tanning lotion I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>Tried other lotions in the past and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, it turned my skin very, very orange and left me really blotchy.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no tingle, hot action or anything for me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an amazingly dark sexy tan, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of my favorite lotions</li>
            <li>FOR THE MAIN FACT</li>
            <li>However,  it does get pretty hot with burning sensation so I would suggest only using after tanning for a while</li>
            <li>My boyfriend told me i got super dark, but it wasnt worth it to me..  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it was replaced with, BUT I AM HIGHLY PISSED THAT SOMEONE WOULD SELL ME</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend if u like tinglers.</li>
            <li>BUT IS A HIGH TINGLER</li>
            <li>factor is high if you are beginner Tanner be cautious</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend that you purchase this product.</li>
            <li>and yes I got a lot darker after the high pressure bed I normally do.</li>
            <li>the lotion in the bottle that I received was a light pink.</li>
            <li>and it is indeed suppose to be a light pink color</li>
            <li>and I normally stick to lotions without bronzors, but I purchased this</li>
            <li>but I normal</li>
            <li>Love it, i am a year round tanner in fl</li>
            <li>I normally lay 30 minutes in&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>So just keep in mind when you get a bottle that is normally 70 or 80 dollars for 30  </li>
            <li>you are still getting 30 dollars worth of the actual lotion on the inside.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would be a step up from what I normally use (Designer Skin Bombshell) because Bombshell is 100xx</li>
            <li>I normally use Bomb Shell and thought I would try this new product.</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;ve never seen light pink lotion before I&#x27;ve only seen light brown and white</li>
            <li>Took my tan to a new, darker level.  </li>
            <li>BUT I GOT THE NEW BOMBSHELL</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion was new, but not sealed.</li>
            <li>It is very, VERY tingly, so if you like a moderate tingle this isn&#x27;t for you!</li>
            <li>and yes, it is definitely the real thing at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>and this is actually the first time I&#x27;ve been screwed over.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this lotion and can&#x27;t believe how dark I got after only 17 minutes in the bed!</li>
            <li>&amp; I started to notice several dark spots from where i missed getting some off my hands &amp; didnt rub it all in &amp; on the top of my foot and now in my wrist</li>
            <li>Shipped fine, but arrived later than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go with the original bombshell also by designer skin; it just has a lighter tingle and less bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the other tingle bronzers</li>
            <li>been tanning for a few months now good product in the beginning after 2 weeks of use little</li>
            <li>I was alright with the color until the salon I go to recently put in a high pressure bed and now the tan is really dark and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I just made a wild guess on it</li>
            <li>Still have the whole bottle from last year.  </li>
            <li>I have been tanning for a long time, this was the first tingle i got.</li>
            <li>WOW THIS LOTION IS OFF THE CHART.</li>
            <li>But your definitely not getting the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion only once or twice a week because it really burns the hell out of your skin.</li>
            <li>your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I inquired about it to my salon professional (as if I had bought it there) and she explained to me that it indeed had a self tanner in it</li>
            <li>so I cannot say whether this is for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The last thing and it kind of sucks</li>
            <li>If you like tingler lotions, this one is hot but not too hot and I am tan after only a few visits.</li>
            <li>, I get super dark!</li>
            <li>Would put it on before I went tanning cause only live 3 blocks from salon....</li>
            <li>I recently ventured into the world of tingle lotions by first buying and trying several different levels of tingle.</li>
            <li>Just like every other tingler it leaves you pretty red right after you tan, but that dies down within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>the tingle I could barely feel</li>
            <li>IS YOUR NATURAL COLOR LASTING LONGER.</li>
            <li>GOT DARK VERY QUICK..GOOD QUALITY!</li>
            <li>The only way I will is if It is directly from the company itself for the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Bought two of these bottles, came in a very fast time, actually two days earlier than expected time limit.</li>
            <li>The reddening is extreme and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watered down and runny</li>
            <li>At first I was a little nervous, but turns out that after only two tanning visits (uses of the lotion) I can see a change in my skin and am turning brown.</li>
            <li>Reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the modern bombshell does leave a slight smell afterwards from the bronzers.</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a decent lotion if you can take extreme tingles !</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And the tingle factor was always perfect, hot, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing results</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders and the sizzle is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice in a 450 bed and the change is amazing.</li>
            <li> It really takes in the UV and leaves your skin moisturized and looking awesome!</li>
            <li> however, it did come wiht an additional trial lotion which was nice.</li>
            <li> and she is ALWAYS helpful and nice</li>
            <li> Smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Does everything she wants it to as a bronzer and this is the best price out there on the market.</li>
            <li> The scent is called rose berry.</li>
            <li> the smell is just suppose to be like a rose blossom</li>
            <li> I tried it one time and it smells good but does not get hot at all !!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to experienced tanners who want to achieve a deeper darker tan!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! :)</li>
            <li> it has a very strong tingle.</li>
            <li> i am so happy with my purchase, thank you sooooo much!!</li>
            <li> but this is even better and even has a nice aroma to it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I would easily recommend this Product!</li>
            <li> The smell is also amazing, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this....</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this lotion being that it says 300XX the tingle.</li>
            <li> recommend this lotion :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the glow it leaves you after tanning.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I get nervous buying tanning lotions online but just read up reviews from the buyers... :)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I tried this lotion that I was able to feel anything</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this lotion as well as</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t even tingle, and it was runnier than most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> and she said it is one of her top 3 tanning lotions</li>
            <li> It is streaky, and to add to all that my fingers are turning orange and that&#x27;s after washing my hands many times after tanning and taking two showers I am turning orange in between my fingers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I plan on ordering more</li>
            <li> I needed something to take me to the next level and this was excellent</li>
            <li> but now I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle and results.</li>
            <li> But I love the intensity of the tingle in this lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I would feel the tingle.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself was okay after you got pass the pain.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> Gives great color fast.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the price</li>
            <li> I have ordered so many things from here</li>
            <li> Works better than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for</li>
            <li> This lotion did an ok job I guess.</li>
            <li> I love tingle lotions, the hottter the better, I want it to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> Used this product suppose to have top tingle.</li>
            <li> Does make your skin itchy after as most tinglers do.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my result.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and have used many products.</li>
            <li> i have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is always the best.</li>
            <li> I am especially enjoying the modern version of bombshell, it smells much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> best tanning lotion yet seriously by this product it is seriously incredibly I highly highly highly recommend it because it is awesome</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great even though it has expired.</li>
            <li> I love a good tingler and this is by far my fave.</li>
            <li> sizzle isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li> The tingle wasn&#x27;t even close to as strong as the Bombshell.</li>
            <li> It was a bit warm, but not close to HOT..</li>
            <li> the bottle would suggest, but I&#x27;m also a pretty experienced tingle tanner, so I might just be really used to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tanning lotion but the smell gave me a headache, very loud perfumey scent.</li>
            <li> Very hot!</li>
            <li> how great it feels on my skin and there is no gross after-tan odor.  </li>
            <li> NOW MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE A LIGHT TAN,</li>
            <li> I am an experienced tanner, have only used tingle bottles in the five+ years of tanning..</li>
            <li> My tanning salon technicians are very helpful honest and helpful</li>
            <li> is a fantastic product ,  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really great purchase, and with the price I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The color it gives is incredibly gorgeous, and there&#x27;s no red blotches that most tingle lotions can bring on.</li>
            <li> Not the real lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I can find lotions that work just as good and smell nice too for half the price.</li>
            <li> was on the fence about this lotion, but as long as you use it in moderation it&#x27;s a great lotion</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I used the original bombshell and was a fan</li>
            <li> PREFER THE ORIGINAL SIZZLE BOMBSHELL,BUT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT BAD,JUST NOT AS TINGELLY</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product .</li>
            <li> used the orginal bombshell, which I still love, but Modern Bombshell is one ahead!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like powder and a clean scent but</li>
            <li> The original bombshell is by far way better!</li>
            <li> I was able to get the Modern Bombshell at a huge discount from Amazon compared to what is sales for in the salons.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this lotion I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and tans you as expected</li>
            <li> I came out of the tanning bed bright red and for the rest of the day (went tanning in the morning)</li>
            <li> i turned bright red.</li>
            <li> The lotion that was in the packet that I purchased was white in color, and smelled okay not really bad/but not the best.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack of modern bombshell at my tanning salon and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li> most of all it tans you fast.</li>
            <li> Great for a dark mousturied tan.</li>
            <li> I have very olive skin, tan very easily and have used many different lotions with bronzers over the years but never had results like this.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it and would recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> but anyway I do love this product I&#x27;ve acheieved a very dark sexy tan very quickly even after the first application I saw immediate results!</li>
            <li> It does burn and itch a little when applied, but that is part of what gives you great color.  </li>
            <li> It did make it much hotter and turned my skin bright red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for people that tan often and has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about designer skin lotions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth price you pay.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and the price for the item.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you like tingle lotions.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> I knew right away</li>
            <li> but it will be the blonde and not the modern for sure!</li>
            <li> but no where near as strong.</li>
            <li> Be warned: not for sensitive skin or those who burn easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple samples from my local tanning salon, and I was always happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon, and asked to see their bottle of modern bombshell, and the color was light pink, and very strong smelling..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as Rasta Hot (my old favorite tingle), but it produces a deeper color.</li>
            <li> When in the tanning salon it is white and the smell is stronger, and the tingle is super strong.</li>
            <li> and Id have to say this is my new favorite lotion to use by far!</li>
            <li> Make sure not to leave any lines of extra lotion, you will have those lines darker than the rest.</li>
            <li> and I got SO much darker than I did with the Risque lotion that I had been using for months!</li>
            <li> I would be willing to  pay about $15.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the first Bomb Shell and I Love It.</li>
            <li> Was not even hot like these customers are saying..</li>
            <li> The bottles I received were VERY white in color, and an ok smell.</li>
            <li> This says hot tingle</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to feel hot and tingly, this is NOT the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it i was shaking because I wasn&#x27;t used to the burn or tingle affect</li>
            <li> after showering my skin felt hot and had a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased tanning lotion via Amazon that was not sealed.</li>
            <li> I usually use the original Bombshell and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> This is just too hot for me.</li>
            <li> The seller took out the real lotion and replaced with something else!</li>
            <li> The product did get me darker with the first use.  </li>
            <li> and your used to really hot tingles.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX first.  </li>
            <li> If I buy buy bombshell again which I will more than likely</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve used this lotion before.</li>
            <li> I only tan in preparation for vacations, but I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It does have a tingle factor so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was getting ripped off</li>
            <li> so I was unsure at first but</li>
            <li> This was NOT Desiner Skin Modern Bombshell 300xx Sizzle!</li>
            <li> Who knows what&#x27;s really in there!?</li>
            <li> or I have a higher tolerance to pain?)</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, moderate heat, not for the inexperienced tanner.</li>
            <li> Definitely on my way to becoming a modern bombshell!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Modern Bombshell.  </li>
            <li> is pretty intense</li>
            <li> The tingle is pretty intense.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used way too much.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt smell as tropical as most but as long as it works as well as</li>
            <li> It does work somewhat, so I actually had to buy another lotion from my salon, spending way more money than I wanted, but between the 2 I have a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> I went to my tanning salon and saw this product there and decided to look it up online since it was very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just threw out my bottle after giving my friends daughter a &amp;#34;henna tattoo&amp;#34; with it the little girl liked how her skin has a orange flower on there</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used modern bombshell from the salon</li>
            <li> My salon sells this for twice as much.  </li>
            <li> It was much cheaper to buy off here then in the salon.  </li>
            <li> but she is very picky about her lotions</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It gives an intense tingle.</li>
            <li> This was too much.</li>
            <li> It really amplified my tan, but I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> when your done tanning prepare for the sunless tanner smell (which really doesn&#x27;t bother me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too much tingle at all but</li>
            <li> When I ran out of it my tanning salon had stopped carrying it and started selling this Modern Bombshell</li>
            <li> The lotion came in really fast</li>
            <li> It has a very stong bronzer and will turn your skin orange.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon where this lotion was sold, I ordered it off line and when I received it I compared it to the modern bombshell 300xx sizzle at the tanning salon and</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and really like but this time I got an expired bottle.</li>
            <li> how fast shipped ..</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this lotion</li>
            <li> I used one of the workers Modern Bombshell before I made my order on here</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But just beware you have to rub it in really well, about a week ago</li>
            <li> you only stay red over night though by the morning it fades to a nice tan.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was smart enough to NOT put it on my whole body!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST extreme tingle long lasting tanning lotion I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Tried other lotions in the past and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it turned my skin very, very orange and left me really blotchy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no tingle, hot action or anything for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an amazingly dark sexy tan, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of my favorite lotions</li>
            <li> FOR THE MAIN FACT</li>
            <li> However,  it does get pretty hot with burning sensation so I would suggest only using after tanning for a while</li>
            <li> My boyfriend told me i got super dark, but it wasnt worth it to me..  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was replaced with, BUT I AM HIGHLY PISSED THAT SOMEONE WOULD SELL ME</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend if u like tinglers.</li>
            <li> BUT IS A HIGH TINGLER</li>
            <li> factor is high if you are beginner Tanner be cautious</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend that you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> and yes I got a lot darker after the high pressure bed I normally do.</li>
            <li> the lotion in the bottle that I received was a light pink.</li>
            <li> and it is indeed suppose to be a light pink color</li>
            <li> and I normally stick to lotions without bronzors, but I purchased this</li>
            <li> but I normal</li>
            <li> Love it, i am a year round tanner in fl</li>
            <li> I normally lay 30 minutes in&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> So just keep in mind when you get a bottle that is normally 70 or 80 dollars for 30  </li>
            <li> you are still getting 30 dollars worth of the actual lotion on the inside.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would be a step up from what I normally use (Designer Skin Bombshell) because Bombshell is 100xx</li>
            <li> I normally use Bomb Shell and thought I would try this new product.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;ve never seen light pink lotion before I&#x27;ve only seen light brown and white</li>
            <li> Took my tan to a new, darker level.  </li>
            <li> BUT I GOT THE NEW BOMBSHELL</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion was new, but not sealed.</li>
            <li> It is very, VERY tingly, so if you like a moderate tingle this isn&#x27;t for you!</li>
            <li> and yes, it is definitely the real thing at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> and this is actually the first time I&#x27;ve been screwed over.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this lotion and can&#x27;t believe how dark I got after only 17 minutes in the bed!</li>
            <li> &amp; I started to notice several dark spots from where i missed getting some off my hands &amp; didnt rub it all in &amp; on the top of my foot and now in my wrist</li>
            <li> Shipped fine, but arrived later than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go with the original bombshell also by designer skin; it just has a lighter tingle and less bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the other tingle bronzers</li>
            <li> been tanning for a few months now good product in the beginning after 2 weeks of use little</li>
            <li> I was alright with the color until the salon I go to recently put in a high pressure bed and now the tan is really dark and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I just made a wild guess on it</li>
            <li> Still have the whole bottle from last year.  </li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a long time, this was the first tingle i got.</li>
            <li> WOW THIS LOTION IS OFF THE CHART.</li>
            <li> But your definitely not getting the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion only once or twice a week because it really burns the hell out of your skin.</li>
            <li> your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I inquired about it to my salon professional (as if I had bought it there) and she explained to me that it indeed had a self tanner in it</li>
            <li> so I cannot say whether this is for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The last thing and it kind of sucks</li>
            <li> If you like tingler lotions, this one is hot but not too hot and I am tan after only a few visits.</li>
            <li> , I get super dark!</li>
            <li> Would put it on before I went tanning cause only live 3 blocks from salon....</li>
            <li> I recently ventured into the world of tingle lotions by first buying and trying several different levels of tingle.</li>
            <li> Just like every other tingler it leaves you pretty red right after you tan, but that dies down within an hour or so.</li>
            <li> the tingle I could barely feel</li>
            <li> IS YOUR NATURAL COLOR LASTING LONGER.</li>
            <li> GOT DARK VERY QUICK..GOOD QUALITY!</li>
            <li> The only way I will is if It is directly from the company itself for the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these bottles, came in a very fast time, actually two days earlier than expected time limit.</li>
            <li> The reddening is extreme and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watered down and runny</li>
            <li> At first I was a little nervous, but turns out that after only two tanning visits (uses of the lotion) I can see a change in my skin and am turning brown.</li>
            <li> Reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the modern bombshell does leave a slight smell afterwards from the bronzers.</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s a decent lotion if you can take extreme tingles !</li>
            <li> Not recomended until a good base tan has developed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I like my lotions really hot</li>
            <li> The tingle sensation is totally bareable and doesnt last too long either!</li>
            <li> im not sure this is even the real product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used bombshell in the past and this was not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning 3x&#x27;s a week for the past two months, I developed a great base tan...</li>
            <li> a little early cause</li>
            <li> I got it almost a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> But that is minor.</li>
            <li> Wow what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The tinlgle opens up your pores, and allows you to get a deeper tan, and it didn&#x27;t seem as if I needed to tan as much, or as long.  </li>
            <li> I was in the bed for five minutes when I started to feel strange.</li>
            <li> It has an awful perfume smell, nothing at all like the old &amp;#34;tanning, coconutty smell&amp;#34; Bombshell and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good.</li>
            <li> I thought she was as dark as she could possibly get</li>
            <li> I got sooo dark using this after only 3 sessions tanning!!</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be way worse with this lotion, but I was still willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> , HOWEVER I feel like I&#x27;ve been rubbed down with tiny shards of fiberglass.</li>
            <li> bed, I couldn&#x27;t feel the tingle till about 9mins in, and even then it was only slight...</li>
            <li> I only used half the sample packet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does have a slight self tanning scent (after a couple hours), but not enough to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> When I used it, I found it extremely runny compared to normal lotion and had a sort of weird smell like old people soap or something.</li>
            <li> to no tingle bronzer isnt bad in it but def using a better product</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived sooner than was expected</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s expected though.</li>
            <li> ,it is pink and smell&#x27;s like baby lotion,it has no tingle.</li>
            <li> So she had also recommended pink diamond,</li>
            <li> but it is pink?</li>
            <li> The second thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell after it had been on for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> No tingle at all an have to be careful putting it on cause</li>
            <li> Helps get  that dark brown color in only a few appilcations.</li>
            <li> I hope you love the smell of dirty ass and pretzels because after your out of the tanning bed everyone knows where u were at!</li>
            <li> Plus try mixing it with other indoor lotions as well.  </li>
            <li> I found it extremely underwhelming.</li>
            <li> and I should apply way less to my body than with other products; also to apply it in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> THAT THE BRONZER IS WHAT MAKES U LOOK DARK</li>
            <li> and I get beyond dark with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it is not nearly as powerful as it claims..</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering Modern Bombshell again.</li>
            <li> I started off with Black &amp; Tan</li>
            <li> but this tingle is stronger with less bronzers.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work half way.</li>
            <li> If your not to crazy about hot</li>
            <li> I knew from previous experiences with tingle lotions, a little goes a lonnnnnng way...</li>
            <li> so I applied a quarter size amount to each leg &amp; a little less on the arms...</li>
            <li> so I applied a little of the black &amp; tan to those areas...</li>
            <li> Even putting lotion on there do not wear tight clothes</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this lotion.</li>
            <li> You should try to leave it on a few hours before taking a shower to let the bronzer set.</li>
            <li> It smells just like an everyday lotion, not a tanning lotion,</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion a few months ago bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these bottles were watered down, or altered, but that&#x27;s what I believe happened..</li>
            <li> I seriously wonder if it was a fraudulent product because I&#x27;ve used other Bombshells</li>
            <li> But when I got out to the car I could really feel the tingle, it wasn&#x27;t bad though.</li>
            <li> I bought it from the salon, paid almost 80 dollars, and it was really streaky, and the color it gave looked like I got a really bad spray tan.</li>
            <li> Similar to using a fake tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I hated this, I got a free sample with luminary I purchased and so tried it.</li>
            <li> instead so I bought a small packet of it to try</li>
            <li> Not sure I will</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to do this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that at least four out of five times that I used it.</li>
            <li> but, when I used it I was very angry knowing that this is not the actual lotion in the bottle</li>
            <li> I was starting to sweat bad...</li>
            <li> I am red all over and burning so bad</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money on this one !!!</li>
            <li> IT ALSO HAS A STREAKY LOOK WHEN USED THE SECOND WEEK, AFTER SWITCHING TO A BASE TANNING LOTION WITH NO BRONZE TO LET MY SKIN RECOOPERATE</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used lotions that smell a lot worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any tingle is uncomfortable (maybe my skin is just thick</li>
            <li> It does have a serious tingle to it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who is a very serious tanner.</li>
            <li> If you like the old Bombshell (pinup girl on bottle), you&#x27;ll HATE this!</li>
            <li> After 1st used I WAS DARK!!!!!</li>
            <li> I could barely feel any tingle, but the results were the worst part.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not I love to look bronze but not like a Carrot!!!</li>
            <li> I also thought it to be weird</li>
            <li> and yes it tingled but nothing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> But what do you do when you get a fake?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t a fake bottle either.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have always been told to be wary about buying tanning products on line.  </li>
            <li> i would have to lay down because my body hurt so incredibly bad!</li>
            <li> but I am mad</li>
            <li> it was fake!</li>
            <li> I suppose I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle I purchased was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Being a Designer Skin Lover, I hate this lotion,I do believe this is a fake</li>
            <li> I buy alot of things from amazon and have never had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I have used lotions with tingle factors before but never one that was this bad.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel like I&#x27;m having a bad reaction</li>
            <li> So I rated y&#x27;all as bad service.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin so badly that I even got heat rash.</li>
            <li> A must try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always order my lotion from Amazon, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed until now.</li>
            <li> I already have a base tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very very mad about this</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible will never use this lotion again..</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Worst customer service.</li>
            <li> The face was the worst.</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the worst either</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this lotion but it after you get out from under the tannin bed, it smells like your skin is burning. I&#x27;ve noticed that at least four out of five times that I used it. Make sure not to leave any lines of extra lotion, you will have those lines darker than the rest. I would recommend it, except for the smell after use.</li>
            <li> Terrible will never use this lotion again.. Would put it on before I went tanning cause only live 3 blocks from salon.... Even putting lotion on there do not wear tight clothes gave me a sports bra tan lines.... If u miss 1 tiny spot u will have a white spot on your skin</li>
            <li> Hot tanning lotion which produces Excellent results in tanning beds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tanning lotion but the smell gave me a headache, very loud perfumey scent. Returned it with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST extreme tingle long lasting tanning lotion I have ever used!!! ❤️❤️ A must try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> I love this product! Arrived on time! So far it&#x27;s working great even though it has expired. Had it not been expired already I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Received my lotion today, When I started to get in tanning bed, I opened lotion &amp; immediately noticed it was \\&quot;White!\\&quot;  NO Bronzer lotion&#x27;s are WHITE in color.  I put it on, &amp; NEVER felt any tingling sensation!!  I also thought it to be weird that I couldn&#x27;t read the writing on the back of the bottle. It was all blurry!  This immediately threw up a red flag!  This IS NOT the lotion that is suppose to be in the bottle....I don&#x27;t know what it was replaced with, BUT I AM HIGHLY PISSED THAT SOMEONE WOULD SELL ME A BOGUS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SHAME SHAME ON YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I already have a base tan and yes it tingled but nothing uncomfortable.I did feel my skin warming up and yes I got a lot darker after the high pressure bed I normally do.I would definitely recommend it for people that tan often and has a nice smell as well.I&#x27;m not crazy about designer skin lotions but this is a good one.love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I have always used Bombshell but this is even better and even has a nice aroma to it.  The shipper did an excellent job in getting it to me.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Fabulous tan and tingle!!!  Tried other lotions in the past and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I have always used bombshell products, but after not tanning for 2 years I decided to step it up and try the 300X. At first I was a little nervous, but turns out that after only two tanning visits (uses of the lotion) I can see a change in my skin and am turning brown. This is coming from a girl that was VERY white! I attribute my instance change to the lotion not to the bed I am using. I am using a basic bed and this lotion is AWESOME!I will always use this lotion when I use an indoor tanning salon. It&#x27;s worth price you pay. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for tanners who love the tingling lotions. Just like every other tingler it leaves you pretty red right after you tan, but that dies down within an hour or so. The smell is also amazing, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning lotion. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived sooner than was expected but I am mad I wasted money on this lotion. It&#x27;s very watered down and runny and I&#x27;ve used modern bombshell from the salon so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. I will not be buying anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love this....After 1st used I WAS DARK!!!!! At 1st did not think it was going to have the tingle, but after 5 min in tanning bed....WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t handle the sizzle...well I don&#x27;t prefer to lol. I don&#x27;t like being seen after I use this stuff because like any sizzler, it makes your skin look &#x27;bumpy&#x27; and red. That&#x27;s expected though. It does seem to boost color afterwards, especially if you mix it with a bronzer. If that is what you&#x27;re looking for I defffinitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this product today and it&#x27;s expired! Ugh... Thought I was saving money. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great buy.  My salon sells this for twice as much.  Of course they claim tanning products purchased online are probably counterfeit or diluted, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.  I have purchased tanning products from Amazon for years and never had a problem.  This is my first time trying Modern Bombshell.  The scent is nice, both before and after tanning!  It does have an accelerator in it (tingle), so be prepared for some intensity if you aren&#x27;t used to that.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and the price for the item.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper to buy off here then in the salon.  I had been using just bronzers up until I got this.  Took my tan to a new, darker level.  It does what it says, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good which is the only reason I gave it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> This tingle/sizzle tanning lotion gets you great color. It does burn and itch a little when applied, but that is part of what gives you great color.  You should try to leave it on a few hours before taking a shower to let the bronzer set.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this lotion being that it says 300XX the tingle. I was using the Australian Gold Risque lotion and the tingle in that is pretty intense so I figured it would be way worse with this lotion, but I was still willing to give it a try. After using this lotion for the first time tonight I must say I am impressed. It smells just like an everyday lotion, not a tanning lotion, the tingle I could barely feel and I got SO much darker than I did with the Risque lotion that I had been using for months! I am in LOVE with this lotion and can&#x27;t believe how dark I got after only 17 minutes in the bed! I would deff. recommend this lotion :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning 3x&#x27;s a week for the past two months, I developed a great base tan...I started off with Black &amp; Tan, it was good too...it&#x27;s just I had reached a point where it didn&#x27;t seem like I was getting any darker. So tonight when I went to tan they had a sample packet of this, I decided I would try it....I knew from previous experiences with tingle lotions, a little goes a lonnnnnng way...so I applied a quarter size amount to each leg &amp; a little less on the arms...I don&#x27;t like applying tingle lotions to my chest/stomach area so I applied a little of the black &amp; tan to those areas...I laid 20mins in a reg. bed, I couldn&#x27;t feel the tingle till about 9mins in, and even then it was only slight...about 16/17mins in I decided to get out a little early cause I was starting to sweat bad...(which I hate lol) But when I got out to the car I could really feel the tingle, it wasn&#x27;t bad though. My skin was flushed looking, and still is it&#x27;s now been about an hour since laying.&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence about this lotion, but as long as you use it in moderation it&#x27;s a great lotion....I would NOT recommend using this on your face though. The lotion that was in the packet that I purchased was white in color, and smelled okay not really bad/but not the best. I only used half the sample packet.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the glow it leaves you after tanning. It really takes in the UV and leaves your skin moisturized and looking awesome!</li>
            <li> I asked for it and I got it...Sizzle!!!  The perfect amount of tingle while I tanned and smells fruity.  Brings the blood to the surface for the deepest tan.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great results and love the scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I HAVE BEEN TANNING FOR  A WHILE AND FELT LIKE I WAS STAYING ONE COLOR BUT I GOT THE NEW BOMBSHELL AND IT WAS AMAZZINNNGG IT SMELLS SO GOOD I STAY RED FOR A WHILE AFTER WORDS BUT THEN IM JUST TAN!!! TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack of modern bombshell at my tanning salon and fell in love with this. I got it almost a week earlier than expected. I used the original bombshell and was a fan but this tingle is stronger with less bronzers. Reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the modern bombshell does leave a slight smell afterwards from the bronzers. Similar to using a fake tanning lotion but no where near as strong. But that is minor. I was not going to pay 89 dollars for this at my tanning salon!!! I do highly recommend if u like tinglers. I buy alot of things from amazon and have never had a bad experience. I get nervous buying tanning lotions online but just read up reviews from the buyers... :)</li>
            <li> I recently ventured into the world of tingle lotions by first buying and trying several different levels of tingle. With the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; tingle I felt nothing at all, same with the \\&quot;medium\\&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t until I tried this lotion that I was able to feel anything but I can really only feel it on the undersides of my arms.  I was also having some problems with all the lotions turning me orange so I bought a bottle of this as well as Luminary.  I really love the smell of this lotion as well as how great it feels on my skin and there is no gross after-tan odor.  This lotion is already helping me break through my tanning plateau.  I got my bottle a day ahead of schedule and yes, it is definitely the real thing at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, it&#x27;s amazing! It works quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the other tingle bronzers</li>
            <li> Smells great and tans you as expected but I feel its a bit pricey. I can find lotions that work just as good and smell nice too for half the price. Salons sell this for $85, amazon sells it for $30...me I would be willing to  pay about $15.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USEING THIS PRODUCT FOR TWO WEEKS NOW AND AM GOING WITH GODESS NEXT TIME FOR THE MAIN FACT THAT THE BRONZER IS WHAT MAKES U LOOK DARK AND WHEN U SHOWER THE NEXT DAY IT COMES OFF. NOW MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE A LIGHT TAN, BASICALLY LIKE HOW IT WAS BEFORE I USED THIS. THIS IS GOOD FOR LIKE AN OCASION THE NEXT DAY IF U DONT SHOWER UNTILL LATER THAT NIGHT. ALSO THE TINGLE MADE ME FEEL FAINTY EVERYTIME DURING THE LAST 2 MINUTES IN THE BOOTH FOR A 10 MIN TAN. IT ALSO HAS A STREAKY LOOK WHEN USED THE SECOND WEEK, AFTER SWITCHING TO A BASE TANNING LOTION WITH NO BRONZE TO LET MY SKIN RECOOPERATE AND THEN GOING BACK TO THIS. I WILL FINISH THE BOTTLE IN HOPES IT WILL LAST ME UNTILL I GET GODDESS TANNING LOTION, WHICH IS ALSO 10 BUCKS CHEEPER ON HERE, AND HAS NO BRONZER BUT IS A HIGH TINGLER TOO. LOOK UP THE REVIEWS FOR THAT. NO WASH OUT COLOR, NO STREAKS, AND YOU TAN IS YOUR NATURAL COLOR LASTING LONGER. WELL, GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Being a Designer Skin Lover, I hate this lotion,I do believe this is a fake,it is pink and smell&#x27;s like baby lotion,it has no tingle. I am a regular user of the first Bomb Shell and I Love It.But what do you do when you get a fake?</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I seriously wonder if it was a fraudulent product because I&#x27;ve used other Bombshells and they were awesome. This one was like putting on a generic baby lotion.</li>
            <li> PREFER THE ORIGINAL SIZZLE BOMBSHELL,BUT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT BAD,JUST NOT AS TINGELLY</li>
            <li> Bought two of these bottles, came in a very fast time, actually two days earlier than expected time limit. I am an experienced tanner, have only used tingle bottles in the five+ years of tanning.. First time I used it, it turned my skin very, very orange and left me really blotchy. Was not even hot like these customers are saying.. It was a bit warm, but not close to HOT.. The bottles I received were VERY white in color, and an ok smell. I went to the salon, and asked to see their bottle of modern bombshell, and the color was light pink, and very strong smelling.. I&#x27;m not sure if these bottles were watered down, or altered, but that&#x27;s what I believe happened.. Also- I messaged the seller and asked if I could receive my money back, and got no response. Will never buy from this seller again.. Worst customer service.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t even tingle, and it was runnier than most tanning lotions. It smells like soap, and there was a defect on the cap. however, it did come wiht an additional trial lotion which was nice.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 5 years now and I normally stick to lotions without bronzors, but I purchased this and it&#x27;s now my favorite lotion! There was a rapid increase in my color even after the first use, but I do not recommend this for a everyday lotion just a color boost! The tingle is great! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Smells great, moderate heat, not for the inexperienced tanner. I got great color! Overall I love it and would recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and even some friends said they loved it! My tanning salon technicians are very helpful honest and helpful only 1 girl there used it and she said it is one of her top 3 tanning lotions and she is ALWAYS helpful and nice but she is very picky about her lotions so I thought she would know best....WRONG!!! So she had also recommended pink diamond, don&#x27;t try that one either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one takes about 10 mins of just shakeing just to make the &amp;#34;sizzle&amp;#34; activate then I hope you love the smell of dirty ass and pretzels because after your out of the tanning bed everyone knows where u were at! I got over that cuz I tan at night and no one sees and or smells me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got over the after smell but I normal wait 6-12 hours after tanning to bathe and I should have just hopped in the shower after tanning to get off the orange and carrot bronzes! It is streaky, and to add to all that my fingers are turning orange and that&#x27;s after washing my hands many times after tanning and taking two showers I am turning orange in between my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it designer skin thinks orange looks Gorgeous but it&#x27;s not I love to look bronze but not like a Carrot!!! I just threw out my bottle after giving my friends daughter a &amp;#34;henna tattoo&amp;#34; with it the little girl liked how her skin has a orange flower on there lol so I guess it made someone happy ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~OTHER OPTIONS~~~&lt;br /&gt;My favorite cheep tanning lotion is cinnabronze! I just made a wild guess on it and I have already gone threw a hole bottle and I plan on ordering more</li>
            <li> Still have the whole bottle from last year.  Purchased another brand. I have tried all kinds of brands of tanning bed lotions.</li>
            <li> The real deal. So much cheaper than the salon. SO MUCH CHEAPER. I love a good tingler and this is by far my fave. I am especially enjoying the modern version of bombshell, it smells much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t a fake bottle either. Totally legit.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.  So, we&#x27;ll be getting it until she doesn&#x27;t like it anymore.  Thank you for your product...</li>
            <li> This says hot tingle 300 xx . I tried it one time and it smells good but does not get hot at all !!! I just wasted my money on this one !!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend and she loved it. The tingle it has was not unbearable gives a good even tan.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion or years and it is my favorite! It gives an intense tingle. If you don&#x27;t like to feel hot and tingly, this is NOT the lotion for you. Do NOT use on your face! Smell is nice too. This is a great price for tis lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Love it, i am a year round tanner in fl I needed something to take me to the next level and this was excellent I just need to find something about this and it&#x27;s really hard to do this is a fantastic product ,  tingle  factor is high if you are beginner Tanner be cautious</li>
            <li> This was too much. Like applying capsaicin cream all over my body. The face was the worst. It really amplified my tan, but I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It does have a serious tingle to it! The first time I used it i was shaking because I wasn&#x27;t used to the burn or tingle affect but now I love it, I get super dark!</li>
            <li> I was alright with the color until the salon I go to recently put in a high pressure bed and now the tan is really dark and there is a huge difference. My only complaint is that I like my lotions really hot and this wasn&#x27;t up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Scent- This lotion smells like powder and a clean scent but when your done tanning prepare for the sunless tanner smell (which really doesn&#x27;t bother me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle- Out of the 20 plus tingles I&#x27;ve tried this one is my favorite. I feel it and I get beyond dark with this stuff. If your not to crazy about hot I&#x27;d go with the original bombshell also by designer skin; it just has a lighter tingle and less bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results- This doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me for nothing. Hands down one of my favorite lotions and I&#x27;ve used over 60.</li>
            <li> Great tanning product. Not too much tingle at all but great tanning results. Great fragrance and texture. Designer skin products are always reliable.</li>
            <li> I hated this, I got a free sample with luminary I purchased and so tried it. Within seconds I was in the shower washing it off. The reddening is extreme and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even after showering my skin felt hot and had a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very hot! Needs more bronzers though!  I will be getting this one again. Great price for a great product! Definitely worth it if you like tingle lotions.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle and results. By far, my favorite indoor tanning product. Be warned: not for sensitive skin or those who burn easily.</li>
            <li> been tanning for a few months now good product in the beginning after 2 weeks of use little to no tingle bronzer isnt bad in it but def using a better product</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best tingle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used... watch out though because if you can&#x27;t handle tingle you&#x27;ll run out of the tanning bed screaming if you use this stuff.  SUPER TINGLE!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion has expired date on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion before so I knew what I was getting. Shipped fine, but arrived later than expected. Also, the lotion was new, but not sealed. This is the first time I have purchased tanning lotion via Amazon that was not sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a tingle lotion before.&lt;br /&gt;The reason this gets 3 stars is because I feel like it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, HOWEVER I feel like I&#x27;ve been rubbed down with tiny shards of fiberglass. I&#x27;ve bathed twice and rubbed conditioner all over my body and it hasn&#x27;t helped a bit.  I am red all over and burning so bad I&#x27;ve been shaking for an hour and I feel like I might vomit....I will never use a tingle lotion again! But like I said I feel like it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I usually use the original Bombshell and I absolutely love it! When I ran out of it my tanning salon had stopped carrying it and started selling this Modern Bombshell instead so I bought a small packet of it to try and I absolutely love it! It is very, VERY tingly, so if you like a moderate tingle this isn&#x27;t for you! But I love the intensity of the tingle in this lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and am in love!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFFF!!!! FAST SHIPPING! GOT DARK VERY QUICK..GOOD QUALITY!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful, came right away</li>
            <li> The lotion came in really fast it smells great but it is pink? Shouldn&#x27;t a Bronzer be brown? And it definitely didn&#x27;t have a tingle to it.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a long time, this was the first tingle i got. My boyfriend told me i got super dark, but it wasnt worth it to me..  I came out of the tanning bed bright red and for the rest of the day (went tanning in the morning) i would have to lay down because my body hurt so incredibly bad!</li>
            <li> i am so happy that i found you on amazon, i love bombshell and i love designer skin products!! i am so happy with my purchase, thank you sooooo much!! i am very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I have used lotions with tingle factors before but never one that was this bad. It burned literally for hours after getting out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> WOW THIS LOTION IS OFF THE CHART. I HAVE TANNED FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER FOUND LOTIONS THAT WORK THIS GOOD. IT IS SO WORTH THE MONEY. THE SALONS WILL CHARGE YOU $65 FOR THIS SAME BOTTLE</li>
            <li> When I ordered the lotion, it was sealed and of the correct color so I&#x27;m assuming it was a legitimate bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The sizzle isn&#x27;t as strong the bottle would suggest, but I&#x27;m also a pretty experienced tingle tanner, so I might just be really used to it.  The color it gives is incredibly gorgeous, and there&#x27;s no red blotches that most tingle lotions can bring on. Overall it&#x27;s a really great purchase, and with the price I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Good product. Does everything she wants it to as a bronzer and this is the best price out there on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is not for me I put this just on my legs and 5 minutes i was roasted. I normally lay 30 minutes in&lt;br /&gt;my tanning bed with this product only 5 . This is just too hot for me.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work half way. It is definetly not the same as in my tanning salon. I knew right away when I bought it, it is like someone took some out and mixed it with BABY LOTION. Yes it still has some of the lotion in it. So if your a beginner tanner it will still work. But your definitely not getting the whole thing. It does work somewhat, so I actually had to buy another lotion from my salon, spending way more money than I wanted, but between the 2 I have a decent lotion. So You literally get what you pay for. So when you see the price is low...it is probably because they fill it with another type of lotion. the lotion in the bottle that I received was a light pink. When in the tanning salon it is white and the smell is stronger, and the tingle is super strong. So just keep in mind when you get a bottle that is normally 70 or 80 dollars for 30  you are still getting 30 dollars worth of the actual lotion on the inside. I won&#x27;t be purchasing anything tanning lotions online again from Amazon. The only way I will is if It is directly from the company itself for the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this lotion I was super excited to try it. I thought for sure I would feel the tingle. However, I feel nothing with this lotion. There&#x27;s no tingle, hot action or anything for me. I was somewhat dissipointed.</li>
            <li> I normally use Bomb Shell and thought I would try this new product. Hate it! It has a very stong bronzer and will turn your skin orange. I have very olive skin, tan very easily and have used many different lotions with bronzers over the years but never had results like this. Stay away from this product unless you like the orange streaky look.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion only once or twice a week because it really burns the hell out of your skin. you only stay red over night though by the morning it fades to a nice tan. The smell reminds me of tide laundry detergent! overall it&#x27;s a decent lotion if you can take extreme tingles !</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who is a very serious tanner. I thought she was as dark as she could possibly get but this lotion took her even darker!! She loves it and says the tingle is awesome. Good stuff ;~)</li>
            <li> best tanning lotion yet seriously by this product it is seriously incredibly I highly highly highly recommend it because it is awesome</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL!  Amazing results</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon where this lotion was sold, I ordered it off line and when I received it I compared it to the modern bombshell 300xx sizzle at the tanning salon and it was fake! The seller took out the real lotion and replaced with something else! I heard of this happening but didn&#x27;t think people would go to such lengths to make $30.00. I suppose I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and really like but this time I got an expired bottle. Not sure I will but it again from this site</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have tried so far. It smells good,goes on nicely,it doesnt tingle to the point of discomfort which I like.and most of all it tans you fast. I would easily recommend this Product!</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion a few months ago bc the girl at the tanning salon reccomended it to me and i thought my body was on fire. Im not exhaggerating. 5-10 mins after i left the tanning salon i turned bright red. it has a very strong tingle. The lotion itself was okay after you got pass the pain. I would never buy this lotion again. I do not reccommend it to anyone who doesnt like a tingling tan lotion. Thank God i didnt use the lotion on any private parts.</li>
            <li> The product did get me darker with the first use.  I have been tanning for 4 months about 3 to 4 times a week.  However,  it does get pretty hot with burning sensation so I would suggest only using after tanning for a while and your used to really hot tingles.  I would recommend the Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX first.  Plus try mixing it with other indoor lotions as well.  The second thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell after it had been on for a few hours.  It smelled like sunless tanning lotion or the Mystic spray tan.  Yuck.  The smell when putting it on was great.  No over powering coconut or tropical smell.  Just smelled like baby lotion.  The last thing and it kind of sucks but some of it does wash off when taking a shower.  I would suggest leaving it on over night.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product . Wow what a waste of money. Runny ...no results..zero tingle..im not sure this is even the real product in the bottle. I have used bombshell in the past and this was not the real deal. Will never order again !</li>
            <li> Love it.... apply litely u won&#x27;t turn orange. It tends to loos tickle just add a dropof water don&#x27;t get pulled into buying the liquiod from salons use water.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a tingler and I knew that when I bought it but I wanted to try it.  I didn&#x27;t like it.  Makes my skin feel like I&#x27;m having a bad reaction but I wasn&#x27;t.  Not pleasurable.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and how fast shipped .. Will shop again ..</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Great deal! we sell this at the salon i work at for $90. Gives great color fast. But dont forget its a tingle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would be a step up from what I normally use (Designer Skin Bombshell) because Bombshell is 100xx and this said it was 300xx. When I used it, I found it extremely runny compared to normal lotion and had a sort of weird smell like old people soap or something. The tingle wasn&#x27;t even close to as strong as the Bombshell. I found it extremely underwhelming. My ankles got all streaky with bronzer because of the runny consistency. I really don&#x27;t like this lotion and it is not nearly as powerful as it claims..</li>
            <li> I used one of the workers Modern Bombshell before I made my order on here and I was pleased with the price but, when I used it I was very angry knowing that this is not the actual lotion in the bottle may be the same color but, not the actual product. I would like to send this back and in return get the proper lotion. I could have been allergic to an ingredient that was placed in this bottle then what!!!! I&#x27;m very very mad about this I have ordered so many things from here and this is actually the first time I&#x27;ve been screwed over. Now I have no money to send this back!!!</li>
            <li> If you like the old Bombshell (pinup girl on bottle), you&#x27;ll HATE this! It has an awful perfume smell, nothing at all like the old &amp;#34;tanning, coconutty smell&amp;#34; Bombshell and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Hello I was suppose to receive my tanning lotion February 28th, 2013. It is now March 4th, 2013 and still have yet to have it. I am not happy with this. So I rated y&#x27;all as bad service. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works better than any tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried. It tingles A LOT but you&#x27;ll definitely see results. Keep away from ur face and eyes. Well hydrating too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for once I&#x27;ve reached a plateau in tanning.  The tinlgle opens up your pores, and allows you to get a deeper tan, and it didn&#x27;t seem as if I needed to tan as much, or as long.  Love that!</li>
            <li> I love Designer Skin products!! This lotion definately gives you a good burning &amp; tingling sensation. But just beware you have to rub it in really well, about a week ago &amp; I started to notice several dark spots from where i missed getting some off my hands &amp; didnt rub it all in &amp; on the top of my foot and now in my wrist so now I&#x27;m stained!!! It looks as if Put on self tanning lotion and it streaked.</li>
            <li> The original bombshell is by far way better! This lotion did an ok job I guess. If I buy buy bombshell again which I will more than likely but it will be the blonde and not the modern for sure!</li>
            <li> I love tingle lotions, the hottter the better, I want it to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I used the orginal bombshell, which I still love, but Modern Bombshell is one ahead! Love it! Try it!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve used this lotion before. I&#x27;ve bought multiple samples from my local tanning salon, and I was always happy with my results. The scent is called rose berry. Not my favorite but it&#x27;s not the worst either, I&#x27;ve used lotions that smell a lot worse. And the tingle factor was always perfect, hot, just the way I like it. Unfortunately, the bottle I purchased was very disappointing. I could barely feel any tingle, but the results were the worst part. It turned my skin orange! I still have discoloration around my fingernails as well as streaks on my wrists, hands, and in between my fingers. I always order my lotion from Amazon, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed until now. I&#x27;m hoping this is a one time occurrence and I won&#x27;t have problems ordering lotion in the future. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering Modern Bombshell again.</li>
            <li> I only tan in preparation for vacations, but I love this lotion. The tingle is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great for a dark mousturied tan. Not recomended until a good base tan has developed. The tingle is pretty intense.</li>
            <li> This lotion came a lot sooner than I thought and it works great smells so good, great tingle Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this lotion. I got sooo dark using this after only 3 sessions tanning!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! :)</li>
            <li> Used this product suppose to have top tingle. What a joke. No tingle at all an have to be careful putting it on cause bronzer stains some areas an not others</li>
            <li> If you like tingler lotions, this one is hot but not too hot and I am tan after only a few visits. Does make your skin itchy after as most tinglers do. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders and the sizzle is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about the product. Amazon did great every step of the way...but I believe the lotion is defective because it doesn&#x27;t tingle..so that&#x27;s why I give it 1 star</li>
            <li> Not the real lotion!!! I compared it to the salons, completely different!</li>
            <li> Great loition.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and great tingle and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an amazingly dark sexy tan, this is the lotion for you. It does have a tingle factor so be aware of that.Helps get  that dark brown color in only a few appilcations.Remember it does tingle so if you can&#x27;t take the heat stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Very Nice !! goodgood</li>
            <li> This is a great self-tanning lotion and the price is outstanding compared to what my tanning salon sells it for.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you love tingle, this is a very good choice. Not for the novice!</li>
            <li> I love it! At first I thought I was getting ripped off cause I&#x27;ve never seen light pink lotion before I&#x27;ve only seen light brown and white and then I thought it smelled kinda like soap so I was unsure at first but the smell is just suppose to be like a rose blossom and it is indeed suppose to be a light pink color, I investigated this stuff lol but anyway I do love this product I&#x27;ve acheieved a very dark sexy tan very quickly even after the first application I saw immediate results! I&#x27;ve been tanning for years now and Id have to say this is my new favorite lotion to use by far! The tingle sensation is totally bareable and doesnt last too long either! I highly recommend to experienced tanners who want to achieve a deeper darker tan!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. I bought it from the salon, paid almost 80 dollars, and it was really streaky, and the color it gave looked like I got a really bad spray tan. I would never use or recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the Modern Bombshell at a huge discount from Amazon compared to what is sales for in the salons.  I have always been told to be wary about buying tanning products on line.  The first time I used it, I used way too much.  My results the next day showed that it obviously had a self tanner in it.  I inquired about it to my salon professional (as if I had bought it there) and she explained to me that it indeed had a self tanner in it and I should apply way less to my body than with other products; also to apply it in a circular motion.  So I did and the results are great.  It does have a slight self tanning scent (after a couple hours), but not enough to stop using it.  I am pleased with my result.</li>
            <li> This was NOT Desiner Skin Modern Bombshell 300xx Sizzle! It was a off-white, liquid dial soap looking and feeling lotion that did not tingle! Luckily I was smart enough to NOT put it on my whole body! Who knows what&#x27;s really in there!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice in a 450 bed and the change is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as Rasta Hot (my old favorite tingle), but it produces a deeper color. I don&#x27;t think any tingle is uncomfortable (maybe my skin is just thick or I have a higher tolerance to pain?) so I cannot say whether this is for people with sensitive skin. Awesome! Definitely on my way to becoming a modern bombshell!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and have used many products. I went to my tanning salon and saw this product there and decided to look it up online since it was very highly recommended. It did make it much hotter and turned my skin bright red and blotchy. It did not help with my already existing tan. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> i have tried a lot of different tanning lotions and this is always the best. it doesnt smell as tropical as most but as long as it works as well as this one does it doesnt bother me!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend that you purchase this product. It did everything that was promised!!! It is an awesome product!!!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I used this today from my tanning salon. It was a sample so I thought I would try it. I was in the bed for five minutes when I started to feel strange. All of the sudden my skin was on FIRE! It literally took just over five minutes for me to look like a lobster. I immediately got out and when home to rinse it off. It burned my skin so badly that I even got heat rash. Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
