            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and my daughter feels &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; when she takes her bubble baths, and I love that it&#x27;s not an overpowering fake-strawberry smell at all.  </li>
            <li>The amount of bubbles isn&#x27;t as great as other bubble baths, but to have a clean ingredient list and wonderful smell, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>grand daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, and it bubbles nicely, but when I received it the soap had leaked out and the cap doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was lovely.  </li>
            <li>My kids absolutely love it</li>
            <li>My kids love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product viscosity is closer to water than to most liquid soaps (Not at all viscous compared to most bubble bath</li>
            <li>It is not drying at all to their skin, which most bubble baths are.  </li>
            <li>can still try to eat them. :)</li>
            <li>I love this bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>This soap makes great bubbles (unlike other organic bubbles) and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, natural ingredients, and very bubbly, need I say more, the kids will love it and best of all natural.</li>
            <li>Nice idea, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like strawberries... and not a lot of bubbles get produced.</li>
            <li>Worth the joy she gets from finally having a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>seem very concentrated; you may need to add more to the bath than you&#x27;d anticipate.</li>
            <li>This in its unadulterated form is a great product which I have used in the past....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bubble bath because it&#x27;s natural and non-drying to your skin.  </li>
            <li>This bubble bath is really fun.</li>
            <li>Although I appreciate the non-chemical concept, and the smell is great, this bubble bath simply does not create enough bubbles for the price.</li>
            <li>It smells good and there are little sparkles in it.</li>
            <li>However, the bubbles weren&#x27;t great and didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that does not break her out.  </li>
            <li>The price from the 100% Pure site is much lower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Few neither good nor bad things that are just nice to know:&lt;br /&gt;Scent does NOT stick around&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, from this seller, the product is very watery, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find bubble bath products with no endocrine-disruptors, so this is a nice find.</li>
            <li>A lot of the more natural bubble baths don&#x27;t produce as much bubbles, but this one works really well, and a little of the bubble bath goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>leaves soft skin, foams up</li>
            <li>I use it on my 16 month old too, and it leaves his skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bubble too much in the tub but enough to wear my daughter</li>
            <li>So far I like it - just a squirt makes lots of bubbles that stick around pretty long.</li>
            <li>We use three small squirts which gives plenty of bubbles for her to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>My little girl has never been able to have a bubble bath due to her skin.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s not a great value for the $, considering it must be mostly water.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away that it was not as thick as it&#x27;s been in the past, and when I poured it into my daughters&#x27; bath, my suspicions were confirmed.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as advertised: short ingredients list, mild scent, makes bubbles, and doesn&#x27;t result in angry skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Used much more than in the past, and hardly any bubbles.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ripped off when I saw the size of the bottle, but I little goes a long way and the bubble last a long time.  </li>

            <li> We are very careful of the products we use for our skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the subtle strawberry scent.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s as thin as water.  </li>

            <li> Love this product! Smells good,  no SLS and works great. Use a sm amount and u will get tons of bubbles!</li>

            <li> bought as a gift. she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;what a great idea to make bubble baths smell like ice cream. :)</li>
            <li> I use as a body wash.  I like the subtle strawberry scent.  BUT, it&#x27;s as thin as water.  If a kid dumped this, it would pour out in a second.  I feel like it&#x27;s not a great value for the $, considering it must be mostly water.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it bubbles nicely, but when I received it the soap had leaked out and the cap doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> I love this bubble bath.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it!  Smells amazing.  I have the vanilla and strawberry shampoos too.</li>
            <li> purchased along with cupcake toothpaste.. it was a good combo</li>
            <li> Smells good, natural ingredients, and very bubbly, need I say more, the kids will love it and best of all natural.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like strawberries... and not a lot of bubbles get produced. The kids didn&#x27;t get tears, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
