            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the best.  </li>
            <li>If you read this and find the best, I&#x27;d like to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Geodeo is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>Smells absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>the deodorant itself smells good but does not keep away the BO!</li>
            <li>but i think everyone does it lol)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>it worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Great shippingnand service</li>
            <li>called the company to compliment them on their product and they were very nice.  </li>
            <li>for me its good for nothing.</li>
            <li>All three are good at preventing odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly rotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But by the end of the day...again... I didn&#x27;t pass my own smell test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No chemicals and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a coupon or anything, but they still were nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought in in autumn, so I have not tested it in the warm weather yet.  </li>
            <li>just the warm up...</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant around.  </li>
            <li>But there have been days where I have overdressed or exercised and got hot and perspired a great deal - I did detect a bit of odor by the evening then.  </li>
            <li>I will not be able to trust this in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>: okay i gave it weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; type deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to give it a chance to see if it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>But to me it is okay to reapply ...</li>
            <li>Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>the smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I do not have strong body odor</li>
            <li>I smelled the scented ones and thought they might be too strong, but after using them I discovered they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, this deodorant smells great until you actually use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite part...very fruity and fresh.</li>
            <li>For me this causes no irritation which is great but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>But I wanted an aluminum free deodorant and this one suffices.</li>
            <li>It gets better immediately, but that first turn is hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, like the unique colored packaging.  </li>
            <li>I went back to using Lafes roll-on, which is still the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Smells great when you open it but smell disappears right when you put it on.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t smell sickeningly sweet all day.</li>
            <li>But fair warning, 24 hours later I stink, so you just use it every 24 hours or else!</li>
            <li>But after about 3 weeks, i was able to go the whole day without any odor.</li>
            <li>You are lucky if this stuff lasts you 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance was nice but barely there</li>
            <li>And seriously...I really do live the scent. :)</li>
            <li>Also I put on a good amount, and let it dry before I put my shirt on.  </li>
            <li>, it is very light, it has a hint of tea scent, but not heavy with that cloying sweetness of coconut that is so often attributed to &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>But then some days are better and it is fine until the next day.  </li>
            <li>Most of the natural deodorant brands make you stink around noon.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this at all unless you just want a container of something nice to open up and smell once in awhile.  </li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients are organic, most are naturally derived.  </li>
            <li>Like most natural deoderant I have tried you have to reapply.</li>
            <li>have winter weather right now</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant that I have tried and I love it.</li>
            <li>since I thought it would be more of a tropical pina colada scent -- it was more like a somewhat odd grapefruit type smell.  </li>
            <li>Island scent really smelled too sweet at first.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine being out on a hot summer day sweating profusely and trying to use this.  </li>
            <li>Well, I need to reapply if I use it first thing when I wake up, then again in the evening if I am going out.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is exactly that, it deodorizes.</li>
            <li>so I tend to get pretty sweaty.</li>
            <li>great scent, and long lasting too.</li>
            <li>However, that is where the positive ends.  </li>
            <li>The only time I had strong BO that this deodorant did not help with was when I was skiing or day 2</li>
            <li>Otherwise.. I could forget to put some on in the morning and not smell strongly by the end of the day (after using the deodorant for several months).</li>
            <li>I think the whole &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; aspect to it is what causes this.</li>
            <li>Like I said I don&#x27;t sweat much</li>
            <li>like i said i dont sweat much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire much, so that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>I also do not sweat that much.</li>
            <li>The real test will be a summer in Florida and My Christmas Vacation to Trinidad.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep you smell free for long.</li>
            <li>This was the first natural deodorant I tried</li>
            <li>During the detox phase, i did notice that i was able to smell a slight odor.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell, and I like how the deodorant goes on and isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
            <li>I should mention that I have been wearing this deodorant for a few weeks, but it has just recently started getting more hot and humid here so the deodorant is showing its weakness.  </li>
            <li>Not sure about the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; aspect-- or if it might work better with longer use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different deodorant products that are natural and this one certainly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhat negative: the top is hard to get off, andthere is a cap-thing which is stuck inside the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress this enough: this deodorant is absolutely AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day I stopped using this deodorant, all of the issues I was having disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant because of the aluminum in the antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;d still avoid them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my least favorite, but it does work</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it at my last trip to Whole Foods</li>
            <li>and I definitely had a &#x27;detox&#x27; period where it did not work very well.</li>
            <li>The strange thing about this deodorant is that it didn&#x27;t work for the first week...  </li>
            <li>If you reapply it, it will get better for a little while, but who wants to go around reapplying deodorant every little bit.  </li>
            <li>This natural deodorant uses crystals which apparently work quite well.</li>
            <li>Please note, natural deodorants work differently from person to person based on their makeup.  </li>
            <li>I found this deodorant on clearance at my local natural food/product store, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I only use deodorants with natural ingredients, and was looking forward to trying this one.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands.</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle and it helps keep irritation down by using it off and on.</li>
            <li>I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O.</li>
            <li>im not sure if the b.o. is strong enough for other people to smell</li>

            <li> I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O.</li>
            <li> im not sure if the b.o. is strong enough for other people to smell</li>
            <li> It does not stop you from sweating, nor does any other natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Also, the first time you use it, it&#x27;s hard to turn the stick.  </li>
            <li> And, well, its hard to keep smelling pretty after camping.</li>
            <li> In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sticky texture even when dry and the fragrance is similar to the odor of rotting fruit.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least a week, sometimes 3-4, for your body to completely adjust to a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I liked everything about it except the fact that it doesn&#x27;t serve its purpose to keep odor under control.  </li>
            <li> I have had friends that have used Geodeo and not liked it as much as me.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a long day, you might make it to the end.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This one and Tom&#x27;s are about equal.  If you&#x27;ve had a long day, you might make it to the end.  I stress might.  I&#x27;m still searching for the best.  If you read this and find the best, I&#x27;d like to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress this enough: this deodorant is absolutely AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it makes you smell worse than you did before putting it on and you sweat so much more than usual. I think the whole &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; aspect to it is what causes this. It pulls out all the toxins and impurities from your body and then it just lingers in your armpits until you shower it off. Even after a shower, it makes you smell like you haven&#x27;t showered in years. It&#x27;s honestly rotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I stopped using this deodorant, all of the issues I was having disappeared completely. Please, do yourself a favor and never buy this awful product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well BUT I am not moving around much due to surgery~</li>
            <li> ...enjoy smelling like you&#x27;re caramelizing onions in your armpits two hours after showering, this is the deodorant for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this deodorant smells great until you actually use it.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, but I still sweated like a nasty pig ass douche.</li>
            <li> Before I review this I want to state that I usually use antiperspirant... I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant because of the aluminum in the antiperspirant.  I am not a sweaty person and I do not have strong body odor so I thought it would be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the deodorant the fragrance was nice but barely there which....whatever.... My 2nd day using I did noticed a slight body odor. I freaked out...When I reapplied it did seem to neutralize it... But by the end of the day...again... I didn&#x27;t pass my own smell test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have winter weather right now so I&#x27;ll try it a little longer..  I will not be able to trust this in the summer heat. I know it will not decrease perspiration... Like I said I don&#x27;t sweat much but I don&#x27;t feel like it does a trustworthy job..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: okay i gave it weeks. im done with it. i bought toms to try. geo deo goes on wet and stays wet. mid day i smell b.o. i gave it weeks. im not sure if the b.o. is strong enough for other people to smell but im not taking that chance. i definately smell it on my fingers when i do the \\&quot;dip and sniff\\&quot;. (gross i know... but i think everyone does it lol) so im giving up the geo deo. like i said i dont sweat much, i shower daily, and i never thought of myself as a stinky person. im done with this stuff. for me its good for nothing.</li>
            <li> No chemicals and smells nice. Now that I quit using antiperspirant I think I actually sweat less.</li>
            <li> the deodorant itself smells good but does not keep away the BO!</li>
            <li> I tried all three--unscented, Island, and Ocean.  All of them worked the same for me, so this is a review of all of them (with a remark about each scent at the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; type deodorants.  I don&#x27;t need or want the antiperspirant (aluminum) component of deodorants.  I just want something which will stop odor. Deodorants stop odor and antiperspirants stop wetness.  Unfortunately, antiperspirants require alum or aluminum, neither of which I want on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almost all the popular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands and am disappointed by the end of the day.  They just don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m not a heavy laborer or anything like it, but some of them seem to make me smell awful.  I bought this brand, not expecting it to work, but it was on sale at our local co-op.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used it for ten days (I apply it every morning) and it&#x27;s been great.  I don&#x27;t perspire much, so that isn&#x27;t an issue. As I said, I am trying to avoid alum (like the mineral stick put out for the Geodeo people) and aluminum products.  This doesn&#x27;t have it in it, so you may perspire with it.  I&#x27;ll take my chances with perspiration instead of aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried three versions: unscented, Island, and Ocean.  I smelled the scented ones and thought they might be too strong, but after using them I discovered they aren&#x27;t.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;d still avoid them.  All three are good at preventing odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other deodorants (Mennon Speed Stick, for example), these don&#x27;t leave an icky residue on your skin, even after showering.  I&#x27;m sold on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company to compliment them on their product and they were very nice.  I didn&#x27;t get a coupon or anything, but they still were nice.  ;)  I&#x27;m going to put this comment on all three versions, so if you see it I&#x27;m not trying to put anything over on anyone.  I&#x27;ve used all three and want to comment on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat negative: the top is hard to get off, andthere is a cap-thing which is stuck inside the top of the cap.  The rep told me that is supposed to be there to keep it from drying out, but I didn&#x27;t know that and tried to remove it.  Also, the first time you use it, it&#x27;s hard to turn the stick.  It gets better immediately, but that first turn is hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Island scent really smelled too sweet at first.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it, but I got it just because I wanted to try it.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long and is not overpowering. It&#x27;s my least favorite, but it does work and I don&#x27;t smell sickeningly sweet all day.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant around.  Most of the natural deodorant brands make you stink around noon. Geodeo is the best I have found.  Please note, natural deodorants work differently from person to person based on their makeup.  I have had friends that have used Geodeo and not liked it as much as me.  Its trail and error, but it worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I found this deodorant on clearance at my local natural food/product store, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I absolutely love the smell, and I like how the deodorant goes on and isn&#x27;t messy.  Also, like the unique colored packaging.  However, that is where the positive ends.  You are lucky if this stuff lasts you 4 hours.  I work in an office setting where it is normally not hot, but I was sweating just a tad today because of the type of shirt I was wearing.  I could smell myself a little around lunch, and I smelled nasty by the end of the day.  I was afraid for others getting too close would smell me.  You couldn&#x27;t even smell the deodorant at all by then.  It was just all BO smell.  If you reapply it, it will get better for a little while, but who wants to go around reapplying deodorant every little bit.  I can&#x27;t even imagine being out on a hot summer day sweating profusely and trying to use this.  Would not recommend this at all unless you just want a container of something nice to open up and smell once in awhile.  It&#x27;s too bad because I liked everything about it except the fact that it doesn&#x27;t serve its purpose to keep odor under control.  I should mention that I have been wearing this deodorant for a few weeks, but it has just recently started getting more hot and humid here so the deodorant is showing its weakness.  I was trying to give it a chance to see if it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant uses crystals which apparently work quite well. But fair warning, 24 hours later I stink, so you just use it every 24 hours or else!</li>
            <li> I give this four stars for a couple of reasons - this has no aluminum, parabens, petrochemicals, sulfates, dyes.  Some of the ingredients are organic, most are naturally derived.  Made in the USA.  I actually like this island scent during the winter months, it is very light, it has a hint of tea scent, but not heavy with that cloying sweetness of coconut that is so often attributed to &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Well, I need to reapply if I use it first thing when I wake up, then again in the evening if I am going out.  But then some days are better and it is fine until the next day.  It truly depends on your body, your activity level, and your daily hygiene routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.  I bought in in autumn, so I have not tested it in the warm weather yet.  But there have been days where I have overdressed or exercised and got hot and perspired a great deal - I did detect a bit of odor by the evening then.  But to me it is okay to reapply ... I&#x27;d rather do that then use the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sticky texture even when dry and the fragrance is similar to the odor of rotting fruit.  I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised people hate the smell. It&#x27;s my favorite part...very fruity and fresh. For me this causes no irritation which is great but doesn&#x27;t last all day. Like most natural deoderant I have tried you have to reapply. But if you do start to smell this stuff takes it away after reapplying. I use it a few times a week switching off with homemade coconut deodorant that does last all day but is sometimes irritating. This stuff is gentle and it helps keep irritation down by using it off and on. So I still like it. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so that&#x27;s probably why it may not work on everyone. And seriously...I really do live the scent. :)</li>
            <li> Great shippingnand service</li>
            <li> I only use deodorants with natural ingredients, and was looking forward to trying this one.  Even though there were a number of poor reviews, it did work for some people, and I was hopeful.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent, since I thought it would be more of a tropical pina colada scent -- it was more like a somewhat odd grapefruit type smell.  But, the worst thing is that not long after using, I needed a shower and some other dedorant.  I don&#x27;t know how this product made me smell worse than I ever have before.  Not sure about the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; aspect-- or if it might work better with longer use.  Although, there&#x27;s no way I could have used longer unless I was living on a deserted island.  This one is going in the garbage, what a waste.  I went back to using Lafes roll-on, which is still the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked for me. I couldn&#x27;t find it at my last trip to Whole Foods so I&#x27;m trying a different brand. I think a lot of the negative reviews are because people expect the same results from a natural deodorant as a chemical-laden antiperspirant. This deodorant is exactly that, it deodorizes. It does not stop you from sweating, nor does any other natural deodorant. It takes at least a week, sometimes 3-4, for your body to completely adjust to a natural deodorant. Try it and reapply when you start to smell- for me, that was 2-3 times a day (morning, night and sometimes once at work). This was the first natural deodorant I tried and I definitely had a &#x27;detox&#x27; period where it did not work very well. I actually found my arm pits sweating less than with antiperspirant. The only time I had strong BO that this deodorant did not help with was when I was skiing or day 2+ of camping-- I ski hard and tour as well so I tend to get pretty sweaty. And, well, its hard to keep smelling pretty after camping. Otherwise.. I could forget to put some on in the morning and not smell strongly by the end of the day (after using the deodorant for several months).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different deodorant products that are natural and this one certainly doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t keep you smell free for long. Unfortunately the seller would not refund me either....very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel? I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work. Still, I bought this product on a whim, because I wanted to see if the &amp;#34;odor neutralizing enzymes&amp;#34; in it truly worked. I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O. It didn&#x27;t work at all! In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell! I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant before too, same problem, not only did it not prevent the B.O., it added to it! The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands. They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt. I can&#x27;t imagine how Geodeo is supposed to be a deodorant for running around during the day when it can&#x27;t even inhibit bacteria growth at night, when you&#x27;re not even sweating. If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not a huge fan of having to wind it up and down every time I want to use it (otherwise the lid doesn&#x27;t close if you leave the stick of deodorant up) and the smell is just ok. But I wanted an aluminum free deodorant and this one suffices.</li>
            <li> It did not work during 50 degree weather so I can imagine during the summer. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me whatsoever...might as well have not used it because I smelled like someone who does not care about personal hygiene</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it zero stars. Smells great when you open it but smell disappears right when you put it on. I started stinking within 2 hrs of wearing this deodorant. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> great scent, and long lasting too.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product deserves it. I LOVE IT. i read a few of the results and i wanted to point something out. This product indicates that will detox. During the detox phase, i did notice that i was able to smell a slight odor. But after about 3 weeks, i was able to go the whole day without any odor. I also do not sweat that much. This is the first natural deodorant that I have tried and I love it. The real test will be a summer in Florida and My Christmas Vacation to Trinidad. I will provide updates.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful! BUT does NOT keep you from stinking if you break even the slightest sweat. I bought this and applied before a 30-min workout and 2 minutes in....just the warm up...I was SMELLY! Like gag-me smelly!</li>
            <li> The strange thing about this deodorant is that it didn&#x27;t work for the first week...  I kept it up though, and it just started working after a week of use.. Also I put on a good amount, and let it dry before I put my shirt on.  I love this deodorant!</li>
