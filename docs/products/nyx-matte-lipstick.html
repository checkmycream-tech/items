            <li>I think this buyer is very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have reddish blond hair, and this lipstick did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Great Price and Great Product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lipstick though!</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>If you are fair skinned, stay away from this color!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color</li>
            <li>so although the color of this is beautiful it was quite a struggle even putting it on...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a beautiful color and looks great.</li>
            <li>im happy with,</li>
            <li>It lasts forever, it&#x27;s the perfect thickness and not to mention the fact that the color is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This lipstick looks great  on my wife</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Lol Happy</li>
            <li>lol when it arrive it looked kinda melted ;( that could of been a reason</li>
            <li>NYX is great but matte is not for me.</li>
            <li>Loved the product, loved the service !</li>
            <li>I like the color, and you can combine it with a lip gloss for a very nice color</li>
            <li>I love NYX products they are great and affordable!</li>
            <li>really nicely and doesn&#x27;t have a smell!</li>
            <li>Great textures and good coverage</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick, the nude color is perfect!</li>
            <li>Love this nude one of the best nudes I have.</li>
            <li>I really loved this because it was a good price and the color looked great.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and nice consistency.</li>
            <li>The lipstick came smooched and the color was a bright coral.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair to medium.</li>
            <li>If you find that you don&#x27;t look good in coral or orangey colored lipstick, this probably will not look good either.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it</li>
            <li>ive been looking for a good nude color lipstick and when i saw this one i figured</li>
            <li>Nyx is a good make-up brand.</li>
            <li>Not it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>but otherwise the matte lipstick wasnt good</li>
            <li>w purchase &amp;  price is good.</li>
            <li>i saw lots of good comments thats</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect light tone I needed.</li>
            <li>this was a good item for the price</li>
            <li>My skin is fair/medium, but I dont think that it would be good for any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I needed a good nude color to wear when I do smokey eyes.  </li>
            <li>This color does not look good with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The pictures are face, i have medium skin and there is no way it looks that good on me.</li>
            <li>loved what I read.  </li>
            <li>The color looked nothing like what was displayed, good service</li>
            <li>your lips have to be in pristine condition for any matte lipstick to look good.</li>
            <li>so I was excited as this lipstick is the perfect color.  </li>
            <li>While I find that it washes me out on its own, using a cream or light brown color lipgloss would give me the perfect nude lip.</li>
            <li>It looks great if I apply my Burts Bees chapstick, then the lipstick, and then more chapstick.</li>
            <li>for it sits on top of lips !</li>
            <li>I love nude shades and lipsticks!</li>
            <li>Will order more of  course!</li>
            <li>Actually I love all the products from NYX!</li>
            <li>Nice color, I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lipstick, but I didn&#x27;t expect the color to be pinkish.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with it this lipstick.</li>
            <li>and this looked nice on the models but looks kinda orange on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blend in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Really nice texture</li>
            <li>Need to work with the product using fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice colour and pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It honestly makes me look like I&#x27;ve passed away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good matte lipstick for awhile, and I LOVE NYX Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>but the color is nice...</li>
            <li>For me, I liked the look</li>
            <li>I kind of felt</li>
            <li>The colors are nice tho.&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
            <li>The color itself is kind of orangey-pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy to have discoverd NYX cosmetics on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty color, its a really bright color, Ive gotta add!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light caramel on complexion and on me this is a BRIGHT, neon coral color.</li>
            <li>But it was a beautiful nude pink that sat beautifully on my lips.</li>
            <li>its so smooth u can opt to put gloss over if ur in the mood fast shipping n product in perfect condition</li>
            <li>Love love love this lipstick, love the color!</li>
            <li>It does not go well with darker skin tones but might be more suitable for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>perfect color and absolutely matte - exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Just ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>Will really give you a sexy, gorgeous and sultry kind of matte.</li>
            <li>It wont stay on for more than 5 minutes and just looked like cake on my lips.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll still use it! :)</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lipstick EVER.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the formula for this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lipstick because Lorac Cosmetics stopped making my favorite lipstick color-</li>
            <li>Love my lipstick.</li>
            <li>Make sure lips are not chapped...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way more coral/orange than it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li>Love the colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love the lipstick</li>
            <li>Before you purchase, make sure that it will blend in with your complexion.</li>
            <li>Besides that, its okay.</li>
            <li>love this color and this brand.</li>
            <li>The lipstick had smeared around the inside of the top.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color</li>
            <li>but because I absolutely love the color, I will probably buy it again</li>
            <li>I love this nyx one.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>im more of a tan person.</li>
            <li>It is more orange than I would expect from a nude.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the shade of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; was more of a peach color</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Three hours top</li>
            <li>This is a nice color and YES its nude but its more of a light pink/ nude.</li>
            <li>I love this nude color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more creammy than I wanted</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this color &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It comes out more orange on my lips, though it blends&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>I have a deeper caramel complexion so it brings the color out more.</li>
            <li>The lipstick was detached from the tube and the top of it was smushed inside the cover.  </li>
            <li>I love the NYX matte lipstick line.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be more of a pinkish nude.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s more orange and does not compliment my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li>I wish they took better care of the product.</li>
            <li>Maybe better for lighter skin tones</li>
            <li>I ordered this lipstick in nude, thinking it would be more tan/flesh color.</li>
            <li>Love the color does not smear</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because it lasted longer than most I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The color was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think the price was great, the item arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I still love the color a lot though...</li>
            <li>:) i will order more</li>
            <li>I recieved this lipstick in the mail a couple days ago thinking I had the perfect color I&#x27;ve been looking for in my head, but this color doesn&#x27;t look like this, not far off</li>
            <li>It looked very Pinkish &amp; bright looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a light corally looking color.</li>
            <li>When wearing a matte finish make sure your lips are hydrated and smooth because you can see every imperfection.</li>
            <li>I love the peachy nude color and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the description had explained that the neutral color was not like a chapstick, but more like a light colored lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of their True Red Matte Lipstick, and found the color and the coverage to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It is a nice color and good price, only problem....</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice;)</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty nice, but if you eat with it on it starts to look ugggggggggggggggggggggg.</li>
            <li>LOVED IT otherwise, lasts for a 4 hours or normal wear since I tend to drink lots of liquids.</li>
            <li>I received this lipstick and two others that came perfectly fine, but this one was broke and smeared in the bottle.</li>
            <li>i thought i would try a new color it turns out that i love the color i love the way if feels on and most important it has no taste.</li>
            <li>This color ended up being a very bright barbie pink</li>
            <li>A bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; in application, needs to be used with a gloss simply to smooth out application.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.</li>
            <li>im light skinnked and</li>
            <li>And the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap lipstick</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a light orange</li>
            <li>you have to wear lip gloss over it, you can wear the lipstick by itself because it just doesn&#x27;t go on smooth</li>
            <li>Thinking it would be a neutral / light flesh tone color</li>
            <li>and I was secure</li>
            <li>looked cheap</li>
            <li>I received my package in the mail today and the lipstick color is fantastic....</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I found that the color was too light for me</li>
            <li>It applies smooth, but gets the &amp;#34;ripple&amp;#34; appearance to it after wearing for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>I know its a matte lipstick but its cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for ruining that for me!!!</li>
            <li>Great lipstick looks very pretty with my light skin tone and blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out, but it is not moisturizing at all and looks rediculously flaky.  </li>
            <li>I love so far all the NYX products they are very affordable and good pigment and formula.</li>
            <li>So when I came across this nude, I got really excited.</li>
            <li>Had to clean off and fix that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a peachy bright pink color.</li>
            <li>this lipstick will show every single line in your lips (that doesn&#x27;t look too great).</li>
            <li>But in reality, hippie chic is actually a very bright neon hot pink color.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not the color I wanted, I still really like it. :)</li>
            <li>If you want true matte, go for NYX, Always.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat ok if I slap on a ton of chapstick beforehand, but too much work for me.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and pale skin.  </li>
            <li>Not the true nude I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I can not say not a bad point about this product.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a nude on me, it&#x27;s more of a new on really light people</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy about the product and will likely reorder.</li>
            <li>I gave this two stars because I don&#x27;t have a problem with the formula I love NYX Matte Lipstick because the color is so vibrant and long-wearing.</li>
            <li>I was super stoked when it got here today</li>
            <li>Subtle soft and perfect for those summer days :)</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost the exact color!</li>
            <li>This is a very smooth lipstick and I really like it but its very creamy so beware.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice with a little gloss on top</li>
            <li>This is such a nice lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Color wise, did not match even remotely the color and texture in the ad, was not a peachy nude color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s never a disappointment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural yet sexy.</li>
            <li>I just would have liked to have gotten nude vs light baby pink.</li>
            <li>I tried many colors and only one fit as described.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who is looking for a completely nude shade, I would classify this more as a salmon color.</li>
            <li>It was very nice, however, when I applied just a little bit and blended it with my finger.</li>
            <li>but i assume it will wipe right off your lips on its own or onto your teeth very shortly after applying it.</li>
            <li>It was far more sheer than I was expecting, based on how beautifully the red from the Matte line covered.</li>
            <li>The color and matte form just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li>However, when I blended another color over top and used a dark gloss, the color was much better.</li>
            <li>Really good color, i was scared you itd be too dark</li>
            <li>The nude is more of a light pink.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty fair), and looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a subtle nude, but it kind of comes out as a neon pinkish/orangish color.</li>
            <li>I still love it and use it several times a day</li>
            <li>Too much of a tan colour for me!</li>
            <li>Went to use it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Great color, last a long time.</li>
            <li>It was delivered so fast!</li>
            <li>First of all, this isn&#x27;t even a nude color.</li>
            <li>I love would still recommend it to the next person.</li>
            <li>but im amazed at the formula and definitely will be getting more shades.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>maybe a different color would work better</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re still looking for someone who this color looks flattering on, though most take one look at the color in the tube and have to be \\&quot;double dog dared\\&quot; to try it on.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This stays on pretty well, and does not melt in the container.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it for a &amp;#34;nude lip&amp;#34; look, but it is a nice pink that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be worn by Courtney Stodden (bless her heart).</li>
            <li>it was chalky and the whole lipstick fell right out of the tube when I opened it.</li>
            <li>comes on very smooth and stays on for a long time, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>It was kind of pink but very light matte pink</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve worn NXY matte lipstick and loved them.</li>
            <li>Save you money, look for a nude matte that is true to the color they advertise because NYX lied in those pics, color is nowhere near how it looks there.</li>
            <li>I know certain colors and pigmentations sometimes have an effect on the quality of the lipstick and</li>
            <li>I love the color, shade, everything about this  makeup,except when you twist it to put it on, its loose....</li>
            <li>A little color, a little shimmer and a perfect pout for daytime.  </li>
            <li>And because I am an older woman, I suppose nude should be avoided in all ways!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty high standards, even for amazon..</li>
            <li>Absolutely did not like it at all and will not purchase from the brand at all.</li>
            <li>much preferred  </li>
            <li>The color nude really is.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had paint on my lips the whole 3 minutes</li>
            <li>was that the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>I save SOOO much money.</li>
            <li>and I expected more of a nude.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very grainy.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t like this lipgloss cause</li>
            <li>This lipstick is more pink than nude.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping, with coupons.</li>
            <li>Very chalky.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very creamy in my opinion and not a matte.</li>
            <li>that I really like.</li>
            <li>but I really like the color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way more pink than nude.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Exelent, very god, I like</li>
            <li>much too drying for me.</li>
            <li>Affordable make up and extremely high quality!</li>
            <li>Much more frosty pink than nude.</li>
            <li>So I really thought from the picture it would arrive the color on the description.</li>
            <li>Although, I do love other lipsticks by NYX.</li>
            <li>to dry, not enough moisture the color was a nice shade,</li>
            <li>like I looked like a 13 year old trying on lipstick for the first time.</li>
            <li>Its really smooth and doesnt make my lips dry either.</li>
            <li>If you want that, this truly pink matte lipstick is fine.  </li>
            <li>I add a little gloss and it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>I just put on very little and blend it with clear and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>where near the picture - it is very orange/coral looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light pink.</li>
            <li>This lipstick isn&#x27;t creamy and it likes to gunk together as soon as you put it on, I&#x27;ve tried to blend with Chapstick and it does kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>this has a high pigment and it looks very natural</li>
            <li>They either didn&#x27;t send me the right color, or they aren&#x27;t marketing the color the proper way.</li>
            <li>The color doesnt look right on my complexion and it defiantly doesn&#x27;t look like the pics they have above.</li>
            <li>This product is not bad, it was just much lighter than expected!</li>
            <li>usually Matte lipsticks are very thick and tug when you apply but this is super smooth and glides on amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it, but have to use very lightly and usually blot after with tissue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a pink mixed with a brown/nude.</li>
            <li>Its a matte lipstick so can look pretty chalky if you don&#x27;t prepped prior to applying.</li>
            <li>But I still love it and wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>It might have been a cool color pink, but it was matte</li>
            <li>I use mine with a lip gloss and it still looks amazing,  unless you want it all matte might need to add a small amount so your lips don&#x27;t get dry fast.</li>
            <li>It had a heavy matte consistency which would be fine if the color was pleasing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even too light skin or too dark!</li>
            <li>It wears decently well - does not come off right away but reapplication for a long night is necessary.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and makes my lips look like I have dead skin.</li>
            <li>When u put it on ur lips look like u found 10 years old lipstick</li>
            <li>i have hundreds of lipsticks and this by far is my favourite colour and quality out of them all &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it is VERY cakey.</li>
            <li>Just received this lipstick and its completely unusable.</li>
            <li>cuz im rly pale, but its a really nice pink nude color.</li>
            <li>Not wearable by itself if you have light or pale skin.</li>
            <li>A nice nude color to pair along with a very dark almost black smokey eye look.</li>
            <li>I didnt wear it long enough to test this because i wiped it off with a tissue right away....</li>
            <li>Looks okay wo any tweaking, aka blending w other lipsticks, but my advice is to blend w other lippies!</li>
            <li>I find that the color is a little more pink than it shows in the photo.</li>
            <li>Only down side for me is that it does get a bit dry if you don&#x27;t apply more after a while.</li>
            <li>Warning- VERY flaky and makes my lips look dry.</li>
            <li>And its super messy, some place just like</li>
            <li>This nude was not nude on me but more like a pale pink.  </li>
            <li>Two friends of mine tried it to see if it suited them (the first is a medium fair skinned brunette, the second is olive skinned with black/brown hair) with equally bad results.</li>
            <li>careful folks, this is very pigmented so this can come off looking almost coral on the lips.</li>
            <li>This was shipped directly from Amazon and not an individual seller</li>
            <li>Not even the whitest of white people have this color of lips naturally.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again in the near future!</li>
            <li>color was not attractive and did NOT look appealing in any way...</li>
            <li>Okay, when I received this it was broken.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a typical cheap lipstick - doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and doesn&#x27;t really offer any benefits other than it might be the color you want.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how quickly the lipstick comes off, I&#x27;m not sure if this is legit NYX.</li>
            <li>I wear it with a clear base lip gloss/chapstick to make it not so dry, but other than that, I&#x27;m impressed</li>

            <li> I think this buyer is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have reddish blond hair, and this lipstick did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Great Price and Great Product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lipstick though!</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> If you are fair skinned, stay away from this color!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color</li>
            <li> so although the color of this is beautiful it was quite a struggle even putting it on...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a beautiful color and looks great.</li>
            <li> im happy with,</li>
            <li> It lasts forever, it&#x27;s the perfect thickness and not to mention the fact that the color is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This lipstick looks great  on my wife</li>
            <li> lol  </li>
            <li> Lol Happy</li>
            <li> lol when it arrive it looked kinda melted ;( that could of been a reason</li>
            <li> NYX is great but matte is not for me.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, loved the service !</li>
            <li> I like the color, and you can combine it with a lip gloss for a very nice color</li>
            <li> I love NYX products they are great and affordable!</li>
            <li> really nicely and doesn&#x27;t have a smell!</li>
            <li> Great textures and good coverage</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, the nude color is perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this nude one of the best nudes I have.</li>
            <li> I really loved this because it was a good price and the color looked great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and nice consistency.</li>
            <li> The lipstick came smooched and the color was a bright coral.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair to medium.</li>
            <li> If you find that you don&#x27;t look good in coral or orangey colored lipstick, this probably will not look good either.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it</li>
            <li> ive been looking for a good nude color lipstick and when i saw this one i figured</li>
            <li> Nyx is a good make-up brand.</li>
            <li> Not it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> but otherwise the matte lipstick wasnt good</li>
            <li> w purchase &amp;  price is good.</li>
            <li> i saw lots of good comments thats</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect light tone I needed.</li>
            <li> this was a good item for the price</li>
            <li> My skin is fair/medium, but I dont think that it would be good for any skin tone.</li>
            <li> I needed a good nude color to wear when I do smokey eyes.  </li>
            <li> This color does not look good with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The pictures are face, i have medium skin and there is no way it looks that good on me.</li>
            <li> loved what I read.  </li>
            <li> The color looked nothing like what was displayed, good service</li>
            <li> your lips have to be in pristine condition for any matte lipstick to look good.</li>
            <li> so I was excited as this lipstick is the perfect color.  </li>
            <li> While I find that it washes me out on its own, using a cream or light brown color lipgloss would give me the perfect nude lip.</li>
            <li> It looks great if I apply my Burts Bees chapstick, then the lipstick, and then more chapstick.</li>
            <li> for it sits on top of lips !</li>
            <li> I love nude shades and lipsticks!</li>
            <li> Will order more of  course!</li>
            <li> Actually I love all the products from NYX!</li>
            <li> Nice color, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lipstick, but I didn&#x27;t expect the color to be pinkish.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with it this lipstick.</li>
            <li> and this looked nice on the models but looks kinda orange on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend in nicely.  </li>
            <li> Really nice texture</li>
            <li> Need to work with the product using fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice colour and pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It honestly makes me look like I&#x27;ve passed away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good matte lipstick for awhile, and I LOVE NYX Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> but the color is nice...</li>
            <li> For me, I liked the look</li>
            <li> I kind of felt</li>
            <li> The colors are nice tho.&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
            <li> The color itself is kind of orangey-pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy to have discoverd NYX cosmetics on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, its a really bright color, Ive gotta add!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light caramel on complexion and on me this is a BRIGHT, neon coral color.</li>
            <li> But it was a beautiful nude pink that sat beautifully on my lips.</li>
            <li> its so smooth u can opt to put gloss over if ur in the mood fast shipping n product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Love love love this lipstick, love the color!</li>
            <li> It does not go well with darker skin tones but might be more suitable for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> perfect color and absolutely matte - exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Just ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li> Will really give you a sexy, gorgeous and sultry kind of matte.</li>
            <li> It wont stay on for more than 5 minutes and just looked like cake on my lips.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll still use it! :)</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lipstick EVER.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the formula for this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick because Lorac Cosmetics stopped making my favorite lipstick color-</li>
            <li> Love my lipstick.</li>
            <li> Make sure lips are not chapped...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way more coral/orange than it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li> Love the colors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love the lipstick</li>
            <li> Before you purchase, make sure that it will blend in with your complexion.</li>
            <li> Besides that, its okay.</li>
            <li> love this color and this brand.</li>
            <li> The lipstick had smeared around the inside of the top.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color</li>
            <li> but because I absolutely love the color, I will probably buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this nyx one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the color.</li>
            <li> im more of a tan person.</li>
            <li> It is more orange than I would expect from a nude.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the shade of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; was more of a peach color</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Three hours top</li>
            <li> This is a nice color and YES its nude but its more of a light pink/ nude.</li>
            <li> I love this nude color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more creammy than I wanted</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this color &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It comes out more orange on my lips, though it blends&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> I have a deeper caramel complexion so it brings the color out more.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was detached from the tube and the top of it was smushed inside the cover.  </li>
            <li> I love the NYX matte lipstick line.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more of a pinkish nude.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s more orange and does not compliment my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> I wish they took better care of the product.</li>
            <li> Maybe better for lighter skin tones</li>
            <li> I ordered this lipstick in nude, thinking it would be more tan/flesh color.</li>
            <li> Love the color does not smear</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it lasted longer than most I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The color was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think the price was great, the item arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I still love the color a lot though...</li>
            <li> :) i will order more</li>
            <li> I recieved this lipstick in the mail a couple days ago thinking I had the perfect color I&#x27;ve been looking for in my head, but this color doesn&#x27;t look like this, not far off</li>
            <li> It looked very Pinkish &amp; bright looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a light corally looking color.</li>
            <li> When wearing a matte finish make sure your lips are hydrated and smooth because you can see every imperfection.</li>
            <li> I love the peachy nude color and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the description had explained that the neutral color was not like a chapstick, but more like a light colored lipstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of their True Red Matte Lipstick, and found the color and the coverage to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It is a nice color and good price, only problem....</li>
            <li> Otherwise nice;)</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty nice, but if you eat with it on it starts to look ugggggggggggggggggggggg.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT otherwise, lasts for a 4 hours or normal wear since I tend to drink lots of liquids.</li>
            <li> I received this lipstick and two others that came perfectly fine, but this one was broke and smeared in the bottle.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try a new color it turns out that i love the color i love the way if feels on and most important it has no taste.</li>
            <li> This color ended up being a very bright barbie pink</li>
            <li> A bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; in application, needs to be used with a gloss simply to smooth out application.</li>
            <li> it was cheap.</li>
            <li> im light skinnked and</li>
            <li> And the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap lipstick</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely a light orange</li>
            <li> you have to wear lip gloss over it, you can wear the lipstick by itself because it just doesn&#x27;t go on smooth</li>
            <li> Thinking it would be a neutral / light flesh tone color</li>
            <li> and I was secure</li>
            <li> looked cheap</li>
            <li> I received my package in the mail today and the lipstick color is fantastic....</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> I found that the color was too light for me</li>
            <li> It applies smooth, but gets the &amp;#34;ripple&amp;#34; appearance to it after wearing for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I know its a matte lipstick but its cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for ruining that for me!!!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick looks very pretty with my light skin tone and blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out, but it is not moisturizing at all and looks rediculously flaky.  </li>
            <li> I love so far all the NYX products they are very affordable and good pigment and formula.</li>
            <li> So when I came across this nude, I got really excited.</li>
            <li> Had to clean off and fix that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a peachy bright pink color.</li>
            <li> this lipstick will show every single line in your lips (that doesn&#x27;t look too great).</li>
            <li> But in reality, hippie chic is actually a very bright neon hot pink color.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not the color I wanted, I still really like it. :)</li>
            <li> If you want true matte, go for NYX, Always.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat ok if I slap on a ton of chapstick beforehand, but too much work for me.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and pale skin.  </li>
            <li> Not the true nude I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I can not say not a bad point about this product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a nude on me, it&#x27;s more of a new on really light people</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy about the product and will likely reorder.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because I don&#x27;t have a problem with the formula I love NYX Matte Lipstick because the color is so vibrant and long-wearing.</li>
            <li> I was super stoked when it got here today</li>
            <li> Subtle soft and perfect for those summer days :)</li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost the exact color!</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth lipstick and I really like it but its very creamy so beware.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice with a little gloss on top</li>
            <li> This is such a nice lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Color wise, did not match even remotely the color and texture in the ad, was not a peachy nude color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never a disappointment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural yet sexy.</li>
            <li> I just would have liked to have gotten nude vs light baby pink.</li>
            <li> I tried many colors and only one fit as described.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who is looking for a completely nude shade, I would classify this more as a salmon color.</li>
            <li> It was very nice, however, when I applied just a little bit and blended it with my finger.</li>
            <li> but i assume it will wipe right off your lips on its own or onto your teeth very shortly after applying it.</li>
            <li> It was far more sheer than I was expecting, based on how beautifully the red from the Matte line covered.</li>
            <li> The color and matte form just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li> However, when I blended another color over top and used a dark gloss, the color was much better.</li>
            <li> Really good color, i was scared you itd be too dark</li>
            <li> The nude is more of a light pink.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty fair), and looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a subtle nude, but it kind of comes out as a neon pinkish/orangish color.</li>
            <li> I still love it and use it several times a day</li>
            <li> Too much of a tan colour for me!</li>
            <li> Went to use it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Great color, last a long time.</li>
            <li> It was delivered so fast!</li>
            <li> First of all, this isn&#x27;t even a nude color.</li>
            <li> I love would still recommend it to the next person.</li>
            <li> but im amazed at the formula and definitely will be getting more shades.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> maybe a different color would work better</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re still looking for someone who this color looks flattering on, though most take one look at the color in the tube and have to be \\&quot;double dog dared\\&quot; to try it on.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This stays on pretty well, and does not melt in the container.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it for a &amp;#34;nude lip&amp;#34; look, but it is a nice pink that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be worn by Courtney Stodden (bless her heart).</li>
            <li> it was chalky and the whole lipstick fell right out of the tube when I opened it.</li>
            <li> comes on very smooth and stays on for a long time, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was kind of pink but very light matte pink</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve worn NXY matte lipstick and loved them.</li>
            <li> Save you money, look for a nude matte that is true to the color they advertise because NYX lied in those pics, color is nowhere near how it looks there.</li>
            <li> I know certain colors and pigmentations sometimes have an effect on the quality of the lipstick and</li>
            <li> I love the color, shade, everything about this  makeup,except when you twist it to put it on, its loose....</li>
            <li> A little color, a little shimmer and a perfect pout for daytime.  </li>
            <li> And because I am an older woman, I suppose nude should be avoided in all ways!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty high standards, even for amazon..</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not like it at all and will not purchase from the brand at all.</li>
            <li> much preferred  </li>
            <li> The color nude really is.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had paint on my lips the whole 3 minutes</li>
            <li> was that the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> I save SOOO much money.</li>
            <li> and I expected more of a nude.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very grainy.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like this lipgloss cause</li>
            <li> This lipstick is more pink than nude.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping, with coupons.</li>
            <li> Very chalky.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very creamy in my opinion and not a matte.</li>
            <li> that I really like.</li>
            <li> but I really like the color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way more pink than nude.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Exelent, very god, I like</li>
            <li> much too drying for me.</li>
            <li> Affordable make up and extremely high quality!</li>
            <li> Much more frosty pink than nude.</li>
            <li> So I really thought from the picture it would arrive the color on the description.</li>
            <li> Although, I do love other lipsticks by NYX.</li>
            <li> to dry, not enough moisture the color was a nice shade,</li>
            <li> like I looked like a 13 year old trying on lipstick for the first time.</li>
            <li> Its really smooth and doesnt make my lips dry either.</li>
            <li> If you want that, this truly pink matte lipstick is fine.  </li>
            <li> I add a little gloss and it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> I just put on very little and blend it with clear and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> where near the picture - it is very orange/coral looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light pink.</li>
            <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t creamy and it likes to gunk together as soon as you put it on, I&#x27;ve tried to blend with Chapstick and it does kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> this has a high pigment and it looks very natural</li>
            <li> They either didn&#x27;t send me the right color, or they aren&#x27;t marketing the color the proper way.</li>
            <li> The color doesnt look right on my complexion and it defiantly doesn&#x27;t look like the pics they have above.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, it was just much lighter than expected!</li>
            <li> usually Matte lipsticks are very thick and tug when you apply but this is super smooth and glides on amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it, but have to use very lightly and usually blot after with tissue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a pink mixed with a brown/nude.</li>
            <li> Its a matte lipstick so can look pretty chalky if you don&#x27;t prepped prior to applying.</li>
            <li> But I still love it and wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> It might have been a cool color pink, but it was matte</li>
            <li> I use mine with a lip gloss and it still looks amazing,  unless you want it all matte might need to add a small amount so your lips don&#x27;t get dry fast.</li>
            <li> It had a heavy matte consistency which would be fine if the color was pleasing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even too light skin or too dark!</li>
            <li> It wears decently well - does not come off right away but reapplication for a long night is necessary.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and makes my lips look like I have dead skin.</li>
            <li> When u put it on ur lips look like u found 10 years old lipstick</li>
            <li> i have hundreds of lipsticks and this by far is my favourite colour and quality out of them all &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it is VERY cakey.</li>
            <li> Just received this lipstick and its completely unusable.</li>
            <li> cuz im rly pale, but its a really nice pink nude color.</li>
            <li> Not wearable by itself if you have light or pale skin.</li>
            <li> A nice nude color to pair along with a very dark almost black smokey eye look.</li>
            <li> I didnt wear it long enough to test this because i wiped it off with a tissue right away....</li>
            <li> Looks okay wo any tweaking, aka blending w other lipsticks, but my advice is to blend w other lippies!</li>
            <li> I find that the color is a little more pink than it shows in the photo.</li>
            <li> Only down side for me is that it does get a bit dry if you don&#x27;t apply more after a while.</li>
            <li> Warning- VERY flaky and makes my lips look dry.</li>
            <li> And its super messy, some place just like</li>
            <li> This nude was not nude on me but more like a pale pink.  </li>
            <li> Two friends of mine tried it to see if it suited them (the first is a medium fair skinned brunette, the second is olive skinned with black/brown hair) with equally bad results.</li>
            <li> careful folks, this is very pigmented so this can come off looking almost coral on the lips.</li>
            <li> This was shipped directly from Amazon and not an individual seller</li>
            <li> Not even the whitest of white people have this color of lips naturally.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again in the near future!</li>
            <li> color was not attractive and did NOT look appealing in any way...</li>
            <li> Okay, when I received this it was broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a typical cheap lipstick - doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and doesn&#x27;t really offer any benefits other than it might be the color you want.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how quickly the lipstick comes off, I&#x27;m not sure if this is legit NYX.</li>
            <li> I wear it with a clear base lip gloss/chapstick to make it not so dry, but other than that, I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> I took it off right away because it was too thick</li>
            <li> Naturally, I have dark lips</li>
            <li> this is more like a coral, and the worst part its to light for my skin</li>
            <li> the matte makes my lips look extra dry</li>
            <li> and it was crap the only good thing out of it</li>
            <li> And applying it is hard, it feels like a crayon, and very lumpy.</li>
            <li> The color is very different from what i expected.</li>
            <li> I would expected a different color.</li>
            <li> It was a long shot since I was buying it online and never scene the color in person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time customer and to have this type of product delivered to me is just unacceptable.</li>
            <li> it stays on as long as you don&#x27;t eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> The color is NOT a natural nude color that i was looking for.</li>
            <li> This received a low rating due to the color &amp; the inability to put it on at all.</li>
            <li> It is so chalky and feels so dry ...</li>
            <li> , it is way too dry for me.</li>
            <li> maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to apply lipsticks or my lips are too dry for it</li>
            <li> Was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lipstick itself came loose from the lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> and when i apply , it was very dry.</li>
            <li> At least the black label nude, while not a fan of the color, its very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> its not nude but baby pink, looks kinda like putting foundation on your lips or some kinda oitment, doesnt blend and very dry , I wont be using it</li>
            <li> Color was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a pink hew to it, but the picture is deceiving.</li>
            <li> with pink.</li>
            <li> There is a transparent ring in the center of the tube that looked &amp;#34;Wrong&amp;#34; when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> damage.was not very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> , it looks too rough.</li>
            <li> This is not nude, it&#x27;s pink and ended up in the trash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very creamy, and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> The product arrived sooner then I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is a pastel pink.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit darker pink than this image of what is advertised as &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; and the texture is truly matte.  </li>
            <li> The color is a little off but mixed with darker shades or over other lipsticks</li>
            <li> The color did not work with my fair skin and it looked very bad.</li>
            <li> I have slightly pale skin (not extremely white)</li>
            <li> So far I am beyond disappointed with nyx and will not be purchasing any of their products thanks to nothing but problems with numerous purchases .</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After playing around with it for a while and combining it with other lip products, i&#x27;ve found a look</li>
            <li> Not exactly the color I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have other colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sooo many different brands of Matte lipsticks and this on is definitely not the worst</li>
            <li> I bought the shad in \\&quot;nude\\&quot; and it was very, very pink.</li>
            <li> not worth the money I paid for it and ended up throwing it away ...</li>
            <li> ide give it a negative star if it was possible</li>
            <li> I hate the color but the lipstick itself is ok.</li>
            <li> I ordered hippie chic thinking that it was a neutral pale pink color, because from the picture that&#x27;s what it looks like.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a thumbs down for me.  </li>
            <li> and I wear medium beige in makeup with black hair and dark eyes.  </li>
            <li> The color in the center of the tube was separated &amp; very odd looking.</li>
            <li> If you have even slightly cracked lips</li>
            <li> It look really odd.  </li>
            <li> I had used NYX previously</li>
            <li> I added gloss over it and it toned it down a little bit</li>
            <li> which was pretty disappointing</li>
            <li> Just very disappointed, but I still love NYX anyways!</li>
            <li> could not return it cause of where i live and its not that expensive</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little lighter than my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend that you put some gloss on because this lipstick could sometimes looks and feels a little chalky or drying.</li>
            <li> Tried to pry it out to no available.</li>
            <li> Unusable so waste of money buying it.</li>
            <li> Looks messy.</li>
            <li> all d trouble returning it.</li>
            <li> A waste if time and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> my lips and waited until they dried a bit to put the lipstick on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> instead a peachy-sherbet color that looks like you have dried creamsicle on your lips.</li>
            <li> though, I use those everyday</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not smooth after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reaaally flaky and not good for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look to pale.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty, though the product was really bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed since it was the exact color i needed.</li>
            <li> but, i&#x27;m not sure about it still.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not satisfied..</li>
            <li> , also it seems like a color someone with a dark fake tan would use, it like and organe pink color.</li>
            <li> no more ordering lipstick online.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s SO small.</li>
            <li> When i tried it on it ended up being some weird alien orange color that looks totally unnatural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually all about that Matte life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale skinned</li>
            <li> But the color ended up being this crazy pink that looked horrible on me, rather than the warm neutral nude I saw online.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the lipstick itself came extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li> so it looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li> it wasnt a little broken!</li>
            <li> wanted a nude for summer, and tried this after reading reviews but didnt care for it,  went on weird, strange color, looked fake.  </li>
            <li> but overall, not what I wanted at all. :(</li>
            <li> Opened it up to find the lipstick was broken off inside</li>
            <li> The pigmentation was nonexistent and looked worse than ANY .99 cent lipstick I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> This sucked it came broken</li>
            <li> when i receive this lipstick it was all over the tube, like it was broken.....</li>
            <li> The base was unglued from the actual lipstick.</li>
            <li> Its melted and broken and just all around horrid.</li>
            <li> horrible.. do not waste your time</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it does NOT at all resemble the photos shown of the women wearing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a base, a concealer, its just not right.  </li>
            <li> Now the nude goes on like putting just wrong</li>
            <li> Difficult to roll it I don&#x27;t know why?</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Maybe there was something wrong with it</li>
            <li> the product arrived all melted and weird</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also matte, which makes it look weird.  </li>
            <li> coverage lipstick is flawed.</li>
            <li> and the color didn&#x27;t work with my skin tone unfortunately.</li>
            <li> unfortunately that&#x27;s seems to be the case for this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a matte pink; very disappointed</li>
            <li> a very dull ugly one at that.</li>
            <li> I also got the NYX matte shocking pink....</li>
            <li> really unhappy</li>
            <li> This lipstick is horrible is very mess up</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a very creepy color.</li>
            <li> If you pay close attention, the nude has lots of bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Received it in bad shape.</li>
            <li> My sister also tried it and it looked bad on her too.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate it wasn&#x27;t perfumed with any bad smell.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> It is waxy - just an ugly color.</li>
            <li> It is just that ugly.</li>
            <li> But its not an ugly color.</li>
            <li> Immediately upon receiving this item in the mail, I opened it and put some on, went to look in the mirror and was shocked.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed because I was looking for nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the way it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Putting lip balm before doesn&#x27;t help :(</li>
            <li> but it would have been to time consuming to return :(</li>
            <li> I can maybe mix it with another color using it as a base</li>
            <li> I am hated it</li>
            <li> Very bad condition  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> already I&#x27;m very disappointed ..</li>
            <li> the pictures shown even if it didn&#x27;t separate when applied!&amp;#34; It was very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color is nothing like described and goes on horribly.</li>
            <li> It is cakey and had a horrible texture.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s matte but holy crap!</li>
            <li> but for someone with an olive skin tone and looks terrible on me.</li>
            <li> Looks terrible on.</li>
            <li> It would probably look terrible.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Worst lipstick ever.</li>
            <li> However this color is just an awful nude color for women of color.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!!!</li>

            <li> If you pay close attention, the nude has lots of bad reviews.  I didn&#x27;t see that and ordered it.  My skin tone is olive and I wear medium beige in makeup with black hair and dark eyes.  Now the nude goes on like putting just wrong, I can&#x27;t even explain it but I wouldn&#x27;t be seen in public with this color. It&#x27;s like a base, a concealer, its just not right.  do not recommend.  I&#x27;m using mary kays shell lipstick as a nude.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not like it at all and will not purchase from the brand at all.</li>
            <li> Nice color, I like it. I love NYX products they are great and affordable!</li>
            <li> Color was not what I expected. Just ok</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but I didn&#x27;t realize it would be a shade of peach. I still love it and use it several times a day</li>
            <li> NOT NUDE! at all. pink/red maybe. pictures looks nude. not at all nude.</li>
            <li> Too much of a tan colour for me! I thought it would have a pink hew to it, but the picture is deceiving. Threw mine away!</li>
            <li> Went to use it for the first time today. Opened it up to find the lipstick was broken off inside it&#x27;s  cover. Tried to pry it out to no available. Unusable so waste of money buying it. Disappointed since it was the exact color i needed.</li>
            <li> not nude is actually a coral color and makes me look like a jack o lantern</li>
            <li> This is in no way a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; lipstick. I&#x27;m light caramel on complexion and on me this is a BRIGHT, neon coral color. It&#x27;s cute but I was disappointed because I was looking for nude lipstick. Do not buy if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Great color, last a long time.</li>
            <li> wanted a nude for summer, and tried this after reading reviews but didnt care for it,  went on weird, strange color, looked fake.  much preferred  Revlon Just Bitten Kissing Balm Stain.</li>
            <li> The color is nothing like described and goes on horribly.</li>
            <li> The color is very different from what i expected. I was expecting more of a subtle nude, but it kind of comes out as a neon pinkish/orangish color.I have slightly pale skin (not extremely white) so that may be why the color looks different on me. Also, i need to apply A LOT of chapstick before putting on this lipstick. If you have even slightly cracked lips this lipstick will show every single line in your lips (that doesn&#x27;t look too great). After playing around with it for a while and combining it with other lip products, i&#x27;ve found a look im happy with, but i don&#x27;t know if i will purchase this product again the future.</li>
            <li> The product I revieced was not nude at all! It&#x27;s was a matte pink; very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, it was just much lighter than expected! However, when I blended another color over top and used a dark gloss, the color was much better. It wears decently well - does not come off right away but reapplication for a long night is necessary.</li>
            <li> I really loved this because it was a good price and the color looked great. I received this today and the color wasn&#x27;t as nude as i thought it would be. It&#x27;s more of a light corally looking color. I added gloss over it and it toned it down a little bit but, i&#x27;m not sure about it still. It&#x27;s a good lipstick though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lipstick, but I didn&#x27;t expect the color to be pinkish. I would expected a different color. The color nude really is. Although it&#x27;s not the color I wanted, I still really like it. :)</li>
            <li> When I got this home and tried it on, it did not look nude. It looked orange! Did not go well with my complexion I guess. I&#x27;m fair to medium. When wearing a matte finish make sure your lips are hydrated and smooth because you can see every imperfection.</li>
            <li> If you want true matte, go for NYX, Always. Affordable. Stays for hours. Will really give you a sexy, gorgeous and sultry kind of matte.</li>
            <li> i bought the nude.  but its not nude.  its a pinkish-corally color.  i guess i will spend the $18 on the Jeffery Starr nude matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> If you find that you don&#x27;t look good in coral or orangey colored lipstick, this probably will not look good either.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with it this lipstick. I love the peachy nude color and how smoothly it goes on. While I find that it washes me out on its own, using a cream or light brown color lipgloss would give me the perfect nude lip. Overall, I am very happy about the product and will likely reorder.</li>
            <li> Was kind of disappointed. A bit &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; in application, needs to be used with a gloss simply to smooth out application.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, drying, settles into every line on your lips looking cheap.  At least the black label nude, while not a fan of the color, its very moisturizing.  I actually threw it out. I know I&#x27;ll never wear it. Stay away from this!!</li>
            <li> SO disappointed with this product. In the past I&#x27;ve worn NXY matte lipstick and loved them. The specific product I ordered was the NYX matte lipstick in the color nude. The pigmentation was nonexistent and looked worse than ANY .99 cent lipstick I have ever worn. It wont stay on for more than 5 minutes and just looked like cake on my lips. Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it, I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if mine just came faulty.</li>
            <li> ive been looking for a good nude color lipstick and when i saw this one i figured i would try it. it was cheap. and i love it. im light skinnked and when applied with lip gloss it looks flawless.</li>
            <li> It is so chalky and feels so dry ...not worth the money I paid for it and ended up throwing it away ...ide give it a negative star if it was possible</li>
            <li> This is a great nude lipstick! Love it</li>
            <li> This color doesn&#x27;t match with I got it. it&#x27;s darker than picture. Difficult to roll it I don&#x27;t know why?</li>
            <li> Great lipstick looks very pretty with my light skin tone and blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is horrible is very mess up it look like been use already I&#x27;m very disappointed .. Very bad condition  where can I return this product.</li>
            <li> It was delivered so fast! It is a nice color and good price, only problem....I find that the color is a little more pink than it shows in the photo. Not exactly the color I was looking for but I&#x27;ll still use it! :)</li>
            <li> LOVE it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a nude lipstick for a while now. This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> NYX Matte Lipstick, Nude is very good. And the color is fantastic. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lipstick EVER. It lasts forever, it&#x27;s the perfect thickness and not to mention the fact that the color is AMAZING. I want this in every color.</li>
            <li> Texture, not the best.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power - meh.&lt;br /&gt;So why the 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;This is the color I&#x27;ve been searching for all my life. Can be worn alone, layered, blended, worn as blush, eyeshadow (for the daring and artistic).&lt;br /&gt;Nude with pink. Lovely.</li>
            <li> sent me the wrong color. unless nude is orange now ://// really unhappy</li>
            <li> This is a cheap lipstick And I wanted to try a matte.  It is cakey and had a horrible texture.  It is waxy - just an ugly color.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice lipstick.  A little color, a little shimmer and a perfect pout for daytime.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I just got this today from the mail. And i tried it and i absolutely love it. Really good color, i was scared you itd be too dark cuz im rly pale, but its a really nice pink nude color. And there is no lipstick taste to it so thats a plus too. Its really smooth and doesnt make my lips dry either. Overall, I LOVE IT! Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very big on getting lip colors online and this looked nice on the models but looks kinda orange on my skin tone. I just put on very little and blend it with clear and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> First of all, this isn&#x27;t even a nude color. Second of all, it&#x27;s like paint. Yes, it&#x27;s matte but holy crap! I felt like I had paint on my lips the whole 3 minutes I had it on. I took it off right away because it was too thick and it&#x27;s also not nude. It was kind of pink but very light matte pink so it looked ridiculous. Would not purchase again or any lipstick from NYX.</li>
            <li> Nyx is a good make-up brand. The color and matte form just isn&#x27;t right for me. I love would still recommend it to the next person.</li>
            <li> it was chalky and the whole lipstick fell right out of the tube when I opened it. it looked caked on and and dryed my lips out as soon as I applied it! Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and makes my lips look like I have dead skin. It doesn&#x27;t blend in nicely.  Looks messy. Won&#x27;t try this brand again for lipstick.</li>
            <li> I am hated it Not it&#x27;s good don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s not like the picture I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a thumbs down for me.  I was so excited to try it out, but it is not moisturizing at all and looks rediculously flaky.  It is somewhat ok if I slap on a ton of chapstick beforehand, but too much work for me. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This sucked it came broken and it didnt want to open and it was crap the only good thing out of it was that the shipping was really fast it took a day to get here but otherwise the matte lipstick wasnt good</li>
            <li> This lipstick looks great  on my wife shes kinda olive color skinned it looks perfect on her she wears it all the time</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the formula for this. usually Matte lipsticks are very thick and tug when you apply but this is super smooth and glides on amazing. The color is a little off but mixed with darker shades or over other lipsticks but im amazed at the formula and definitely will be getting more shades.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick because Lorac Cosmetics stopped making my favorite lipstick color- Baby Doll. It was a long shot since I was buying it online and never scene the color in person but it&#x27;s almost the exact color! It may even be the same lipstick? I&#x27;m super happy to have discoverd NYX cosmetics on Amazon. I save SOOO much money. Great Price and Great Product! Love my lipstick.</li>
            <li> Product just glides on the lips... creamy enough yet does not fade... Make sure lips are not chapped...for it sits on top of lips !</li>
            <li> I was looking forward this specific lipstick and when I got it and opened it it was smudged all over the container, I think I can still use it with a brush but that wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. :/</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, its a really bright color, Ive gotta add! lol  Looks okay wo any tweaking, aka blending w other lipsticks, but my advice is to blend w other lippies! Lol Happy w purchase &amp;  price is good.</li>
            <li> Really nice texture but it&#x27;s way more coral/orange than it looks in the photo. It&#x27;s really nice with a little gloss on top but it&#x27;s definitely a light orange and I expected more of a nude.</li>
            <li> This received a low rating due to the color &amp; the inability to put it on at all. Maybe there was something wrong with it but either way the color does not match the description. There is a transparent ring in the center of the tube that looked &amp;#34;Wrong&amp;#34; when I opened the package. The color in the center of the tube was separated &amp; very odd looking. I tried to put it on but it separated on my lips &amp; couldn&#x27;t even be smoothed out on my lips. I tried several times but it remained the same &amp; &amp;#34;Didn&#x27;t look at all like the pictures shown even if it didn&#x27;t separate when applied!&amp;#34; It was very disappointing! It looked very Pinkish &amp; bright looking. It wasn&#x27;t anything at all like the photos shown!</li>
            <li> when i receive this lipstick it was all over the tube, like it was broken.....and when i apply , it was very dry. i saw lots of good comments thats y i bought it, dnt kn if it was jus mine damage.was not very please with this purchase. could not return it cause of where i live and its not that expensive so didnt wanna go tru all d trouble returning it.</li>
            <li> Color not as pictured</li>
            <li> Love the colors but I have to put a gloss or balm over it, it is way too dry for me. Even after exfoliating it shows every line and crease . Not for me .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. When u put it on ur lips look like u found 10 years old lipstick, lips look like u didn&#x27;t drink water for weeks.</li>
            <li> so although the color of this is beautiful it was quite a struggle even putting it on... the product arrived all melted and weird which was pretty disappointing</li>
            <li> i have hundreds of lipsticks and this by far is my favourite colour and quality out of them all &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the lipstick but it&#x27;s a little lighter than my skin complexion. Before you purchase, make sure that it will blend in with your complexion. Besides that, its okay.</li>
            <li> love this color and this brand. comes on very smooth and stays on for a long time, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> horrible.. do not waste your time</li>
            <li> Received it in bad shape. The base was unglued from the actual lipstick. The lipstick had smeared around the inside of the top. Not satisfied..</li>
            <li> I received this lipstick open and the stick was broke off inside the lid. however, I don&#x27;t like to complain, so I just used it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it is VERY cakey. you have to wear lip gloss over it, you can wear the lipstick by itself because it just doesn&#x27;t go on smooth, it looks too rough. but because I absolutely love the color, I will probably buy it again</li>
            <li> Just received this lipstick and its completely unusable. Its melted and broken and just all around horrid. I have pretty high standards, even for amazon..or I should say ESPECIALLY with amazon. I&#x27;m a long time customer and to have this type of product delivered to me is just unacceptable. I can provide pictures if necessary.</li>
            <li> Came unwrapped in a foam bag. The lipstick itself came loose from the lipstick holder. Had to clean off and fix that. Paranoia that someone used it because it wasn&#x27;t sealed or packaged, nodda, just a messed up tube of lipstick, I skipped the return hassle and threw it out. Color wise, did not match even remotely the color and texture in the ad, was not a peachy nude color, it was mauve...a very dull ugly one at that. So far I am beyond disappointed with nyx and will not be purchasing any of their products thanks to nothing but problems with numerous purchases .</li>
            <li> This is not nude, it&#x27;s pink and ended up in the trash</li>
            <li> I love the color, shade, everything about this  makeup,except when you twist it to put it on, its loose....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definately will be spending the extra money and buying from the NYX website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish it wasnt a little broken!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Not the color I expected. A waste if time and money. The nude is more of a light pink.</li>
            <li> Doesnt go on even from the tube. Need to work with the product using fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice colour and pigmentation.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a very creepy color. It honestly makes me look like I&#x27;ve passed away. It&#x27;s very grainy. Won&#x27;t use it again, or buy it again.</li>
            <li> perfect color and absolutely matte - exactly what I wanted! I like NYX lipsticks it&#x27;s never a disappointment just want i wanted</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like this lipgloss cause looks like wall painting on your lips</li>
            <li> I love nude shades and lipsticks! I love this nyx one. It&#x27;s so natural yet sexy. I think it&#x27;s so beautiful.  Only down side for me is that it does get a bit dry if you don&#x27;t apply more after a while. I use mine with a lip gloss and it still looks amazing,  unless you want it all matte might need to add a small amount so your lips don&#x27;t get dry fast. Otherwise nice;)</li>
            <li> This lipstick is more pink than nude. It looks great if I apply my Burts Bees chapstick, then the lipstick, and then more chapstick. I&#x27;m very pale skinned so I probably shouldn&#x27;t have gone for nude, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the color. Exactly what I wanted. Naturally, I have dark lips and this is the perfect light tone I needed. I wear it with a clear base lip gloss/chapstick to make it not so dry, but other than that, I&#x27;m impressed 😉</li>
            <li> I love so far all the NYX products they are very affordable and good pigment and formula. Will order more of  course!</li>
            <li> Color is totally different! And its super messy, some place just like someone already use it. I dont want use it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a nude on me, it&#x27;s more of a new on really light people im more of a tan person. But it was a beautiful nude pink that sat beautifully on my lips. Really fast shipping, with coupons. Loved the product, loved the service !</li>
            <li> Very chalky. I have to put layers of gloss to cover how chalky it is</li>
            <li> It is more orange than I would expect from a nude. Or may be I am not orange enough. Hard to tell.</li>
            <li> They either didn&#x27;t send me the right color, or they aren&#x27;t marketing the color the proper way. And applying it is hard, it feels like a crayon, and very lumpy.</li>
            <li> the color is Nude- but for someone with an olive skin tone and looks terrible on me. its has a  patchy consistency  when applied, not at all something that i would ever purchase again. I think i might try their butter gloss but im done with their matte shades</li>
            <li> The color is pretty, though the product was really bad. It sank into my lip and made my lips wrinkly and almost powdery...i dont recommend it to anyone.. maybe a different color would work better</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the shade of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; was more of a peach color</li>
            <li> I love it. I use almost every day. Does not stay on all day. Three hours top it stays on as long as you don&#x27;t eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color and YES its nude but its more of a light pink/ nude. Stays on pretty nice, but if you eat with it on it starts to look ugggggggggggggggggggggg. lol when it arrive it looked kinda melted ;( that could of been a reason</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good matte lipstick for awhile, and I LOVE NYX Cosmetics. I&#x27;m a huge fan of their True Red Matte Lipstick, and found the color and the coverage to be perfect for me. So when I came across this nude, I got really excited. But the color ended up being this crazy pink that looked horrible on me, rather than the warm neutral nude I saw online. Not only that, but the coverage was inconsistent. It was far more sheer than I was expecting, based on how beautifully the red from the Matte line covered. Just very disappointed, but I still love NYX anyways!</li>
            <li> Thinking it would be a neutral / light flesh tone color but it is no where near the picture - it is very orange/coral looking. It had a heavy matte consistency which would be fine if the color was pleasing but I really don&#x27;t like the color. It definitely should not be called NUDE. I can maybe mix it with another color using it as a base but overall, not what I wanted at all. :(</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick I have used the  gloss for years and I was secure this was a good item for the price this has a high pigment and it looks very natural it is Matt and its so smooth u can opt to put gloss over if ur in the mood fast shipping n product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I love this nude color</li>
            <li> Subtle soft and perfect for those summer days :)</li>
            <li> I bought the shad in \\&quot;nude\\&quot; and it was very, very pink. It might have been a cool color pink, but it was matte so I looked like I was wearing my grandmother&#x27;s lipstick. It was very nice, however, when I applied just a little bit and blended it with my finger.</li>
            <li> I tried this on as soon as I got it... it&#x27;s very creamy in my opinion and not a matte. I didnt wear it long enough to test this because i wiped it off with a tissue right away....but i assume it will wipe right off your lips on its own or onto your teeth very shortly after applying it. The color is NOT a natural nude color that i was looking for. I would best describe it as peach. I&#x27;ll never wear it. Looks terrible on. My skin is fair/medium, but I dont think that it would be good for any skin tone. I also got the NYX matte shocking pink....that I really like. It&#x27;s also more creammy than I wanted but I really like the color.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy!! i got the color in nude and it is not nude at all. it&#x27;s way more pink than nude. plus, the lipstick container does not match images i have seen online!!! FAKE. getting my money back asap!</li>
            <li> I needed a good nude color to wear when I do smokey eyes.  This color does not look good with my skin tone.  I have very fair and pale skin.  It&#x27;s also matte, which makes it look weird.  My sister also tried it and it looked bad on her too.  I can&#x27;t imagine how it would look like on darker skin.  It would probably look terrible.</li>
            <li> I recieved this lipstick in the mail a couple days ago thinking I had the perfect color I&#x27;ve been looking for in my head, but this color doesn&#x27;t look like this, not far off but it was different. I put it on and I looked HORRID. The color did not work with my fair skin and it looked very bad. If you are fair skinned, stay away from this color!</li>
            <li> The lipstick came smooched and the color was a bright coral.  It was horrible.  I threw it right in the trash.</li>
            <li> i didnt like it when i put it on it looked cheap, also it seems like a color someone with a dark fake tan would use, it like and organe pink color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....it is an orange color, not nude as I know it.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say about it....I threw it away</li>
            <li> this is more like a coral, and the worst part its to light for my skin so i cant even use it. The pictures are face, i have medium skin and there is no way it looks that good on me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this color &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It comes out more orange on my lips, though it blends&lt;br /&gt;out really nicely and doesn&#x27;t have a smell!</li>
            <li> careful folks, this is very pigmented so this can come off looking almost coral on the lips. I have a deeper caramel complexion so it brings the color out more. Its a matte lipstick so can look pretty chalky if you don&#x27;t prepped prior to applying. Use chapstick or vaseline to moisturize the lips before apply lipstick. Otherwise, a little goes a long way. LOVED IT otherwise, lasts for a 4 hours or normal wear since I tend to drink lots of liquids.</li>
            <li> But I still love it and wear it everyday! I add a little gloss and it looks fabulous! I like the matte lipstick!</li>
            <li> its not nude but baby pink, looks kinda like putting foundation on your lips or some kinda oitment, doesnt blend and very dry , I wont be using it</li>
            <li> I purchased the NYX matte lipstick in the NUDE shade and I must say... I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The color bled on my lips, and looked as though it had been chipped through even after I throughly&lt;br /&gt;moustroized my lips and waited until they dried a bit to put the lipstick on.&lt;br /&gt;The color was not attractive and did NOT look appealing in any way...&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m not even too light skin or too dark! I&#x27;m a lighter beige color!&lt;br /&gt;Will be requesting a return....&lt;br /&gt;guess I&#x27;ll be sticking to MAC and Makeup Forever</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this lipstick....loved what I read.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get it.  I received my package in the mail today and the lipstick color is fantastic....unfortunately the lipstick itself came extremely damaged.  The lipstick was detached from the tube and the top of it was smushed inside the cover.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the way it arrived.  That is why it got 1 star, otherwise I would have given it 5.  This was shipped directly from Amazon and not an individual seller so I&#x27;m not even going to bother sending it back.  Lesson learned.....no more ordering lipstick online.  Thanks Amazon for ruining that for me!!!</li>
            <li> Exelent, very god, I like</li>
            <li> Love love love this lipstick, love the color!</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth lipstick and I really like it but its very creamy so beware.  I think this buyer is very good.</li>
            <li> Worst lipstick ever. It&#x27;s orange not nude. And it&#x27;s SO small. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have reddish blond hair, and this lipstick did nothing for me. It looked almost like concealer, except I have never seen a shade of concealer this orange. Not peach, not nude, not coral, not pinkish- ORANGE. Two friends of mine tried it to see if it suited them (the first is a medium fair skinned brunette, the second is olive skinned with black/brown hair) with equally bad results. We&#x27;re still looking for someone who this color looks flattering on, though most take one look at the color in the tube and have to be \\&quot;double dog dared\\&quot; to try it on. It is just that ugly.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it does NOT at all resemble the photos shown of the women wearing it. It&#x27;s more of a peachy bright pink color. However, it is a beautiful color and looks great. It&#x27;s also not very creamy, and stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> Great textures and good coverage</li>
            <li> I love the NYX matte lipstick line. I have other colors.  This nude was not nude on me but more like a pale pink.  It look really odd.  I am returning this color.</li>
            <li> The company sent this... And an eyeliner- I had used NYX previously so I was excited as this lipstick is the perfect color.  It seemed as if this was like melted sorta/. The packaging on the inside was all smeary and the eyeliner was out of the box. I won&#x27;t be restocking on my NYX from the company that fulfilled the order.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because I don&#x27;t have a problem with the formula I love NYX Matte Lipstick because the color is so vibrant and long-wearing. However this color is just an awful nude color for women of color. It is NOT nude but instead a peachy-sherbet color that looks like you have dried creamsicle on your lips. It does not go well with darker skin tones but might be more suitable for lighter skin tones. I would not recommend this to anyone with melanin in their skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more of a pinkish nude. But it&#x27;s more orange and does not compliment my skin tone at all. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Looooooove it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wound recommend that after you apply the lipstick that you add a gloss over it so it doesn&#x27;t look to pale.</li>
            <li> Okay, when I received this it was broken. I tried to melt it back together however. I was ruined from the get go. I wish they took better care of the product. As for the color its one of my favorites for the ombre color. Maybe I will order from a different site.</li>
            <li> coverage lipstick is flawed. but the color is nice...</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t even close to it looks in the picture. It&#x27;s more of a pink mixed with a brown/nude. Also, it was damaged when it arrived. Needless to say I wasnt that pleased. I do still use it, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me and my lips making them even dryer. However I gave it to a friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived sooner then I expected.  The color is a matte, like it says on the description.  I like the color, and you can combine it with a lip gloss for a very nice color</li>
            <li> This lipstick is definitely matte, so prep your lips before you wear it or all the cracks and stuff will be highlighted. It lasts all day and it goes on smooth. The only thing is....it&#x27;s not NUDE. It is a pastel pink. Not even the whitest of white people have this color of lips naturally. I&#x27;m tanned so this is definitely not anywhere \\&quot;nude\\&quot; for me. But its not an ugly color. I just would have liked to have gotten nude vs light baby pink.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!!! It looks orange, not nude. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This color ended up being a very bright barbie pink so was not expecting that as the picture is totally different. I hate the color but the lipstick itself is ok.</li>
            <li> the matte makes my lips look extra dry and the color didn&#x27;t work with my skin tone unfortunately. Maybe better for lighter skin tones</li>
            <li> very good quality, and pigmentation and wonderful. I can not say not a bad point about this product. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> to dry, not enough moisture the color was a nice shade, much too drying for me. would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The color doesnt look right on my complexion and it defiantly doesn&#x27;t look like the pics they have above. Save you money, look for a nude matte that is true to the color they advertise because NYX lied in those pics, color is nowhere near how it looks there. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lipstick in nude, thinking it would be more tan/flesh color. When i tried it on it ended up being some weird alien orange color that looks totally unnatural. I love NYX products, but the color of this one is just too weird.</li>
            <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t creamy and it likes to gunk together as soon as you put it on, I&#x27;ve tried to blend with Chapstick and it does kind of sucks. It&#x27;s cheap so you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like their eyelid primers though, I use those everyday</li>
            <li> I received this lipstick and two others that came perfectly fine, but this one was broke and smeared in the bottle. I also don&#x27;t like how quickly the lipstick comes off, I&#x27;m not sure if this is legit NYX.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the description had explained that the neutral color was not like a chapstick, but more like a light colored lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, the nude color is perfect! Actually I love all the products from NYX! Affordable make up and extremely high quality!</li>
            <li> Love the color does not smear</li>
            <li> The color is a bit darker pink than this image of what is advertised as &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; and the texture is truly matte.  If you want that, this truly pink matte lipstick is fine.  For me, I liked the look and I appreciate it wasn&#x27;t perfumed with any bad smell.  I gave it four stars because it lasted longer than most I&#x27;ve tried and I could feel when it was wearing off!  And because I am an older woman, I suppose nude should be avoided in all ways!  :)</li>
            <li> Much more frosty pink than nude. I use it, but have to use very lightly and usually blot after with tissue so I dont look like a malibu barbie doll.</li>
            <li> Love this nude one of the best nudes I have. I wear this with everything.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and nice consistency. Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Do not let rhe picture fool you this color is not nude. It&#x27;s a light pink. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I really thought from the picture it would arrive the color on the description. No such thing, however I got three tubes instead of one. I have given one as a gift, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a typical cheap lipstick - doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and doesn&#x27;t really offer any benefits other than it might be the color you want. I found that the color was too light for me (I&#x27;m pretty fair), and looked kind of weird. I think I wore it once or twice, and now it&#x27;s in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> The color was fantastic! I think the price was great, the item arrived fast. Will purchase again in the near future!</li>
            <li> i like the texture but the colors is completely different than the photo or also than the name. I tried many colors and only one fit as described.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nude lipstick shade since Revlon stopped making my color. This color was suggested by a beauty blog, so I thought I would try it. Immediately upon receiving this item in the mail, I opened it and put some on, went to look in the mirror and was shocked. I kind of felt like I looked like a 13 year old trying on lipstick for the first time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who is looking for a completely nude shade, I would classify this more as a salmon color. It applies smooth, but gets the &amp;#34;ripple&amp;#34; appearance to it after wearing for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to apply lipsticks or my lips are too dry for it, it&#x27;s not smooth after applying. The colors are nice tho.&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
            <li> This stays on pretty well, and does not melt in the container.  However, it is on the pink side and not anywhere near a nude skin tone of a light-skinned woman.  I can&#x27;t use it for a &amp;#34;nude lip&amp;#34; look, but it is a nice pink that doesn&#x27;t look like it would be worn by Courtney Stodden (bless her heart).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reaaally flaky and not good for my dry lips. I still love the color a lot though...Putting lip balm before doesn&#x27;t help :(</li>
            <li> The color looked nothing like what was displayed, good service but it would have been to time consuming to return :(</li>
            <li> NYX is great but matte is not for me. your lips have to be in pristine condition for any matte lipstick to look good. I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> I came all smuched but the color is pretry</li>
            <li> Warning- VERY flaky and makes my lips look dry. I know its a matte lipstick but its cheap looking. You get what you pay for. The color itself is kind of orangey-pink. Not the true nude I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually all about that Matte life but this lipstick goes on kinda chalky. I know certain colors and pigmentations sometimes have an effect on the quality of the lipstick and unfortunately that&#x27;s seems to be the case for this lipstick. I was super stoked when it got here today and I applied it and it was mega drying and it felt chalky. I&#x27;ve used sooo many different brands of Matte lipsticks and this on is definitely not the worst but I am not a fan. Although, I do love other lipsticks by NYX.</li>
            <li> A nice nude color to pair along with a very dark almost black smokey eye look. Not wearable by itself if you have light or pale skin. I&#x27;d also recommend that you put some gloss on because this lipstick could sometimes looks and feels a little chalky or drying.</li>
            <li> I ordered hippie chic thinking that it was a neutral pale pink color, because from the picture that&#x27;s what it looks like. But in reality, hippie chic is actually a very bright neon hot pink color. It was not what I was looking for, but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering make-up off of the internet.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try a new color it turns out that i love the color i love the way if feels on and most important it has no taste. :) i will order more</li>
            <li> Too peachy and looks like chalk when applied . Did not like it at all . Sorry</li>
