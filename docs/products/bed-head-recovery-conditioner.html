            <li>At regular suggested retail price, I wouldn&#x27;t be very impressed.</li>

            <li>Smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different conditioners, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft, and I have a halo of beautiful fragrance around me all the time.  </li>
            <li>Just what I expected in the perfect time, package was neat!!</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my fine hair that is often dry from living in a desert climate.</li>
            <li>It smells good, makes your hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but won&#x27;t make it to my list of staple products or &#x27;must</li>
            <li>Sometimes the very intensive \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; ones make my hair feel even more</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t want to stop using it coz its good on my hair so whenever that happens I just uses Selsun blue to get rid of that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and smells great.  </li>
            <li>it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse hair from coloring it, and this softens it up nicely.  </li>
            <li>i used this conditioner for the first time and my damage hair look already more soft and shiny !</li>
            <li>This is conditioner has a thinner consistency and is suitable for co-washing, not deep conditioning curly or bleached hair.</li>
            <li>the only shampoo and conditioner that I use love it</li>
            <li>Everyones different, so it might be ok on others scalp..</li>
            <li>I have used a different shampoo for many years, and then my daughter-in-law recommended I try this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I paid $15 for this large bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews and concur that this Level 2 (Recovery) is actually better at conditioning than the Level 3 product, which is a bit counter-intuitive.  </li>
            <li>opinion is that it smells funny, not bad just strange</li>
            <li>thanks I also bought the shampoo to complete the whole therapy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and tamed after trying this conditioner!</li>
            <li>leaves hair feeling soft</li>

            <li>My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  </li>

            <li> my hair use to be so dry specially by the tips, and so far this is the only one that helped.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been processed a few times and this product really penetrates giving you the extra moisture dry damaged hair needs.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but everything I use pretty much gets compared to Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie and the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it regularly to speak for any benefits with long term use, but it&#x27;s not a product that I washed out and saw instant improvement</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the last couple of times I used it and let my hair air dry, it was still a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> now have bleached ends dyed purple, and very long and curly, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li> This helped it improve where it no longer looks or feels dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, it&#x27;s the humidity, or if maybe it stops working after you use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I guess it is the product for my hair but not much for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly highlighted hair and this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair had become very dry due to coloring and medications.</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I still have breakage but less breakage.</li>
            <li> and it got dried out, this conditioner has done wonders.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy, slightly oily hair.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s $20 for 1 bottle whereas I usually get the pack of 2bottles at hair cuttery for $23 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this helped with the damage areas</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely will buy again or at least try another Bed Head product.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair and are looking for serious moisture, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> is broken when I received the bottle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately thou, sometimes it gives me dandruff!</li>

            <li> purchased for my teen daughters. they seem to like it so far(meaning they havent asked for anything else)&lt;br /&gt;my opinion is that it smells funny, not bad just strange</li>

            <li> it worth the money. go for it. thanks I also bought the shampoo to complete the whole therapy. they both great</li>
            <li> leaves hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> the only shampoo and conditioner that I use love it</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner i use.  I buy it reg on amazon I cant find in stores</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my fine hair that is often dry from living in a desert climate.</li>
            <li> This is conditioner has a thinner consistency and is suitable for co-washing, not deep conditioning curly or bleached hair. And, it&#x27;s okay. If you have damaged hair and are looking for serious moisture, look elsewhere. Sorry, but everything I use pretty much gets compared to Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie and the price. I paid $15 for this large bottle so I&#x27;m not disappointed. At regular suggested retail price, I wouldn&#x27;t be very impressed. I haven&#x27;t used it regularly to speak for any benefits with long term use, but it&#x27;s not a product that I washed out and saw instant improvement with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have bleached ends dyed purple, and very long and curly, frizz-prone hair. For shampoo I alternate between sulfate-free and Head and Shoulders, clarifying about once every 4 to 6 weeks with vinegar and water. So, I have not tried the accompanying Bed Head shampoo to say how it would work as a \\&quot;system\\&quot;. It&#x27;s good enough to buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but won&#x27;t make it to my list of staple products or &#x27;must-haves\\&quot;. $26.96 being the suggested retail price, you still get a lot for your money. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but not something I just have to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 stars are the value for the sale price.</li>
            <li> Good deal wife loves it</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best feeling conditioners I&#x27;ve tried... and I go through a LOT. Sometimes the very intensive \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; ones make my hair feel even more dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells like a tropical beach somehow and when it makes my hair feel more manageable.

            <li> i used this conditioner for the first time and my damage hair look already more soft and shiny !</li>
            <li> Love this series of Shampoo/Conditioners. It worked great on curly hair and detangling</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my hair feel and I liked the smell.  The price was great and it was nice to get a large size.</li>
            <li> My hair had become very dry due to coloring and medications. This helped it improve where it no longer looks or feels dry.</li>
            <li> is broken when I received the bottle</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Smells great and works great with my hair. Smooth and silky! my hair use to be so dry specially by the tips, and so far this is the only one that helped. Unfortunately thou, sometimes it gives me dandruff! But I don&#x27;t want to stop using it coz its good on my hair so whenever that happens I just uses Selsun blue to get rid of that. So I guess it is the product for my hair but not much for my scalp. But maybe that&#x27;s just me. Everyones different, so it might be ok on others scalp..&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I misunderstood the title of this product. I was just surprised when I opened the box coz I  thought it was for 2 bottles. So it&#x27;s $20 for 1 bottle whereas I usually get the pack of 2bottles at hair cuttery for $23 dollars.</li>
            <li> Amazing transformation to our hair. I love this product. Good shipping timr</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  We&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of different &#x27;salon&#x27; products, and this is the only one that truly conditions her hair and allows her to get a comb through it after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews and concur that this Level 2 (Recovery) is actually better at conditioning than the Level 3 product, which is a bit counter-intuitive.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything and still can&#x27;t find a good conditioner this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have thick curly highlighted hair and this stuff makes it so soft. My hair dresser even commented on how healthy my hair was! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Nice fruity smell. I also reviewed the shampoo. I&#x27;m not really sure this helped with the damage areas I still have breakage but less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair from coloring it, and this softens it up nicely.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different conditioners, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> Bed head shampoo and conditioner makes my over processed hair feel like hair again. Awesome stuff</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. It smells good, makes your hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT !! Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> this is the only conditioner that will settle my unruly hair!!</li>
            <li> This works great for me! It smells really good too! I have really dry hair and this helps moisturize and soften my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a different shampoo for many years, and then my daughter-in-law recommended I try this shampoo.  I am a convert!  I love it!  My hair feels so soft, and I have a halo of beautiful fragrance around me all the time.  I am so glad to have had the recommendation!</li>
