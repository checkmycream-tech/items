            <li>Love love love !!!</li>
            <li>And This One Is Better Than Those!</li>
            <li>is pretty close to the color of the wig too, but people with lighter or darker tones than me would look great in it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect color, the hair is soft and full, the curls look wonderful and aren&#x27;t tangled.</li>
            <li>The color is slightly more bright than the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a amazing wig.</li>
            <li>Amazing fullness for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Its kind of darker than the picture itself</li>
            <li>It was absolutely gorgeous as it was, and I couldn&#x27;t bear to chop off all those glossy, full curls.</li>
            <li>Because it is synthetic it does tangle easy, but it also brushes out nice.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on Halloween when I wore this.</li>
            <li>Way better than I thought it was going to be.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have a wig brush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it is almost identical to the color</li>
            <li>but I love it that way.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this wig and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great quality &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>lovely curls</li>
            <li>But the girls tried them on and they love them anyhow</li>
            <li>The color is much more saturated than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i am not 100% sure how to fix the curls without ruining it.</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft, it&#x27;s full, and the length was perfect.</li>
            <li>While this is what I was hoping for, and it looked just like the color in the picture (perfect for my cosplay), those expecting a light honey color or bleach blonde should order with caution.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The hair texture is great and very natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>This hair unit is very FULL, it seems like it might be even longer than described</li>
            <li>This is more of a light reddish, brown color.</li>
            <li>other than that, great quality!</li>
            <li>Yet the hair is easily tangled, (</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t see the mesh through the hair and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Though it does tangle just a bit once its out, it is a really easy fix.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily too, though -</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Regardless of all the short layers, the wefting rows never even peaked through, and it held  the style beautifully.</li>
            <li>If you plan on wearing it for a full day, I&#x27;d pretreat the ends with a light misting of the Mane N Tail Detangler, which should let you easily brush it through or finger-comb it throughout the day and keep it primed for an easy brushing when the day is done.t.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you plan on wearing it for a full day, I&#x27;d pretreat the ends with a light misting of the Mane N Tail Detangler, which should let you easily brush it through or finger-comb it throughout the day and keep it primed for an easy brushing when the day is done.</li>
            <li>Because It Was So Cheap</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to hook it any to get it to fit</li>
            <li>I received it two days later and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I noticed that in customer pictures, the blonde wig was more like in the picture, a nice light chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>Long-story-short, I did cut it in the end, and it gave me the most spectacular, full short cut.</li>
            <li>At my first AX, loads of people still recognized me as Taiga from Toradora, so overall, I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li>A bit lighter than the photo, but I am still incredibly satisfied with the product and actually enjoy the blonde I received in person better than the display pic.</li>
            <li>The color seemed true to the picture.</li>
            <li>length is pretty accurate to the description</li>
            <li>It has a built-in wig cap that fit pretty snug and held the wig in place.  </li>
            <li>Also, the wig is incredibly shiny and unrealistic, but if you wash it with a bit of fabric softener and then lightly powder it, it looks better.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for the price c</li>
            <li>Definitely worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>For the price it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I would buy again if I could find the right color for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>(I bought at the right time I think).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;HD Microfinish Powder), which should  take the shine right</li>
            <li>This wig is super soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I found that it fits very well on my XL head even with my full fro smashed underneath.  </li>
            <li>I generally cut and style the wigs myself, so when I purchase a wig, I focus mostly on construction, hair quality, and thickness.</li>
            <li>But When It Arrived It Was So Beautiful And Thick.</li>
            <li>Overall a great wig and definitely recommended</li>
            <li>The color doesnt look like the one in the picture, its more of a soft light-ish blond (MUCH nicer than in the photo</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars is only that the wig got really warm (maybe because I had a thick knot of my own hair underneath it), and it got tangled pretty easily, which I would just finger-comb through.  </li>
            <li>It has a higher quality wig cap sewn into it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely wig overall c:</li>
            <li>There is enough hair to feel safe customizing the cut to suit your face and frame.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a wig from another supplier and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the quality, but being two weeks out from Comic Con, I was left scrambling to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a lot of volume for a Sakura cosplay from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicles, that I could cut into her distinctive short cut and that wouldn&#x27;t show the cap underneath no matter how many layers I cut into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I personally like the color more than the picture color.</li>
            <li>I got this wig for an upcoming convention and I was not disappointed it is a little untamed, but after a little hairspray and trim of the bands its perfect.</li>
            <li>The hair does feel like way better quality than regular costume wigs.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more of a honey blonde.</li>
            <li>but they work really well with how I was planning to style the wig!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had a wig before this, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first wigs I&#x27;ve ever ordered on amazon</li>
            <li>and the color is very beauiful!</li>
            <li>The first two photos I&#x27;ve included were just to show the style of the wig.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I found that the color is the exact same as my natural hair, which is nice as it suits my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>Super heavy, but great quality considering it&#x27;s not human hair!</li>
            <li>Arrived early then expected and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love that the bangs were long so I can style or cut them how ever I need them.</li>
            <li>, the hair itself is soft and workable, very mild tangling for a synthetic, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-sized and adjustable (not overly small like those cheap, formless mesh interior jobs), and looks phenomenal, all around.</li>
            <li>It kinda tangles easily but only when its rubbing against fabric</li>
            <li>Nice wig, shipping took a little longer than I like.</li>
            <li>so finding wigs beig enough to fit all of that is a real challenge</li>
            <li>Not to much shedding.</li>
            <li>but maybe because it was so much hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read the reviews on this one and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>As it is (I got it for $12.99), it&#x27;s an absolute steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I ordered blonde, the wig that arrive was a light, caramel brown.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a natural blonde as shown in the photos but it turned out better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is pretty long on a 10 year old, which is what they wanted and is actually much better quality than anything we have purchased at Disneyland.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig.</li>
            <li>is the closest I could get in a picture to the real color.</li>
            <li>However, it was really windy</li>
            <li>And the hair kind of falls out, Only a tiny bit though</li>
            <li>One of the very few wigs I own that is actually large enough to fit on my head.</li>
            <li>i was expecting a dark blonde, but this is more like a light brown.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this was a very high quality wig!  </li>
            <li>its also super curly, unlike many other similar wigs that I have bought.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because it does get messy pretty easily</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than the picture it is more a golden blonde</li>
            <li>It is full and long.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer and generally resign myself to go through multiple wig purchases for each costume, trying to find just the right one that would work for the character.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty wig, but not blonde as described.  </li>
            <li>It came in really small packaging which i was confused by, but the wig it awesome!</li>
            <li>only problems really were that the curls frizz up pretty easily especially if you&#x27;re moving it around a lot</li>
            <li>The wig cap is well made, with a full lace interior and a soft forehead section, complete with side tabs to help you center the wig on your head.</li>
            <li>(that being said it is also a 14 year old using it)  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, when it came in the mail, it was a completely blonde-yellow color.</li>
            <li>Was originally buying this as a spare for a costume and now it&#x27;s one that I use everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and one who specializes in extensions, so I know hair from synthetic to high dollar human Remy.</li>
            <li>The photo they have provided is pretty close, just a little bit less orange and more strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice honey blonde, similar to the pictures, thick</li>
            <li>So, my conclusion: order blonde, and you may get any color from dark brown to light yellow.</li>
            <li>This wig is a major winner in all of those categories.</li>
            <li>The long bangs in the front are perfect for cutting and styling, but could also be left as long, face-framing layers.</li>
            <li>expensive that weren&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>Even though it was the wrong color, its very soft and the curls in my opinion were even better than in the picture.</li>
            <li>Thick enough that I could put it in low ponytails without any bald spots, and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>it went halfway down my back and held its curls pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried it would be too small, and it needed breaking in, but i still love it.</li>
            <li>Also, the front part hung in my eyes a little too much.  </li>

            <li> I received it two days later and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> and I noticed that in customer pictures, the blonde wig was more like in the picture, a nice light chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> Long-story-short, I did cut it in the end, and it gave me the most spectacular, full short cut.</li>
            <li> At my first AX, loads of people still recognized me as Taiga from Toradora, so overall, I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A bit lighter than the photo, but I am still incredibly satisfied with the product and actually enjoy the blonde I received in person better than the display pic.</li>
            <li> The color seemed true to the picture.</li>
            <li> length is pretty accurate to the description</li>
            <li> It has a built-in wig cap that fit pretty snug and held the wig in place.  </li>
            <li> Also, the wig is incredibly shiny and unrealistic, but if you wash it with a bit of fabric softener and then lightly powder it, it looks better.</li>
            <li> Well worth it for the price c</li>
            <li> Definitely worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> For the price it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I would buy again if I could find the right color for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> (I bought at the right time I think).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;HD Microfinish Powder), which should  take the shine right</li>
            <li> This wig is super soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I found that it fits very well on my XL head even with my full fro smashed underneath.  </li>
            <li> I generally cut and style the wigs myself, so when I purchase a wig, I focus mostly on construction, hair quality, and thickness.</li>
            <li> But When It Arrived It Was So Beautiful And Thick.</li>
            <li> Overall a great wig and definitely recommended</li>
            <li> The color doesnt look like the one in the picture, its more of a soft light-ish blond (MUCH nicer than in the photo</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars is only that the wig got really warm (maybe because I had a thick knot of my own hair underneath it), and it got tangled pretty easily, which I would just finger-comb through.  </li>
            <li> It has a higher quality wig cap sewn into it.  </li>
            <li> Lovely wig overall c:</li>
            <li> There is enough hair to feel safe customizing the cut to suit your face and frame.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a wig from another supplier and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the quality, but being two weeks out from Comic Con, I was left scrambling to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a lot of volume for a Sakura cosplay from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicles, that I could cut into her distinctive short cut and that wouldn&#x27;t show the cap underneath no matter how many layers I cut into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I personally like the color more than the picture color.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for an upcoming convention and I was not disappointed it is a little untamed, but after a little hairspray and trim of the bands its perfect.</li>
            <li> The hair does feel like way better quality than regular costume wigs.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of a honey blonde.</li>
            <li> but they work really well with how I was planning to style the wig!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had a wig before this, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first wigs I&#x27;ve ever ordered on amazon</li>
            <li> and the color is very beauiful!</li>
            <li> The first two photos I&#x27;ve included were just to show the style of the wig.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I found that the color is the exact same as my natural hair, which is nice as it suits my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> Super heavy, but great quality considering it&#x27;s not human hair!</li>
            <li> Arrived early then expected and the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love that the bangs were long so I can style or cut them how ever I need them.</li>
            <li> , the hair itself is soft and workable, very mild tangling for a synthetic, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-sized and adjustable (not overly small like those cheap, formless mesh interior jobs), and looks phenomenal, all around.</li>
            <li> It kinda tangles easily but only when its rubbing against fabric</li>
            <li> Nice wig, shipping took a little longer than I like.</li>
            <li> so finding wigs beig enough to fit all of that is a real challenge</li>
            <li> Not to much shedding.</li>
            <li> but maybe because it was so much hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews on this one and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> As it is (I got it for $12.99), it&#x27;s an absolute steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I ordered blonde, the wig that arrive was a light, caramel brown.</li>
            <li> The color is more of a natural blonde as shown in the photos but it turned out better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is pretty long on a 10 year old, which is what they wanted and is actually much better quality than anything we have purchased at Disneyland.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig.</li>
            <li> is the closest I could get in a picture to the real color.</li>
            <li> However, it was really windy</li>
            <li> And the hair kind of falls out, Only a tiny bit though</li>
            <li> One of the very few wigs I own that is actually large enough to fit on my head.</li>
            <li> i was expecting a dark blonde, but this is more like a light brown.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this was a very high quality wig!  </li>
            <li> its also super curly, unlike many other similar wigs that I have bought.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because it does get messy pretty easily</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than the picture it is more a golden blonde</li>
            <li> It is full and long.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer and generally resign myself to go through multiple wig purchases for each costume, trying to find just the right one that would work for the character.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty wig, but not blonde as described.  </li>
            <li> It came in really small packaging which i was confused by, but the wig it awesome!</li>
            <li> only problems really were that the curls frizz up pretty easily especially if you&#x27;re moving it around a lot</li>
            <li> The wig cap is well made, with a full lace interior and a soft forehead section, complete with side tabs to help you center the wig on your head.</li>
            <li> (that being said it is also a 14 year old using it)  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when it came in the mail, it was a completely blonde-yellow color.</li>
            <li> Was originally buying this as a spare for a costume and now it&#x27;s one that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and one who specializes in extensions, so I know hair from synthetic to high dollar human Remy.</li>
            <li> The photo they have provided is pretty close, just a little bit less orange and more strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice honey blonde, similar to the pictures, thick</li>
            <li> So, my conclusion: order blonde, and you may get any color from dark brown to light yellow.</li>
            <li> This wig is a major winner in all of those categories.</li>
            <li> The long bangs in the front are perfect for cutting and styling, but could also be left as long, face-framing layers.</li>
            <li> expensive that weren&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li> Even though it was the wrong color, its very soft and the curls in my opinion were even better than in the picture.</li>
            <li> Thick enough that I could put it in low ponytails without any bald spots, and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> it went halfway down my back and held its curls pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried it would be too small, and it needed breaking in, but i still love it.</li>
            <li> Also, the front part hung in my eyes a little too much.  </li>
            <li> It is however much darker than pictured, more of a dirty blond or dark strawberry blond.</li>
            <li> or at least, for me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wig a year ago for a Taiga (Toradora) cosplay (my first cosplay).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig doesn&#x27;t look as natural on my skin color, since I have naturally black hair and my skin color</li>
            <li> And I also noticed other reviews claimed that the blonde wig was actually DARKER then in the picture.</li>
            <li> i love the length and the thickness with the curls, but the color was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is a bit long for me, so will gut it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27; a long wig.)  </li>
            <li> really long bangs</li>
            <li> but the bangs are really really long.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful this would be a good one since is</li>
            <li> The blonde is slightly lighter than pictured, which is actually what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Really thick, long, and high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> but they can&#x27;t be left down or else they will cover all of your face.</li>
            <li> I would say the color is a bit less red</li>
            <li> My student is about 5&#x27;5&#x27; and it comes to her waste in the back.  </li>
            <li> The bangs are a little long</li>
            <li> The only complaint that i have is it is WAY darker than what is pictured...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and long-</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy other wigs from this seller!</li>
            <li> The color of the dark blonde/light brown has more of an ash tone (green hue base).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Halloween costume (Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls), and it arrived very quickly (less than a week).</li>
            <li> Being that this is synthetic hair and the price it lists for, I was half expecting a costume wig that I would spend time fussing with...</li>
            <li> The wig can look a little shiny in photographs.</li>
            <li> And color was a little darker than I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> and it got a little messed up</li>
            <li> Oh btw I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> A few strands came out, but nothing life threatening.</li>
            <li> My skin prefers colors that have a blue base so that was the only part that put me off but has nothing to do with the quality of the wig.  </li>
            <li> But, I wouldn’t recommend brushing through those thick bundles of curls, I haven’t tried to use a flatten iron on it as of yet.</li>
            <li> and that the part looks a little fake, but these are common problems with wigs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to dress like Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel fake at all!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice wig, shipping took a little longer than I like.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on Halloween when I wore this.</li>
            <li> I am a theatre teacher so i buy a lot of wigs.  I was doubtful this would be a good one since is was so inexpensive.  That being said it is BEAUTIFUL!  Way better than I thought it was going to be.  It is full and long.  It has a higher quality wig cap sewn into it.  My student is about 5&#x27;5&#x27; and it comes to her waste in the back.  It is curly and bouncy.  We are useing it for Sleeping Beauty and it is perfect.  I took off one star because it does get messy pretty easily (that being said it is also a 14 year old using it)  i would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for the price. I bought this for my Halloween costume (Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls), and it arrived very quickly (less than a week). Thick enough that I could put it in low ponytails without any bald spots, and easy to take care of. The color is slightly more bright than the picture. I cut it a bit without any issues, either. Lovely wig overall c:</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great quality for the price. Because it is synthetic it does tangle easy, but it also brushes out nice. Not to much shedding. Make sure you have a wig brush. Have received a ton of compliments on it(no one knows it&#x27;s a wig!!!). Bought others in different colors. Have totally recommended to a friend. Oh btw I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful wig, especially for the price. It is a bit long for me, so will gut it. However, I have had wigs&lt;br /&gt;more expensive that weren&#x27;t as nice. I absolutely love it. What&#x27;s more, it is almost identical to the color&lt;br /&gt;of hair I was born with. I hoped it would be, and it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a amazing wig. Its kind of darker than the picture itself but I love it that way. Beautiful curls, and it fits perfect!  Yet the hair is easily tangled, (Can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27; a long wig.)  And the hair kind of falls out, Only a tiny bit though</li>
            <li> Amazing fullness for the price. Great length and color.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this was a very high quality wig!  It&#x27;s very heavy and long- it went halfway down my back and held its curls pretty well.  I used it to dress like Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones.  It has a built-in wig cap that fit pretty snug and held the wig in place.  The reason for the 4 stars is only that the wig got really warm (maybe because I had a thick knot of my own hair underneath it), and it got tangled pretty easily, which I would just finger-comb through.  Also, the front part hung in my eyes a little too much.  other than that, great quality!</li>
            <li> WARNING: THE COLOR IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..or at least, for me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wig a year ago for a Taiga (Toradora) cosplay (my first cosplay). The picture displays the perfect light brown for Taiga&#x27;s hair. HOWEVER, when it came in the mail, it was a completely blonde-yellow color. I looked at the reviews again and I noticed that in customer pictures, the blonde wig was more like in the picture, a nice light chestnut brown. And I also noticed other reviews claimed that the blonde wig was actually DARKER then in the picture. So, my conclusion: order blonde, and you may get any color from dark brown to light yellow.

Even though it was the wrong color, its very soft and the curls in my opinion were even better than in the picture. At my first AX, loads of people still recognized me as Taiga from Toradora, so overall, I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Oh my!  This hair unit is very FULL, it seems like it might be even longer than described but maybe because it was so much hair.  I found that it fits very well on my XL head even with my full fro smashed underneath.  My friend with a smaller head also tried it and it overwhelmed her face.  The hair texture is great and very natural feeling.  There is enough hair to feel safe customizing the cut to suit your face and frame.  The color of the dark blonde/light brown has more of an ash tone (green hue base). My skin prefers colors that have a blue base so that was the only part that put me off but has nothing to do with the quality of the wig.  This would make a great mermaid, goddess, seductress, hollywood socialite look if you are costuming but also would work well for every day.  I would buy again if I could find the right color for my skin tone.  An impressive value for the amazing price (I bought at the right time I think).</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! A bit lighter than the photo, but I am still incredibly satisfied with the product and actually enjoy the blonde I received in person better than the display pic. One of the very few wigs I own that is actually large enough to fit on my head.</li>

I&#x27;d read the reviews on this one and the fast shipping. I received it two days later and the quality is amazing! It&#x27;s a nice honey blonde, similar to the pictures, thick so you can&#x27;t see the mesh through the hair and easy to style. Absolutely love this wig and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely gorgeous!! Well worth it for the price c: I used it for my honey lemon cosplay and I got lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;. its also super curly, unlike many other similar wigs that I have bought. I definitely would buy from here again.</li>

It was absolutely gorgeous as it was, and I couldn&#x27;t bear to chop off all those glossy, full curls. Long-story-short, I did cut it in the end, and it gave me the most spectacular, full short cut.

While this is what I was hoping for, and it looked just like the color in the picture (perfect for my cosplay), those expecting a light honey color or bleach blonde should order with caution.&lt;br /&gt;- The wig can look a little shiny in photographs. I recommend some colorless matte facial powder (I like MAKE UP FOR EVER&lt;br /&gt;HD Microfinish Powder), which should  take the shine right out.&lt;br /&gt;- If you plan on wearing it for a full day, I&#x27;d pretreat the ends with a light misting of the Mane N Tail Detangler, which should let you easily brush it through or finger-comb it throughout the day and keep it primed for an easy brushing when the day is done.t.&lt;br /&gt;- If you plan on wearing it for a full day, I&#x27;d pretreat the ends with a light misting of the Mane N Tail Detangler, which should let you easily brush it through or finger-comb it throughout the day and keep it primed for an easy brushing when the day is done.</li>
            <li> This wig is super soft and comfortable. it looks just like the picture and it&#x27;s amazing. Everybody loves my Serena cosplay now that I have this beautiful wig! Highly recommended. Can&#x27;t wait to buy other wigs from this seller!</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> The color is more of a natural blonde as shown in the photos but it turned out better than expected. Was originally buying this as a spare for a costume and now it&#x27;s one that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Really thick, long, and high quality for the price. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great wig. Arrived early then expected and the color is gorgeous. The color is a little darker than the picture it is more a golden blonde but I personally like the color more than the picture color. Overall a great wig and definitely recommended</li>
            <li> Great Wig!! I Was A Bit sketched out Because It Was So Cheap But When It Arrived It Was So Beautiful And Thick. I&#x27;ve Bought wigs More Expensive And This One Is Better Than Those!</li>
            <li> i got it two days after I ordered. It came in really small packaging which i was confused by, but the wig it awesome! A few strands came out, but nothing life threatening. Though it does tangle just a bit once its out, it is a really easy fix. I was a little worried it would be too small, and it needed breaking in, but i still love it.</li>
            <li> the wig is great. I used it for my taiga Aisaka cosplay. It kinda tangles easily but only when its rubbing against fabric</li>
            <li> The wig is very beautiful! It does not feel fake at all! But, I wouldn’t recommend brushing through those thick bundles of curls, I haven’t tried to use a flatten iron on it as of yet. It does tangle easily too, though - but that’s not a big issue for me. The color doesnt look like the one in the picture, its more of a soft light-ish blond (MUCH nicer than in the photo im my opinion)</li>
            <li> Good condition lovely curls really long bangs</li>
            <li> This is a very nice costume wig. It is pretty long on a 10 year old, which is what they wanted and is actually much better quality than anything we have purchased at Disneyland.  It is however much darker than pictured, more of a dirty blond or dark strawberry blond. Definitely not bleached blond as some customers received which is what I was hoping for and what the girls wanted.  Perhaps they just ship whatever shade of blond they happen to have in stock? But the girls tried them on and they love them anyhow so we are happy!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this wig! I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and one who specializes in extensions, so I know hair from synthetic to high dollar human Remy. Being that this is synthetic hair and the price it lists for, I was half expecting a costume wig that I would spend time fussing with...no problem it&#x27;s just for Halloween. Not so! Beautiful design in the cap, the hair itself is soft and workable, very mild tangling for a synthetic, and looks very natural. Very, very happy with this purchase! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the quality of this wig is very good. The only complaint that i have is it is WAY darker than what is pictured... i was expecting a dark blonde, but this is more like a light brown. i love the length and the thickness with the curls, but the color was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for an upcoming convention and I was not disappointed it is a little untamed, but after a little hairspray and trim of the bands its perfect. Looks and feels like real hair. Best wig I ever got from amazon</li>
            <li> Love love love !!! Hair is so soft, it&#x27;s full, and the length was perfect. I love that the bangs were long so I can style or cut them how ever I need them. The hair does feel like way better quality than regular costume wigs. Definitely worth what I paid. I got the two day shipping took a total of 4 days to get to me. And color was a little darker than I thought it was going to be I was thinking bombshell blonde and it&#x27;s more of a honey blonde. I still like it and is gonna work perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Wig is absolutely gorgeous! The blonde is slightly lighter than pictured, which is actually what I was hoping for. It&#x27;s the perfect color, the hair is soft and full, the curls look wonderful and aren&#x27;t tangled. The bangs are a little long but they work really well with how I was planning to style the wig!</li>
            <li> I really like this wig. I&#x27;d never had a wig before this, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality since it was so cheap. I would say the color is a bit less red then the photo, and the wig is a bit curlier. I found that the color is the exact same as my natural hair, which is nice as it suits my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first wigs I&#x27;ve ever ordered on amazon and I am so glad I did!! The curls are so gorgeous  and the color is very beauiful! The last photo I have of my mom in it is the closest I could get in a picture to the real color. The photo they have provided is pretty close, just a little bit less orange and more strawberry blonde. The first two photos I&#x27;ve included were just to show the style of the wig. The color is much more saturated than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 22 1/2 in. head and waist length hair so finding wigs beig enough to fit all of that is a real challenge but this wig fit me perfectly. I didn&#x27;t have to hook it any to get it to fit but there are hooks for those who have a smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is pretty accurate to the description but the bangs are really really long. This is good so you can trim them to how you&#x27;d like but they can&#x27;t be left down or else they will cover all of your face. I didn&#x27;t trim mine any; I just pinned mines up and it looks great like that alone! The part shown is shown in the middle but you can move the part to the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problems really were that the curls frizz up pretty easily especially if you&#x27;re moving it around a lot and that the part looks a little fake, but these are common problems with wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig doesn&#x27;t look as natural on my skin color, since I have naturally black hair and my skin color is pretty close to the color of the wig too, but people with lighter or darker tones than me would look great in it!</li>
            <li> Super heavy, but great quality considering it&#x27;s not human hair! The only issue I have is that the color is not as pictured. The hair is actually bleach blonde. Not the caramel color you see.</li>
            <li> NOT BLONDE!!!  This is a pretty wig, but not blonde as described.  This is more of a light reddish, brown color.</li>
            <li> Really great wig for the price. I wore it for a Halloween costume and it is really great quality for the price. However, it was really windy and it got a little messed up and i am not 100% sure how to fix the curls without ruining it. For the price it is definitely worth it. The color seemed true to the picture.</li>
            <li> This is a very adorable wig! It fits perfect! Thank you so much! Great product!</li>
