            <li>then im good to go.</li>
            <li>It works great, I just rub some on with my fingers then whipe the excess off then apply my balm then my lip stick (even the most drying of lipstick)</li>

            <li>Cute lipstick container.</li>
            <li>Very sugary, but it does a great job when you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>You are better off with a lip exfoliate you can make with sugar and oil.</li>

            <li>My lipstick looks better and doesn&#x27;t feather when i use this first.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t cost me $20.00 or more.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to do many times</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really interesting is that despite the scrubbing, the bullet itself doesn&#x27;t disintegrate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found something wonderful for my craggy lips.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it works okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the everything</li>
            <li>An OK product.</li>
            <li>I have to use it more.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try decided I like exfoliant creams better</li>
            <li>all twelve agree it is the best for keeping the skin soft and smooth on the lips</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent as well as the taste when I accidentally licked my lip.</li>
            <li>The smell was great but didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite for exfoliating my lips.</li>
            <li>it is ok for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>A pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I loved the results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>, it also has great ingredients in it, for 3$ its sooo very worth a shot, if you don&#x27;t like it,your not out much, I love it so much I hoard these,all in all an excellent lip balm /exfoliator for dry cracked lips.</li>
            <li>It works awesome for the dry skin on the lips.</li>
            <li>Left my lips super smoth and had a great flavor!</li>
            <li>It does a great job at sloughing off any excess skin and it leaves your lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>the way that the sugar feels against your lips is amazing &amp; I would recommend this product especially since it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li>The flavor is a bit too strong for me as well.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth more.  </li>
            <li>I have continued to use this even though I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything and have suddenly noticed a great deal of improvement.</li>
            <li>The whole stick kind of fell off after a day of use but its still usable</li>
            <li>My lips feel as smooth as ever and well excoriated.</li>
            <li>The granules of sugar do a good job at exfoliating and the Shea makes them soft</li>
            <li>OMG I love this product so much it makes my lips feel so much smoother &amp; it smells good..</li>
            <li>It exfoliates perfectly and does not leave lips raw.</li>
            <li>As much as I love amazon, I like paying less for some things, too.&lt;br /&gt;The product works very nicely.</li>
            <li>so it does a great exfoliation , would recommend this to anyone for smooth pink lips</li>
            <li>This is a awesome drugstore find,as I&#x27;m on my 4th one,to me this is a must have in the winter, I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry lips, my 16yr old daughter is now hooked on it also, it does an excellent job at moisturizing my lips and exfoliating them at the same time,</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a great product until the 3rd day of use.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is too sweet; it&#x27;s quite a task to try and use it as it falls apart almost when you try to rub it onto your lips.</li>
            <li>Not working good enough</li>
            <li>Love it really works</li>
            <li>Being I use all high end products I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this brand.</li>
            <li>Just a note when using, make sure you don&#x27;t twist the stick up too high</li>
            <li>Smells good, and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Great for getting rid of dead winter lips through exfoliating and softening.</li>
            <li>its good to smooth the lips before lipstick application.. however after few applications it has taken in all sort of lip colors and solidified</li>
            <li>It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>There is even some brown sugar crumbs which not only taste good but make your pout that much yummier.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it, it broke right away</li>
            <li>And the price is right for the effectiveness and amount of use</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of grit from the sugar and softness from the balm.</li>
            <li>Love the scent very pleasnt and soft.</li>
            <li>Before I would use an old toothbrush to exfoliate my lips and this is much gentler and dose a better job.</li>
            <li>It dries up very fast and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Bought in January, and still have most of it left.</li>
            <li>I prefer to try out cheaper products first before spending a lot of money on</li>
            <li>It exfoliated my lips exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Makes your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This helps my chapped and flaky lips, but I&#x27;ve definitely tried better products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product , its very coarse</li>
            <li>Pretty neat, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wondered if there was residue from the first use (ugh) that contaminated the stick.  </li>
            <li>Taste good but doesn&#x27;t remove all dead skin</li>
            <li>Also, since the exfoliants in this aren&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to leave it on like a chapstick instead of removing it; it won&#x27;t feel gritty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited about that and will update this again later.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Was what I expected cute but not edible</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and has a moisturizer in it as well</li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>It stays perfectly straight and doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>Ddnt like it that much.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of dry crusty lips in a few minutes, also it tastes great</li>
            <li>And afterwards, my lips were perfectly smooth and not at all dry.</li>
            <li>I had instantly soft lips, buy buy rough patch. :)</li>
            <li>The stuff really helps prep my lips for lipstick, it takes all the dry skin off and leaves them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My significant other uses this and very please</li>
            <li>It starts off smooth but very quickly is worn down to the sugary rough particles which exfoliate your lips.</li>
            <li>and lol actually eat a dab, crazy but true</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to use very much, so I think this may last quite a while for me.  </li>
            <li>Even my Husband tried out this little magic stick and said it left his cracked lips soft - so a big winner for everyone in this household plus the price is right!</li>
            <li>This is above the quality of some of the higher end brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but only after I tried some other lip scrubs to see if they are better.</li>
            <li>But makes your lips soft..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes all the dead skin and preps lips for a smooth canvas.</li>
            <li>Helps makes lips soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target instead of on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Target sells e.l.f. professional Lip Exfoliator for $3.00.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves your lips SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li>my lips get dry thanks to mate lipstick but using this product before my lipstick aplication is the solution!  </li>
            <li>no mess.  </li>
            <li>I get some flaky patches on my lips that my daily facial scrub doesn&#x27;t remove (it&#x27;s a bit too gentle for that)</li>
            <li>I have dry lips when I least expect it and this really helps keeping them smooth.  </li>
            <li>but they are left feeling soft and</li>
            <li>Hurts a little, but hey beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li>It makes your lips really soft, but doesn&#x27;t really remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li>They are constantly dry and peeling, it&#x27;s been a lifelong problem, but this does absolutely nothing</li>

            <li> At first I thought this was a great product until the 3rd day of use.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is too sweet; it&#x27;s quite a task to try and use it as it falls apart almost when you try to rub it onto your lips.</li>
            <li> Not working good enough</li>
            <li> Love it really works</li>
            <li> Being I use all high end products I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this brand.</li>
            <li> Just a note when using, make sure you don&#x27;t twist the stick up too high</li>
            <li> Smells good, and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Great for getting rid of dead winter lips through exfoliating and softening.</li>
            <li> its good to smooth the lips before lipstick application.. however after few applications it has taken in all sort of lip colors and solidified</li>
            <li> It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> There is even some brown sugar crumbs which not only taste good but make your pout that much yummier.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it, it broke right away</li>
            <li> And the price is right for the effectiveness and amount of use</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of grit from the sugar and softness from the balm.</li>
            <li> Love the scent very pleasnt and soft.</li>
            <li> Before I would use an old toothbrush to exfoliate my lips and this is much gentler and dose a better job.</li>
            <li> It dries up very fast and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Bought in January, and still have most of it left.</li>
            <li> I prefer to try out cheaper products first before spending a lot of money on</li>
            <li> It exfoliated my lips exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Makes your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This helps my chapped and flaky lips, but I&#x27;ve definitely tried better products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product , its very coarse</li>
            <li> Pretty neat, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wondered if there was residue from the first use (ugh) that contaminated the stick.  </li>
            <li> Taste good but doesn&#x27;t remove all dead skin</li>
            <li> Also, since the exfoliants in this aren&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to leave it on like a chapstick instead of removing it; it won&#x27;t feel gritty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited about that and will update this again later.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected cute but not edible</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates and has a moisturizer in it as well</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> It stays perfectly straight and doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> Ddnt like it that much.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dry crusty lips in a few minutes, also it tastes great</li>
            <li> And afterwards, my lips were perfectly smooth and not at all dry.</li>
            <li> I had instantly soft lips, buy buy rough patch. :)</li>
            <li> The stuff really helps prep my lips for lipstick, it takes all the dry skin off and leaves them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this and very please</li>
            <li> It starts off smooth but very quickly is worn down to the sugary rough particles which exfoliate your lips.</li>
            <li> and lol actually eat a dab, crazy but true</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to use very much, so I think this may last quite a while for me.  </li>
            <li> Even my Husband tried out this little magic stick and said it left his cracked lips soft - so a big winner for everyone in this household plus the price is right!</li>
            <li> This is above the quality of some of the higher end brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but only after I tried some other lip scrubs to see if they are better.</li>
            <li> But makes your lips soft..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes all the dead skin and preps lips for a smooth canvas.</li>
            <li> Helps makes lips soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target instead of on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Target sells e.l.f. professional Lip Exfoliator for $3.00.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves your lips SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li> my lips get dry thanks to mate lipstick but using this product before my lipstick aplication is the solution!  </li>
            <li> no mess.  </li>
            <li> I get some flaky patches on my lips that my daily facial scrub doesn&#x27;t remove (it&#x27;s a bit too gentle for that)</li>
            <li> I have dry lips when I least expect it and this really helps keeping them smooth.  </li>
            <li> but they are left feeling soft and</li>
            <li> Hurts a little, but hey beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li> It makes your lips really soft, but doesn&#x27;t really remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> They are constantly dry and peeling, it&#x27;s been a lifelong problem, but this does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning or at night mainly but it can be used anytime you need to remove dead skin from your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that it contains aspartame, but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me since it is one of the last ingredients on the list and is likely miniscule.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry lips, and it clears it up in minutes</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> so your lips are not smooth but left dry.</li>
            <li> This was so rough that it felt like rubbing gravel onto my lips.</li>
            <li> I just wipe it off with a wet washcloth after I&#x27;ve scrubbed my lips vigorously.  </li>
            <li> but it dosnt work as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend doing it twice though and using a wet washcloth to wipe off in between.</li>
            <li> but make them feel less dry for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste, in fact, I noticed no taste at all other than a slightly sweet aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> This makes it not as messy and prettier than other lip scrub type products.</li>
            <li> so well my husband now uses it as well (although he wishes it looked less like a lipstick-</li>
            <li> I give it two stars mainly because it arrive in no time, but unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of dead skin and leaves your lips buttery.</li>
            <li> , i exfoliate with the lip product by running it across my lips then use my finger to do the rest( as not to waste product) once it&#x27;s exfoliated to my pleasure my use a,educated lip balm...</li>
            <li> I use a tissue to sloth the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> She always gets the one from Sephora usually.  </li>
            <li> I just wipe it off and apply my usually chapstick.</li>
            <li> however I suggest you don&#x27;t lick your lips while applying unless you want to eat your dead skin!</li>
            <li> No more peeling.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite grainy but it has a waxy, slightly creamy base so it isn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it does.  </li>
            <li> has a weird after taste but read the directions.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t doing anything for my sad lips.</li>
            <li> I know crazy combination</li>
            <li> Buy the 3 pack, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed!  </li>
            <li> As I pointed out my lips were in really bad shape.</li>
            <li> So painful that I had to throw out after one attempted use.</li>
            <li> so my lipstick doesn&#x27;t look horrible.</li>
            <li> I have to admit my lips are TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere where in store where they sold e.l.f products. I Absolutely love it. Reasonably priced. Cute lipstick container. Love the scent very pleasnt and soft. Best lip scrub lipstick. I need to buy this in bulk next time. Definely recommend</li>
            <li> Very sugary, but it does a great job when you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Lips stayed moist after use.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected cute but not edible</li>
            <li> This broke my lips instantly, it wasn&#x27;t for me. But smells amazing</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a great product until the 3rd day of use. It dries up very fast and doesn&#x27;t work. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. You are better off with a lip exfoliate you can make with sugar and oil.</li>
            <li> This is my nowadays best friend.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! It gently exfoliates and has a moisturizer in it as well so your lips are not smooth but left dry. Before I would use an old toothbrush to exfoliate my lips and this is much gentler and dose a better job. It works so well my husband now uses it as well (although he wishes it looked less like a lipstick- but oh well)</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife.  She loves it and says its the best one she&#x27;s used. She always gets the one from Sephora usually.  She says this is a better product.</li>
            <li> Worked great!  (Cheaper at Walmart though)</li>
            <li> Good product but you can get it at target a bit cheaper</li>
            <li> This helps my lip to be better I really love it</li>
            <li> I give it two stars mainly because it arrive in no time, but unfortunately it did not work for me. I love E.L.F products but this one just wasn&#x27;t good, it was no difference in my lips.</li>
            <li> The stuff really helps prep my lips for lipstick, it takes all the dry skin off and leaves them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rough. But makes your lips soft.. I know crazy combination</li>
            <li> This actually does exfoliate.  I was skeptical, but it does.  You don&#x27;t even need to use very much, so I think this may last quite a while for me.  It was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this and very please</li>
            <li> The best invention ever... Gets rid of dry crusty lips in a few minutes, also it tastes great lol!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> This lip exfoliator is awesome! I use it whenever my lips feel like they are starting to peel or if I&#x27;m going to wear lipstick that day. It does a great job at sloughing off any excess skin and it leaves your lips feeling soft and smooth. I&#x27;m a little surprised that it contains aspartame, but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me since it is one of the last ingredients on the list and is likely miniscule. Also, since the exfoliants in this aren&#x27;t overpowering, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to leave it on like a chapstick instead of removing it; it won&#x27;t feel gritty. The smell and taste of this is pleasant, and the in-store cost makes it a steal considering the quality.</li>
            <li> great idea.  So simple. Use at night and have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Ouch! This was so rough that it felt like rubbing gravel onto my lips. So painful that I had to throw out after one attempted use. Ouch!</li>
            <li> The best exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used. I have chronic dry lips, and it clears it up in minutes so my lipstick doesn&#x27;t look horrible. Smells good, and lasts long. Bought in January, and still have most of it left.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is too sweet; it&#x27;s quite a task to try and use it as it falls apart almost when you try to rub it onto your lips. Even more distressing is the taste. I ended up spitting out bits of sugar in my quest for softer lips. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> It works rally good. Plus, the smell is amazing ! So refreshing.</li>
            <li> Not working good enough</li>
            <li> Taste good but doesn&#x27;t remove all dead skin</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase again. Left my lips super smoth and had a great flavor!</li>
            <li> This works great!  My lips immediately felt smoother after just one use.</li>
            <li> LOVE e.l.f.&lt;br /&gt;This lip exfoliator is great. I bought mine at Target for $3.00 and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;It removes all the dead skin and preps lips for a smooth canvas. My lipstick looks better and doesn&#x27;t feather when i use this first.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone. The price is unbeatable and it gets the job done. .Another great product from e.l.f that didn&#x27;t cost me $20.00 or more. I prefer to try out cheaper products first before spending a lot of money on&lt;br /&gt;brand names that work the same or not as good.&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients and i DO NOT like that it has aspartame in it. I Do Not drink sodas,teas,juices,coffee etc so i Do Not Like substitute sweeteners.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,good thing i am not eating this stuff. lol.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips but they are left feeling soft and well moisturised after using this. It starts off smooth but very quickly is worn down to the sugary rough particles which exfoliate your lips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this scrape my lips! Maybe I have to do many times</li>
            <li> I love this product. It exfoliated my lips well, and my lips started getting lighter within a week. I use this twice a day and moisturizer after each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an MUA and this scrub is great. It gets rid of dead skin and leaves your lips buttery. I recommend always using these types of products before bed not before using lipstick/gloss. Being I use all high end products I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this brand.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome drugstore find,as I&#x27;m on my 4th one,to me this is a must have in the winter, I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry lips, my 16yr old daughter is now hooked on it also, it does an excellent job at moisturizing my lips and exfoliating them at the same time, Another plus is it actually tatses like sugar to me, I&#x27;ll apply and lick my lips and lol actually eat a dab, crazy but true, it also has great ingredients in it, for 3$ its sooo very worth a shot, if you don&#x27;t like it,your not out much, I love it so much I hoard these,all in all an excellent lip balm /exfoliator for dry cracked lips.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price!! Elf is hit or miss with some products but I must day this onesie a HIT! The granules of sugar do a good job at exfoliating and the Shea makes them soft, i exfoliate with the lip product by running it across my lips then use my finger to do the rest( as not to waste product) once it&#x27;s exfoliated to my pleasure my use a,educated lip balm... Holy smoooothh luscious lips!</li>
            <li> Great product for lips ..</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have dry lips when I least expect it and this really helps keeping them smooth.  Just a note when using, make sure you don&#x27;t twist the stick up too high or you could break it during use.  I like to keep mine low..  I&#x27;m sure women who are used to using lipstick know this, but I did not!</li>
            <li> A pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Great scrub. I use this and after I wipe it off I apply lip balm. My lips stay smooth! I love that is it is in own tube and I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers to apply!</li>
            <li> Great for getting rid of dead winter lips through exfoliating and softening. There is even some brown sugar crumbs which not only taste good but make your pout that much yummier. Even my Husband tried out this little magic stick and said it left his cracked lips soft - so a big winner for everyone in this household plus the price is right! Buy the 3 pack, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Helps makes lips soft.</li>
            <li> Scrub itself ranks 2/5. Not too shabby but nothing to rant and rave about either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product stays moist even days after use. Will ask for a refund because that&#x27;s just gross.</li>
            <li> Whoever came up with this concept is a genius! It exfoliates perfectly and does not leave lips raw. I use it in the morning or at night mainly but it can be used anytime you need to remove dead skin from your lips. And the price is right for the effectiveness and amount of use you&#x27;ll get out of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  What a lip treatment!  It exfoliated my lips exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I get some flaky patches on my lips that my daily facial scrub doesn&#x27;t remove (it&#x27;s a bit too gentle for that) and this worked like a dream!  It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste, in fact, I noticed no taste at all other than a slightly sweet aftertaste.  I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because sugar is used as the exfoliator in this product.  It&#x27;s quite grainy but it has a waxy, slightly creamy base so it isn&#x27;t irritating. I just wipe it off with a wet washcloth after I&#x27;ve scrubbed my lips vigorously.  What&#x27;s really interesting is that despite the scrubbing, the bullet itself doesn&#x27;t disintegrate.  It stays perfectly straight and doesn&#x27;t break.  And afterwards, my lips were perfectly smooth and not at all dry. I will use this product religiously once or twice a week.  I&#x27;ve finally found something wonderful for my craggy lips.  I definitely recommend this product.  You can find it at Target for $3 but it&#x27;s well worth more.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Makes your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This helps my chapped and flaky lips, but I&#x27;ve definitely tried better products. For the price, it works okay. The flavor is a bit too strong for me as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the everything but it dosnt work as expected</li>
            <li> An OK product. I have to use it more.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target instead of on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Target sells e.l.f. professional Lip Exfoliator for $3.00. As much as I love amazon, I like paying less for some things, too.&lt;br /&gt;The product works very nicely. Just the right amount of grit from the sugar and softness from the balm. I just wipe it off and apply my usually chapstick. I had instantly soft lips, buy buy rough patch. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent worker on lips</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try decided I like exfoliant creams better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product , its very coarse so it does a great exfoliation , would recommend this to anyone for smooth pink lips</li>
            <li> Love it really works however it is overpriced here try Walgreens 2.69. I ordered and gave to club members as thank you gifts all twelve agree it is the best for keeping the skin soft and smooth on the lips has a weird after taste but read the directions. I use a tissue to sloth the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it every day!</li>
            <li> Used only once and it did exfoliate my lips. I&#x27;d recommend doing it twice though and using a wet washcloth to wipe off in between.</li>
            <li> Love this. It works awesome for the dry skin on the lips. Hurts a little, but hey beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li> Pretty neat, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ddnt like it that much.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed!  Love this product.  Makes liquid lipstick look flawless if you use it before applying anything else to your lips :)</li>
            <li> its good to smooth the lips before lipstick application.. however after few applications it has taken in all sort of lip colors and solidified</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t doing anything for my sad lips. I have to admit my lips are TERRIBLE. They are constantly dry and peeling, it&#x27;s been a lifelong problem, but this does absolutely nothing but make them feel less dry for about five minutes. Maybe my expectations were too high?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I may have judged this too soon. As I pointed out my lips were in really bad shape. I have continued to use this even though I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything and have suddenly noticed a great deal of improvement. I&#x27;m pretty excited about that and will update this again later. So I&#x27;m changing this from two to three stars for now!</li>
            <li> The whole stick kind of fell off after a day of use but its still usable so I forgive e.l.f.! My lips feel as smooth as ever and well excoriated. It smells and tastes like brown sugar however I suggest you don&#x27;t lick your lips while applying unless you want to eat your dead skin!</li>
            <li> This is cheaper at Target and Drug Emporium,  but it&#x27;s a great product. Like a spa treatment for your lips. This is above the quality of some of the higher end brands I have used. Great scent and feel.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this product so much it makes my lips feel so much smoother &amp; it smells good..the way that the sugar feels against your lips is amazing &amp; I would recommend this product especially since it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li> Very nice, easy to apply. I feel a difference each time I use it, I use it even when I don&#x27;t need to exfoliate sometimes and I love the scent as well as the taste when I accidentally licked my lip. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would get rid of my peeling lips!</li>
            <li> Omg point blank this is perfect ....follow the simple steps and you will be fine!😊💋💄👍👌👄💯%🆒</li>
            <li> Smells great but that&#x27;s about it. The exfoliating beads don&#x27;t come off the stick and onto the lip. There&#x27;s just this watery oil left on your mouth. No good.</li>
            <li> The smell was great but didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells lovely!</li>
            <li> this is the product I have been looking for! my lips get dry thanks to mate lipstick but using this product before my lipstick aplication is the solution!  great easy to use... no mess.  Rwcomend it 100%</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite for exfoliating my lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate your lips without having to touch the scrub. Works great, not to abrasive and it smells and tastes great!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it, it broke right away</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. It makes your lips really soft, but doesn&#x27;t really remove the dead skin. You have to peel it off your lips</li>
            <li> I loved the results after the first use.  My lips were the smoothest they have ever been.  But when I returned to use the product the next time, the taste of the stick was revolting and I couldn&#x27;t stand to use it again.  I&#x27;ve wondered if there was residue from the first use (ugh) that contaminated the stick.  Perhaps one shouldn&#x27;t apply the stick to one&#x27;s lips but should remove material from it to apply?  But then shouldn&#x27;t there be instructions to that effect?  We shouldn&#x27;t have to guess how to apply it.  Anyway, it worked well once but couldn&#x27;t be used gain.</li>
            <li> it is ok for the price</li>
            <li> I like the it&#x27;s in a nice tube in the shape of lipstick. This makes it not as messy and prettier than other lip scrub type products. Also, it leaves your lips SOOOO soft. However, it can be a bit crumbly and you need to massage it over your lips with your fingers once it&#x27;s on anyways. It&#x27;s just okay. I would buy it again, but only after I tried some other lip scrubs to see if they are better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Does the job and the smell/taste is not distracting. Almost reminds me of a Shea butter scent. Apply some to your lips, and wipe it off. But do yourself a favor and save some $! Target sells this same product for $3.00!</li>
            <li> Great lip exfoliation for the price. It works great, I just rub some on with my fingers then whipe the excess off then apply my balm then my lip stick (even the most drying of lipstick) then im good to go. No more peeling.</li>
            <li> When I recived this product it was broke</li>
            <li> It crumbled and fell apart as soon as I started to use it.</li>
