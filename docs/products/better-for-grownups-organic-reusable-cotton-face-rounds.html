            <li>Better for Grownups Organic Reusable Cotton Face Rounds...</li>
            <li>I also love the colours, they cheer me up when using them.</li>
            <li>No annoying cotton balls sticking to his face!  </li>
            <li>Love these cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>is that you pour your toner on, and the liquid sits on top of the material</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there&#x27;s an alternative to disposable cotton pads.</li>
            <li>They are also more absorbent and don&#x27;t soak through as easily.</li>
            <li>The more you use the more waste you create and the more money you spend which brings me to these awesome reusable pads.</li>
            <li>I saw other reviewers complain about the size, but I thought the size was perfect!  </li>
            <li>easy cleanup too with the laundry bag...</li>
            <li>The cotton rounds have a good size, are very soft and easily washable.</li>
            <li>We will never need to buy cheap cotton rounds again.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>Smaller amounts going to the landfill is always good.</li>
            <li>These reusable cotton rounds aren&#x27;t simply better for the environment, they actually work better than balls or disposable rounds, because they don&#x27;t shed fibers or pull apart.</li>
            <li>These Organic Rounds are so soft, I love the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>They are soft and absorbant and work great for cleaning off nail pollish and all types of facial makeup including mascara.</li>
            <li>these are the softest and are well worth every penny...</li>
            <li>I just swish them in soapy water and lay flat to dry--very easy!)</li>
            <li>These are huge and soft.</li>
            <li>First, I like that I&#x27;m not putting cotton on my face</li>
            <li>the color side is pretty.</li>
            <li>And finally, I just love that these are reusable.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little larger than necessary and likely suck up more product because of it, but they&#x27;re so soft and do a wonderful removal job.</li>
            <li>I purchased these after seeing a mention in Whole Body Magazine.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but I know it&#x27;s substantial because they become saturated so quickly and it easy to use a few at a time to remove polish or apply toner to you face.</li>
            <li>When I notice I&#x27;m getting low on clean ones, I wash them.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than continually buying conventional cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>These pads are easy to wash (so far I&#x27;ve only washed them by hand...</li>
            <li>BUT, I will say that I love having these little rounds.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re softer, much more durable, and don&#x27;t leave little cotton strands clinging to eyelashes when used to remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>So glad I upgraded and went green.</li>
            <li>I was running low on cotton pads and had trouble finding nice ones.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about this product is tha more than one tends to fall out of the box when you open it, but this is a minor problem.</li>
            <li>I am happy these came with a a reusable bag to store the dirty ones.  </li>
            <li>Each pad is two pieces of soft organic cotton sewn together.</li>
            <li>they are wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>so soft.</li>
            <li>, the organic cotton is soft with sturdy stitching, and I appreciate how the box talks about how organic cotton is safer for the workers who pick our cotton.</li>
            <li>I like having these soft cotton washable ones that I can reuse.</li>
            <li>and I allowed them to air dry (to save on energy, not so much because I think they would shrink)</li>
            <li>and although they are a little pricey they are well worth it because eventually they will pay for themselves</li>
            <li>The material is soft enough to use on the skin around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a cool dispenser box that you can reuse made out of thick cardboard.</li>
            <li>I can only recommend this product to anyone, who is aware of the waste we are producing every day and who values organically grown products.</li>
            <li>a little luxury in the morning that really comes back to not throwing another cotton ball in the trash and landfill...</li>

            <li> It seems a little expensive at first, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> They are soft and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting little fibers caught in my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is it is going to take me 3 years to break even on the cost of these vs. the cost of disposable rounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to handle and hold the whole round in one hand, so I fold it to make it easier and not flop around.</li>
            <li> Maybe to wet and then rub over my face to freshen up.  </li>
            <li> They are about the size of a regular cotton round.</li>
            <li> The cotton is thick and feels like a soft towel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a problem because the liquid product I put on it just soaks to the other side</li>
            <li> (if he uses toner)other then that I can&#x27;t think of a down side to having these.</li>
            <li> Seems a little pricey at 1st, but it will make you feel oh-so-good to know you never have to buy cotton balls again.</li>
            <li> They even come with a little baggie to wash them in.</li>
            <li> You will want to wash before using or they leave little fuzzies behind on your face and especially on your mans stubbly face</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s treated with tons of pesticides, bleach and chemicals (as is the case with any non-organic cotton ball or round).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably hand wash these since I have so few whites and it takes me months to accumulate a load-ful.  </li>
            <li> Just another way to prevent waste while saving money.</li>
            <li> The box is thick, sturdy, and water resistant if you want to keep using it, or in my case, I put the rounds in a little decorative glass vase.  </li>
            <li> The stitching seems sturdy, but not scratchy or too thick.</li>
            <li> I also like it that they came with a delicate bag that the dirty ones can be both sotred in and washed in, although I would reccomend allowing them to dry out after use before plancing them in it to prevent mold or mildew growth.</li>
            <li> A little mesh bag is included to collect the dirty rounds and keep them all together for the washing machine.</li>
            <li> Plus you don&#x27;t ever get the random hard bits that sometimes come in disposable cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li> And, they absorb, but since they&#x27;re so thin</li>
            <li> They may seem expensive, but they come out to &#x27;bout $1 per pad, and you can use them over and over again.</li>
            <li> so I wash them with my towels in cold water (again to save energy).</li>
            <li> Annoying as all heck.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> What a wonderful idea. Each pad is two pieces of soft organic cotton sewn together. The stitching seems sturdy, but not scratchy or too thick. The best part is you aren&#x27;t adding to landfills by throwing away disposable cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They absorb astringents and make-up removers well. The material is soft enough to use on the skin around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came with a mesh bag and I just keep it hanging next to my vanity and toss them in the bag after I use them. When I notice I&#x27;m getting low on clean ones, I wash them. There are 30 in this box, and I typically only use one per day, so I only have to wash them about once a month. Very easy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my reusable cotton rounds.  I think they are nicer to use than disposable rounds. They are soft and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting little fibers caught in my eye lashes.  Plus you don&#x27;t ever get the random hard bits that sometimes come in disposable cotton rounds.  The only down side is it is going to take me 3 years to break even on the cost of these vs. the cost of disposable rounds.</li>
            <li> These reusable cotton rounds aren&#x27;t simply better for the environment, they actually work better than balls or disposable rounds, because they don&#x27;t shed fibers or pull apart. They are also more absorbent and don&#x27;t soak through as easily. After I use one, I toss it into the included string bag, which I hang from a doorknob, and then on laundry day the bag goes into the wash--easy-peasy! A brilliant product!</li>
            <li> I got these to replace the disposable cotton face rounds I&#x27;d been buying in the drug store. First, I like that I&#x27;m not putting cotton on my face that&#x27;s treated with tons of pesticides, bleach and chemicals (as is the case with any non-organic cotton ball or round). I also like that I&#x27;m not throwing away several of these a day. These Organic Rounds are so soft, I love the feeling on my face. But, for me, they&#x27;re just too big. I&#x27;d like it if they came out with a smaller size. It&#x27;s hard for me to handle and hold the whole round in one hand, so I fold it to make it easier and not flop around. And, they absorb, but since they&#x27;re so thin it&#x27;s not a problem because the liquid product I put on it just soaks to the other side and I use it on both sides so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m finished using it, I put it in the bag they provide (which I keep in my bathroom) and wash them together in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> Better for Grownups Organic Reusable Cotton Face Rounds are an excellent alternative to disposable makeup remover pads. They are soft and absorbant and work great for cleaning off nail pollish and all types of facial makeup including mascara. I also like it that they came with a delicate bag that the dirty ones can be both sotred in and washed in, although I would reccomend allowing them to dry out after use before plancing them in it to prevent mold or mildew growth. The only thing I do not like about this product is tha more than one tends to fall out of the box when you open it, but this is a minor problem. Over all, a great, eco concious product.</li>
            <li> something so simple...genius. they are wonderfully soft. great for toner. great for removing eye makeup. so soft. I just ordered a second set...so i always have them on hand...easy cleanup too with the laundry bag...though the box dispensor is nice, i stuff mine in a glass container...the color side is pretty. try them. a little luxury in the morning that really comes back to not throwing another cotton ball in the trash and landfill...</li>

So glad I upgraded and went green.</li>
            <li> By far the best ............Better for Grownups Organic Reusable Cotton Face Rounds...these are the softest and are well worth every penny...no others are this quality!~</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this product to anyone, who is aware of the waste we are producing every day and who values organically grown products. It seems a little expensive at first, but it is definitely worth it. The cotton rounds have a good size, are very soft and easily washable. I also love the colours, they cheer me up when using them. I definitely don&#x27;t regret buying them!</li>
            <li> I saw other reviewers complain about the size, but I thought the size was perfect!  The box is thick, sturdy, and water resistant if you want to keep using it, or in my case, I put the rounds in a little decorative glass vase.  The cotton is thick and feels like a soft towel.  I use them to apply toner to my face or to remove makeup.  When you&#x27;re done you can soak them in water and it doubles as a wash cloth!  My husband loves to use them over his beard to apply his Tend Skin.  No annoying cotton balls sticking to his face!  They wash out great, no staining!  And finally, I just love that these are reusable.  We will never need to buy cheap cotton rounds again.</li>
            <li> Love these cotton rounds.  Like others said, they are bigger than I thought they would be and are ultra-soft.  I am thrilled to have found an alternative to wasteful one-time-use cotton rounds.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These are just great to have and I am glad that I bought them.  Been using them about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that you pour your toner on, and the liquid sits on top of the material, it does not absorb in.  Annoying as all heck.  So, I fold it in two and make it absorb.  I don&#x27;t like that.  BUT, I will say that I love having these little rounds.  Maybe to wet and then rub over my face to freshen up.  I do like them, I just don&#x27;t like the lack of absorption.  That is a problem, otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> Seems a little pricey at 1st, but it will make you feel oh-so-good to know you never have to buy cotton balls again. They&#x27;re a little larger than necessary and likely suck up more product because of it, but they&#x27;re so soft and do a wonderful removal job.

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I really love these! They&#x27;re super soft and absorbent. I&#x27;ll never buy disposable cotton rounds or cotton balls again. These are great!</li>
            <li> These are awesome for removing makeup and they wash so well!</li>
            <li> These are so much better than continually buying conventional cotton rounds. They&#x27;re softer, much more durable, and don&#x27;t leave little cotton strands clinging to eyelashes when used to remove eye makeup.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I think this product is as ingenious as most good ideas are. I don&#x27;t want to imagine what I&#x27;ve spend over the years buying cotton rounds and cotton balls but I know it&#x27;s substantial because they become saturated so quickly and it easy to use a few at a time to remove polish or apply toner to you face. The more you use the more waste you create and the more money you spend which brings me to these awesome reusable pads. They are about the size of a regular cotton round. I washed them with soapnuts and I allowed them to air dry (to save on energy, not so much because I think they would shrink) and although they are a little pricey they are well worth it because eventually they will pay for themselves and I already have to do laundry so I wash them with my towels in cold water (again to save energy). You will want to wash before using or they leave little fuzzies behind on your face and especially on your mans stubbly face (if he uses toner)other then that I can&#x27;t think of a down side to having these. They have a cool dispenser box that you can reuse made out of thick cardboard. They even come with a little baggie to wash them in. Just another way to prevent waste while saving money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for over a month now and have been very happy with them. I love the fact that there&#x27;s an alternative to disposable cotton pads. They may seem expensive, but they come out to &#x27;bout $1 per pad, and you can use them over and over again. These pads are easy to wash (so far I&#x27;ve only washed them by hand...I just swish them in soapy water and lay flat to dry--very easy!), the organic cotton is soft with sturdy stitching, and I appreciate how the box talks about how organic cotton is safer for the workers who pick our cotton. Even the box is reusalbe and recyclable...this is a great product and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want to keep buying cotton balls all the time. Easy to use and to clean. Would recommend it for anyone not wanting to spend a lot and enjoys organic items!</li>
            <li> I use alot of cotton rounds for makeup removal and application. I like having these soft cotton washable ones that I can reuse. Toss in with whites, and good to go. Smaller amounts going to the landfill is always good.</li>
