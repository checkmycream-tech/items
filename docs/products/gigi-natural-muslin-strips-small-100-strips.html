    <ol>
            <li>They are the perfect size for eyebrows and lip waxing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy!!!!</li>
            <li>Great strips to get your waxing needs done.</li>
            <li>Really good, I liked it</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the return/product policies.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>i ordered it by Amazon and satisfied with the product as always.</li>
            <li>Could be better.</li>
            <li>My favorite waxing strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other strips, and don&#x27;t need to since these work perfectly!</li>
            <li>Best muslin strips, the pieces grip hair firmly unlike cloth.</li>
            <li>so I use the front and back and get a great value.</li>
            <li>The strips I received were not in original packaging, but in a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>Love the size of these strips for waxing the larger areas - too big for upper lip but perfect for below the lip and chin area</li>
            <li>I used them with my hot waxer all the time.  </li>
            <li>these strips are ok the only problem is that the wax goes through and the wax gets all over your fingers</li>
            <li>They work very well!</li>
            <li>Although, they grip the wax and   hair very well.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i normally buy this at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply but there isn&#x27;t a near by store to my house</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had no problem with any portion of it so far.</li>
            <li>I use them along with the Moom Organic Natural Hair Removal Kit to wax my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect size for cutting down to use for eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li>Apparently the size I needed was petite.</li>
            <li>They are much wider than I expected</li>
            <li>Gigi Natural Muslin Strips are terrific.  </li>

            <li> Gigi Natural Muslin Strips are terrific.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these small strips along with a box of large strips.  </li>
            <li> Too small to really accomplish anything.</li>
            <li> and I have to cut them down to wax my eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be a little smaller</li>
            <li> The muslin leaves little bits of fabric all over my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> They are a little floppy, so I was scared they would not.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing strips to replace some I was out of and thought that the small ones would be the correct thing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to come off</li>
            <li> This is the only waxing kit I have tried, the only thing I dislike is these strips will allow the wax to seep through leaving hands sticky...not terrible and I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those guys whose going to give the not so subtle hint of her having a &#x27;stache by placing a wax kit in her lap.</li>
            <li> It does the job, it&#x27;s just a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and i was afraid i would run out before i have a chance to pass by the store.  </li>

            <li> Love the size of these strips for waxing the larger areas - too big for upper lip but perfect for below the lip and chin area</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. I was purchasing strips to replace some I was out of and thought that the small ones would be the correct thing. Apparently the size I needed was petite. They are much wider than I expected and I have to cut them down to wax my eyebrows and upper lip. It does the job, it&#x27;s just a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Too small to really accomplish anything. Although, they grip the wax and   hair very well.</li>
            <li> This is the only waxing kit I have tried, the only thing I dislike is these strips will allow the wax to seep through leaving hands sticky...not terrible and I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but overall got the job done.</li>
            <li> Gigi Natural Muslin Strips are terrific.  I used them with my hot waxer all the time.  They are the perfect size for eyebrows and lip waxing.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> these strips are ok the only problem is that the wax goes through and the wax gets all over your fingers and if you don&#x27;t have wax remover it&#x27;s hard to come off</li>
            <li> Best muslin strips, the pieces grip hair firmly unlike cloth. Muslin is textured on both sizes so I use the front and back and get a great value.</li>
            <li> 2 issues w/this.  The muslin leaves little bits of fabric all over my eyebrows.  Be sure to read the return/product policies.  The strips I received were not in original packaging, but in a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> Great strips to get your waxing needs done.</li>
            <li> They work very well! They are a little floppy, so I was scared they would not. But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> These were part of a waxing kit that was a gift for my wife. This gift was bought at her request - I&#x27;m not one of those guys whose going to give the not so subtle hint of her having a &#x27;stache by placing a wax kit in her lap. She&#x27;s had no problem with any portion of it so far.</li>
            <li> I like these muslin strips for waxing and have used them for years. This is the perfect size for cutting down to use for eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these small strips along with a box of large strips.  I use them along with the Moom Organic Natural Hair Removal Kit to wax my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years and I love it.  The wax sticks well to the strips.  I&#x27;ve never tried any other strips, and don&#x27;t need to since these work perfectly!</li>
            <li> i normally buy this at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply but there isn&#x27;t a near by store to my house and i was afraid i would run out before i have a chance to pass by the store.  i ordered it by Amazon and satisfied with the product as always.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be a little smaller but it still worked i cut it into smaller ones because i tried to wax my eyebrows</li>
            <li> i purchased this product with the Gigi muslin strips and I&#x27;m so happy!!!! Im gonna be saving a lot of money by not going to the nail ship to get my upper lip waxed now!!!! so content with all Gigi products.</li>
            <li> Really good, I liked it</li>
            <li> Could be better. Doesn&#x27;t pick up ALL the wax</li>
            <li> My favorite waxing strips. Always my go to.</li>
