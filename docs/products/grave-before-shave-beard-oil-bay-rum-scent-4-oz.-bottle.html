            <li>Great beard oil and great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and keep your beard looking good</li>
            <li>My beard smells great, feels like a soft pillow, and best of all, my face feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, a fair price.</li>
            <li>I liked the eyedropper as well.</li>
            <li>Light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is some lovely stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and the product is top notch.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma of this oil</li>
            <li>I was psyched to receive this because I love bay rum, whether in shaving soap, body wash, shampoo or deodorant.</li>
            <li>Most beard oils fade a bit in an hour or two, but this stuff retains a fully potent scent after as many as 12 hours (and counting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>The Bay Rum is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I washed it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wish I could subscribe to it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>A better description might be Bay Vanilla.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a very pleasant and manly smell.</li>
            <li>I notified Fisticuffs and it was immediately replaced with such amazingly quick service, and it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Still pleasant regardless, but the scent not being the normal Bay Rum scent is why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I would actually rate this great stuff about 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li>Was happy the find this in the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>GBS makes an awesome product I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the meat of the matter.</li>
            <li>I did notice that there was no frizziness, no beard itch, just a nice soft beard.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Although I agree, I have smelled many Bay Rum products, and most of them smelled different from one another.</li>
            <li>Soaks in relatively quickly in my beard.</li>
            <li>This beard oil departs from that familiar &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; scent pretty dramatically.</li>
            <li>But when a young lady told me how handsome I was with one, I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to like - smells fresh and softens the beard.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps it soft and healthily looking.</li>
            <li>version, the price is right.</li>
            <li>The dropper means it&#x27;s easy to dispense just as much as you need -- which is only a few drops at a time for a full beard -- without waste or spraying it all over your mirror, leaving you free to get your cardio workout in a more enjoyable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantity-for-value is excellent and I&#x27;ll likely buy from these guys again.</li>
            <li>surprisingly crisp scent</li>
            <li>Stellar product and service.</li>
            <li>In my experience, things labelled &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; have had a pretty darn consistent scent profile.</li>
            <li>This was my first vetoer with GBS products and I felling love instantly.</li>
            <li>Just received my first bottle from this brand.</li>
            <li>all things considered, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase but will likely try another scent next time, as this particular scent didn&#x27;t match my expectations for how &amp;#</li>
            <li>The scent, which (to me) comes across with a strong anise note, lasts a SUPER long time!</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle smell and absorbs very quickly into the beard.</li>
            <li>The scents are not to strong and just enough to have the ladies want to get close to smell your beard.</li>
            <li>My gal really likes the smell.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really soften my beard</li>
            <li>Do not over think it this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, and I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>Too much?  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Grave Before Shave Beard Oil</li>
            <li>When the USPS marked my order as &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; a full day before it was actually delivered (shame on the USPS!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a lot of scents, I mean very few, but this is delicious smelling.</li>
            <li>The original order I received got crushed in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Even my old dog gets flakey skin!  </li>
            <li>Used up my other bottle quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade out through the day and his beard is so soft now.</li>
            <li>When women like to run their fingers through your beard--and they do--they appreciate a soft, lush beard.</li>
            <li>The rubber eye dropper has either a defect or is old.</li>
            <li>Make my beard hairs really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent that reminds me of a traditional barber shop&#x27;s talc.  </li>
            <li>oil is a thin, light oil, which is exactly what you want for beards.</li>
            <li>Most beard oils come with those stroke-inducing plastic stoppers that mean you have to shake it with a violence equivalent to a 7.2 magnitude quake just to get a single drop to fly out in some random direction.</li>
            <li>This size of container should last me at least 6+ more months.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the USPS does this so often that their Customer Service has</li>
            <li>Wish they had something for my old short haired dog.</li>

            <li> The oil has turned my rough beard into very soft fur &amp; has done wonders on my dry skin &amp; beardruff.</li>
            <li> but it lays the hairs down on bad beard hair days and smells great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because my beard is usually a bit wiry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve transferred the beard oil to another container to keep the oil from going flat or losing scent.</li>
            <li> After only a few minutes of having applied the oil, my beard is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Would like the other scents in the larger bottles also.</li>
            <li> A small crack developed all around the cap part which allows the beard oil to leak out when I shake the bottle &amp; the leak won&#x27;t allow the eye dropper to function as it should.  </li>
            <li> Hands down its the only beard oil I will use.</li>
            <li> Definitely tamed the craziness down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on writing reviews.</li>
            <li> , Wayne at Fisticuffs was very understanding and ready to help if I got disappointed.</li>
            <li> During our looong winters here in AK it gets real dry especially in our house with forced air furnace.</li>
            <li> , I can wear dark shirts again &amp; not be embarrassed by folks  </li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;where&#x27;s my order?&amp;#34; question down to a science.</li>

            <li> owner&amp;#34; until a few months ago because of the irritation it had on my face.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use I already noticed the difference in my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> and it would get kind of nasty</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with excessive oiliness or a heavy, greasy or gummy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t have any bad things to say about it.</li>
            <li> The oils are not to thick either.</li>
            <li> Subtle hints of this and that.</li>

            <li> This is some lovely stuff. I don&#x27;t like a lot of scents, I mean very few, but this is delicious smelling. Subtle hints of this and that. It doesn&#x27;t fade out through the day and his beard is so soft now. I think he&#x27;ll be using this until he&#x27;s ashes.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and the product is top notch. I was never a &amp;#34;beard owner&amp;#34; until a few months ago because of the irritation it had on my face. But when a young lady told me how handsome I was with one, I decided to keep it. In came Grave Before Shave&#x27;s beard oil to save the day. My beard smells great, feels like a soft pillow, and best of all, my face feels fantastic! Love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on writing reviews. So I will say this. All of Grave Before Shaves Beard Oils are awesome. The scents are not to strong and just enough to have the ladies want to get close to smell your beard. The oils are not to thick either. Hands down its the only beard oil I will use.</li>
            <li> surprisingly crisp scent</li>
            <li> I would actually rate this great stuff about 4.5 stars. Love the smell, a fair price. It doesn&#x27;t quite condition my beard the way I like it so I add some jojoba oil to it. My gal really likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Used up my other bottle quickly. Was happy the find this in the larger bottle.  Would like the other scents in the larger bottles also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! !!</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of this oil but it doesn&#x27;t really soften my beard like I thought it would...but it lays the hairs down on bad beard hair days and smells great.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like - smells fresh and softens the beard.  Do not over think it this stuff is the real deal.  It&#x27;s also a great value for the budget conscience.</li>
            <li> It has already been stated that this doesn&#x27;t smell like Bay Rum, per se. Although I agree, I have smelled many Bay Rum products, and most of them smelled different from one another. The scent of GBS Bay Rum (to my nose) does have a bit of vanilla, and a *hint* of patchouli, but it is in no way overpowering. Overall, it is a very pleasant and manly smell. I was surprised by how much I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the meat of the matter. After only a few minutes of having applied the oil, my beard is incredibly soft. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because my beard is usually a bit wiry. When women like to run their fingers through your beard--and they do--they appreciate a soft, lush beard. This stuff is fantastic, and I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Grave Before Shave Beard Oil is a great oil for a great value. It has a nice subtle smell and absorbs very quickly into the beard. I did not have any problems with excessive oiliness or a heavy, greasy or gummy feeling.  I did notice that there was no frizziness, no beard itch, just a nice soft beard.  I wash my face a lot, and I am outdoors a lot. I have always used a lot of conditioner or pomades to look groomed. I liked the eyedropper as well. My previous experiences where guess and pour. Too much?  I&#x27;d have to rub it into my elbows or something. The customer service is also unbeatable. The original order I received got crushed in the mail.  It arrived as an oil soaked mailer envelope with a USPostal  Service plastic baggie around it. I notified Fisticuffs and it was immediately replaced with such amazingly quick service, and it arrived in perfect condition. Stellar product and service.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent that reminds me of a traditional barber shop&#x27;s talc.  Light and pleasant.  And with the 4 oz. version, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I was psyched to receive this because I love bay rum, whether in shaving soap, body wash, shampoo or deodorant. In my experience, things labelled &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; have had a pretty darn consistent scent profile. This beard oil departs from that familiar &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; scent pretty dramatically. In fact, I would never have guessed it might be called &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; had I smelled it before I saw the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a thin, light oil, which is exactly what you want for beards. The scent, which (to me) comes across with a strong anise note, lasts a SUPER long time! Most beard oils fade a bit in an hour or two, but this stuff retains a fully potent scent after as many as 12 hours (and counting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the dropper is an EXCELLENT touch! Most beard oils come with those stroke-inducing plastic stoppers that mean you have to shake it with a violence equivalent to a 7.2 magnitude quake just to get a single drop to fly out in some random direction. The dropper means it&#x27;s easy to dispense just as much as you need -- which is only a few drops at a time for a full beard -- without waste or spraying it all over your mirror, leaving you free to get your cardio workout in a more enjoyable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantity-for-value is excellent and I&#x27;ll likely buy from these guys again. When the USPS marked my order as &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; a full day before it was actually delivered (shame on the USPS!), Wayne at Fisticuffs was very understanding and ready to help if I got disappointed. Apparently the USPS does this so often that their Customer Service has the &amp;#34;where&#x27;s my order?&amp;#34; question down to a science. Turns out, the post office lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all things considered, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase but will likely try another scent next time, as this particular scent didn&#x27;t match my expectations for how &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; smells.</li>
            <li> Great product. The scent is everywhere but they do it well. Definitely improves the skin under the beard and the beard itch is gone. Scent goes all day and night.</li>
            <li> This beard oil is the bomb.  Really don&#x27;t have any bad things to say about it. I would have given 5 stars &amp; I don&#x27;t give 5 stars to any product period.  The rubber eye dropper has either a defect or is old. A small crack developed all around the cap part which allows the beard oil to leak out when I shake the bottle &amp; the leak won&#x27;t allow the eye dropper to function as it should.  I&#x27;ve transferred the beard oil to another container to keep the oil from going flat or losing scent. I do like the scent &amp; that&#x27;s why I purchased the larger container. The oil has turned my rough beard into very soft fur &amp; has done wonders on my dry skin &amp; beardruff. During our looong winters here in AK it gets real dry especially in our house with forced air furnace. Even my old dog gets flakey skin!  Thanks to Grave Before Shave Beard Oil, I can wear dark shirts again &amp; not be embarrassed by folks  giving me the stink eye cause I got flakes all over my chest. This size of container should last me at least 6+ more months.  I do recommend this product for sure. Wish they had something for my old short haired dog.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing and pirate-like scent. I&#x27;ve actually added rum and coconut beard balm to intensify the scent and get in touch with my inner pirate. Great beard oil and great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it daily on my beard which is about 6 months growth and it keeps it soft and healthily looking. The Bay Rum is my favorite scent. You have a customer for life. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Smells bomb, doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my colognes. Make my beard hairs really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. This was my first vetoer with GBS products and I felling love instantly. The Bay Rum smells and feels awesome. After just a few days of use I already noticed the difference in my beard and mustache. My wife has been begging me to shave because My beard was so unruly and it would get kind of nasty no matter how many times I washed it. Once I started using this GBS product, my wife began complimenting me on the look, feel and smell of my beard. I love this stuff and wish I could subscribe to it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Definitely tamed the craziness down!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and works well.</li>
            <li> GBS makes an awesome product I use it everyday. It smells great and keep your beard looking good I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just received my first bottle from this brand. The scent is light, in no way overpowering. Soaks in relatively quickly in my beard. Pleasent scent, but doesn&#x27;t resemble any Bay Rum scent I&#x27;ve ever had before. A better description might be Bay Vanilla. Still pleasant regardless, but the scent not being the normal Bay Rum scent is why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
