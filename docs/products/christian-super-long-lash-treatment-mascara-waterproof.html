            <li> I tried this mascara, and I would buy it again. I usually buy expensive mascara, just wanted to try something new.  It gives you long lashes, but I had to work on my lashes for a while. To get the effect I was looking for. If you don&#x27;t mind putting on three coats, it works really well. One great thing about this mascara ;if you wear your makeup to bed they look great the next morning...good tip if your wanting to look ,hot for your man in the morning...</li>
            <li> My friends use it and it look beautiful on their lashes ...but mine did not ... But try it what doesn&#x27;t work for some ..will for others</li>
            <li> so glad I found this mascara, was spending tons on designer mascara only to achieve the same effect. wish I could get this in stores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. You have to put a lot a product to see a diference, but It doesn&#x27;t work for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Worked like any other mascara. Its been about 6 months + since I bought it and my eyelashes are the same. NO difference</li>
            <li> love it seperates and lengthens my lashes beautifully</li>
            <li> Great product, will make your lashes look long and elegant. Does not smear when you sweat or shower. Love it!</li>
            <li> The only mascara that works , my eyelashes looks really big forget it about expensive mascara if u looking for quality this is the mascara you was looking for . I already order two more</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look fuller, my co worker even told me my eyelashes look really long n I don&#x27;t have many due to constantly wearing fake lashes love it... Also it arrived on time :)</li>
            <li> I had never used it and it was first time using it and I must say.... I love it! It makes my eyelashes look super long like no other mascara I had used. I will definitely buy again real soon</li>
            <li> gives you the longest lashes ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I will love waterproof special summer</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Totally worth it. I don&#x27;t use anything else...the brush separates the lashes no matter how many strokes you do.makes them look longer and last all day.</li>
