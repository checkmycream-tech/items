            <li> Great hand cream to use to treat really dry hands. I always keep tube of this cream near my nightstand at night to treat my hands during the winter. You don&#x27;t have to use too much to get coverage; just a dime size dot is fine. Within a few uses my dry hand issues were gone and with continued use through winter, my hands remained nice and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> La Source Hand Therapy is the best hand lotion I have ever used in my entire life.  Try it once and it will be your favorite.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  My skin just drinks it in and it smells crisp and clean.  I absolutely love it!  Well worth the cost and shipping.  My last 50 ml tube lasted for years since a little dab will do ya.  I&#x27;ve got other hand creams at home but I&#x27;m buying this one online because it&#x27;s that good.  I think a previous reviewer mixed up this product with another hand therapy product in this line which does what she described:  you rub it in and wash and it&#x27;s ultra moisturizing.  This is a hand cream -- not that.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It has become part of my life.  I have neuropathy in my hands, and massaging them with this cream really is therapy for me.</li>
            <li> I use to shop at this store BUT I moved...I am so glad I am able to get this fine product!!!</li>
            <li> I tried many hand lotions and this one I personally like the best so far. It helps my dry skin stay moist without feeling greasy in the winter.</li>
            <li> Best hand therapy there is.  The aroma is calming and the lotion is not greasy. Leaves your hands feeling silky smooth.  La Source scent is awesome ! This is always on my list for my nightstand and my friends enjoy receiving Crabtree and Evelyn products as gifts, always.</li>
            <li> I knew this product was good already. It&#x27;s like the third or fourth time I get it. Its great for the winter, and it&#x27;s a good size to carry around.</li>
            <li> I first found this by staying in a four star hotel in Chicago.  It has a god scent and softens my dry hands.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this light non-greasy lotion for my hands. It has a pleasant smell, lavender is soothing and good for sleep.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It is soothing, smells delightful, not greasy and really WORKS!!! I had several dry spots that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of until I used this product. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller then I thought it would be. And the bottle looked a little banged up when I got it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mother to give as gifts to her friends. We love this hand cream and so do they!&lt;br /&gt;]</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells.  When I run out I will buy more.  However, I will never buy the Fragrance Oil or Body Mist ~ they do not have the same fragrance as the Hand Therapy.</li>
            <li> PERFECT hand cream to keep in purse the fresh scent on top of the quality and lightness of the cream is super</li>
            <li> great item, very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the feeling of rubbing your hands ... It&#x27;s not greasy but silky ... It keeps my hands soft&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive but worth it ...</li>
            <li> It is provides perfectly non-greasy moisture with a light, clean fragrance.  It is my go-to purse/office lotion.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I should buy this by the case!  My niece gave me a tube as a gift and I&#x27;ve been sold ever since!  Fabulous hand creme. My hands work hard, but with this wonderful creme, they don&#x27;t look it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a nice hand cream, this is the one.  Scent is pleasant not overly strong.  Have very dry hands (winter).  This will my go to hand cream .</li>
            <li> this is the most AMAZING hand therapy I have EVER used!!!:) I also use it on my legs and arms and it&#x27;s GREAT!:) Recommended for anyone with dry skin from winter air!:)</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve used it when I received it as a gift from airline friend and to find more.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells AWFUL.  As in...I needed to wash my hands after I applied it because the smell was hideous.  I would describe it as a musty old house smell combined with old lady perfume. So, so, so bad... yuck.  I cannot imagine anyone smelling this on their hands and thinking, &amp;#34;Wow! this smells good!&amp;#34;  I know everyone has different scent preferences but this one just plain stinks.</li>
            <li> Excellent for softening and moisturising. The perfect hand cream with a lovely hint of a feminine scent. A perfect must have for all ladies and wonderful size options to fit into any bag or purse size.&lt;br /&gt;For me with tough palms it gets the softening job done.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion product around!  It truly makes my hands feel so good and  it smells great!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands soft and smooth.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that flowery smell that some hand creams have.</li>
