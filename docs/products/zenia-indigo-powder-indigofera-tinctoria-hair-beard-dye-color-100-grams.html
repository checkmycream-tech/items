            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I always use Dabur Vatika Coconut hair oil before color, making sure to get my hair good a saturated with it, then I apply the henna/indigo mixture.</li>

            <li>The good news is that my hair had a lovely aromoa of coffee.  </li>
            <li>really liked this product</li>
            <li>And I made sure to wash it out good.</li>

            <li>The indigo did an excellent job coloring my naturally 4 c hair and my relaxed hair</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Indigo and my color is now a beautiful glossy</li>
            <li>Looks nice though, and I just ordered three more packets of the 2012 crop</li>
            <li>I have one more pack to use and then that&#x27;s it ....</li>
            <li>Soak the Henna for more than 2-3 hours&lt;</li>
            <li>just how I love it....</li>
            <li>I love to color my hair</li>
            <li>For the most part, my hair has oil in it because I can comb throw it but its not greasy.</li>
            <li>I will leave it on more then the 3 hours it suggests.</li>
            <li>When the time comes,  I will gladly order again.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>There are many websites with advice on how to henna your hair (and U tube videos)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Zenia indigo powder.  </li>
            <li>It exceeding my expectations :)</li>
            <li>soaked Henna for more than 12 hrs, applied in my hair and kept it for 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this worked like magic, as if i colored my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair and looking at it in the mirror!!I</li>
            <li>Henna has so many benefits</li>
            <li>I love it product.</li>
            <li>so I could get better coverage.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase and will order again.</li>
            <li>if you want the indigo to show up the most, leave the henna on for a lllloongg time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so it will get better coverage</li>
            <li>the longer you leave it the better.</li>
            <li>going to try another seller on amazon for this and hope for better results</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>but I love the results of my henna</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS IN COMBO WITH THE NUPUR</li>
            <li>Good, I liked the natural look.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found the best chemical free color.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh, is very fine, so rinsing out is easy.</li>
            <li>Great all natural product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this, and it came super fast which is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best way to color my hair black that I found and I love</li>
            <li>My strain is usually a nice black with incredible luster.</li>
            <li>i have only good things to say about this!:</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly, and I used it in a day.</li>
            <li>So easy to do</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications.</li>
            <li>but this stuff makes your hair strong and shiny</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with the results and specially because I don&#x27;t have to go to the ER anymore.....</li>
            <li>search for pure organic indigo continues!!!</li>
            <li>I left it on for almost 2 hours and got great color</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone who is allergic to ppd in commercial hair dyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and free shipping !</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with going natural!</li>
            <li>I then applied the indigo and I ended up with the most beautiful black hair that was shiny and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past (along with henna - which I&#x27;m very satisfied with btw) and this Indigo does not do it for me at all!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Loved the ease of mixing the powder added coconut oil for extra moisture and work just fine..</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that it makes my hair more manageable, soft, has movement and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>This indigo has no PPD, shipped very quickly and was fresh.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an awesome and safe way to get jet black hair:)</li>
            <li>Well, old school works better and lasts longer!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Indigo, it&#x27;s very finely milled and works like a dream.</li>
            <li>I had beautiful dark chocolate brown hair.</li>
            <li>I used this just on its own, and now about 6 months later my hair is still black.&lt;br /&gt;It fades nicely, but do be aware that it will stain the shower if not cleaned up right away.</li>
            <li>This was easy to rinse out with water first.</li>
            <li>The result is a beautiful, non-artificial looking head of raven black hair.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how fresh and effective this indigo powder is.</li>
            <li>Though the gray was still covered, I was hoping that the indigo would not fade after shampooing as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I took equal parts of henna and indigo, and the result was just perfect - beautiful dark brown natural-looking color with 100% grey coverage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the results of the dark color and color on my greys.</li>
            <li>but I had brown dye on my relaxed ends and bright red greys from my first henna treatment.</li>
            <li>I used the  Indigo as a follow-up to my henna for Jet black hair good product that&#x27;s finely stiffed.</li>
            <li>It made it look more natural and effortless!</li>
            <li>Luckily, since this product is all natural, I was able to use a chemical dye over it with no problems.</li>
            <li>so i think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought indigo before but had success with this one.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much that I recently purchased the 500 gram size.</li>
            <li>it is worth the time and money....</li>
            <li>I could have lived with the smell if the color would have been right.  </li>
            <li>but I added some more indigo just to make sure the color would still be dark.</li>
            <li>My henna was the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram mixed with warm Goya coconut milk first.</li>
            <li>It IS 100% pure!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for Jet Black Hair - well good luck</li>
            <li>This was a very gentle coloring process for my hair.</li>
            <li>My first attempt turned my gray bright orangey-red and it was way too much of a contrast with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I did exactly that...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Many ppl said it was essential to use henna immediately before, but I henna-ed 1 month before and just decided to throw this stuff on anyway to see if it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad because now I have a darker color where as the henna left me with reddish highlights.</li>
            <li>so well, it left more of a residue.  </li>
            <li>I did not follow the instructions given by doing henna first.</li>
            <li>so that was pretty</li>
            <li>co-washed then gave myself and Olive Oil hot oil treatment with a heating bonnet for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This indigo did exactly what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>I did the two step process where I did a henna treatment first.  </li>
            <li>Had enough of the Indigo for about three more applications.</li>
            <li>least i haven&#x27;t experienced it yet).</li>
            <li>I used Jamila BAQ first then the indigo</li>
            <li>I mixed this with more henna</li>
            <li>It prob would have done even better if I had not mixed it with henna.</li>
            <li>I am willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>do your research about using indigo first ad</li>
            <li>I was using another vendor for Indigo and then their Indigo Powder went up higher than I wanted to pay.</li>
            <li>But overall ordering from this store for these products is fitting my budget.</li>
            <li>So when i use a cup of henna and a cup of indigo it just brings out the red in my hair more then anything.</li>
            <li>Did the two step process two days ago with Dulhan henna for the first time.</li>
            <li>I use Henna first and then the indigo.  </li>
            <li>I have to now resort to commercial hair color because I don&#x27;t have time to get more indigo.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered more</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get this product to work as described on the package.  </li>
            <li>I use 1-2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (for henna dye release), bottled water (for the henna and indigo); allow 12 hours for the henna to become full strength, mix the indigo, mix the henna and indigo together; the result is  soft, shiny, managable hair that is strong and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Chemical dyes have their own moisture from the ingredients but henna and indigo are dry from the start meaning they need moisture applied to really work.</li>
            <li>so if you love Black hair and want to try a more natural way....</li>
            <li>The stain was good and was able to turn my bleached and dyed purple hair back to my natural dark brown hair color (with this and henna.)</li>
            <li>the whole 100g pack), 1 tbsp of sea salt, almost hot water(helps the salt dissolve), 3 tsp of the Nupur henna, and 1 tsp of Guar Gum Powder(this</li>
            <li>This powder has a earthy smell and my hair did not come out as dark as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>Once I was done washing it out ( you will have to do twice and thoroughly) and blowing my hair dry, my hair was very soft and when i pressed my hair, the results were really nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of like seaweed, spinach, or maybe even a slight weedy scent</li>
            <li>This was cool at first giving me a rich dark luxurious look but after two-three washes the color was gone and in the first two-three days it rubbed off on my clothing and pillow.  </li>
            <li>no PPD, pure indigo powder.</li>
            <li>so I am wondering if this product was even pure or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in the 1st place?</li>
            <li>I loved the color , but it didnt last long really</li>
            <li>not knowing that I was really allergic to that stuff</li>
            <li>mix together when ready to use...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that worked</li>
            <li>After I try this 100g USAWHR Indigo Powder ,&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfy.</li>
            <li>It covers  gray hair really well...  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really like the color</li>
            <li>Then I had it on my hair for 10 whole hours.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely must dye your hair with henna first,the indigo sticks to the henna,</li>
            <li>I am very health conscience, and would not knowingly use anything harmful.  </li>
            <li>i am really upset.</li>
            <li>a natural hair dye gave me,the only thing that i should apply it again after almost 12 days which is ok with me since it is</li>
            <li>but it is better than other brand I have used I will use it till I find another one</li>
            <li>(it was the much raved about Red Raj, I just thought it was too cool toned for my coloring).</li>
            <li>The resulting color was a deep black and offered good gray coverage.  </li>
            <li>i then wrapped my head in a shower cap and let it sit for six full hours, two hours longer than stated on the package because i know indigo essentially works by staining and</li>
            <li>but I found less is more.</li>
            <li>My goal is to cover the gray mostly in the front half of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how black and shiny my hair is afterwards.</li>
            <li>i wanted to darken it more and get a black color without using chemicals.</li>
            <li>It stained really well, and the batch seemed fresh enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and feels really healthy from the total process after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I definitely would suggest not using and finding a different means to safely color your hair</li>
            <li>This product came in about two days, super fast, went right to work on my sisters hair, mixed this with Jamilah hennah powder for that extra brown look.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I was under the impression that this was a natural product and could cause no damage if it was in fact 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>This really worked on my natural kinky curls that were graying.  </li>
            <li>Long story short - this product works ok but ir may contain PPD.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>but since I have gone all natural for the first time in 14 years of having natural hair, I decided to try indigo to color it instead.</li>
            <li>and I simply apply the following mix of Indigo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indigo Powder mixed with warm water to help release the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The indigo itself was very fresh and well packaged and came sooner than the expected date.  </li>
            <li>My clients love the natural black color that is achieved when using this product.</li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying in order for this to properly dispose the right color(black)</li>
            <li>Works well, makes a nice color and the smell is nice,  though it does dry out the hair pretty bad</li>
            <li>Plus hair has a lot less frizz and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>You may add a few drops of essential oil to your Indigo to give it a nice smell.</li>
            <li>pretty much followed the directions to a T and didn&#x27;t even leave it in that long.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Next time I will use henna first, rinse then apply the indigo.</li>
            <li>I mixed it first by itself and did a strand test.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty gross</li>
            <li>you have to follow the instructions to the T. Prior to using this product, hair must be colored first with a henna powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying the henna first gives it something to bond onto and in my opinion helps it last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first i put henna mixed with sage tea and rosemary tea .next</li>
            <li>i generally avoid experimenting too much with my hair</li>
            <li>my hair was still the exact same shade, brown.</li>
            <li>It is just as effective as other more expensive brands I have used.</li>
            <li>It was purchased for cheap and since my hair does turn black I will give it 4 stars</li>
            <li>i followed the instructions for this product super carefully, twice in fact.</li>
            <li>It was a lovely shade of brown and had toned down a lot of red.  </li>
            <li>I was actually ordered more since it didn&#x27;t even turn my hair Jet Black but a darker richer brown.</li>
            <li>pure natural.i hope it would give the same result for whoever uses it.</li>
            <li>I searched for a very long time to find the right mix of natural henna to achieve the results.</li>
            <li>procedure above seems to work fine - it took me about 3-4 tries to work it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currenty 30yrs old...</li>
            <li>I really wish I could have left it on over night</li>
            <li>This is a natural way to darken my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is a natural 3b/3c texture....</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for people who are looking for that natural look.</li>
            <li>( I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair).</li>
            <li>first did henna for about 3 hours to cover my grey, then I dyed my hair with the Indigo</li>
            <li>I used my old heat cap.</li>
            <li>This Indigo Powder has been my go to Indigo powder to use along with my henna of choice in order to naturally color my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wanted a natural way to dye my permed hair to hide the grays.  </li>
            <li>so i thought a natural product would be just the solution for my needs.</li>
            <li>A must for after natural henna which takes out all the grey,but turns your hair orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe after another application the color will completely take.  </li>
            <li>(yeah it&#x27;s a bit old</li>
            <li>Mixed then let sit for 10 min till a blue/deep green glaze formed on the top.</li>
            <li>and it looked so healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>day i put one part henna with 2 parts of indigo mixed with sage and rose mary tea and grey hair was almost dark</li>
            <li>My hair is still not Black, but a brown of some shade.  </li>
            <li>I was actually in the middle of my first time using Henna on my hair</li>
            <li>Also, I just used a little bit of Indigo (just enough to color the hairline &amp; middle) &amp; mixed w/ warm water.  </li>
            <li>So a few days after my last application of henna I mixed up two tablespoons of this Indigo powder with enough warm water to form a yogurt-like consistency.</li>
            <li>then I saturated the rest, my hair is very curly but goes to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>I use warm water and Organic Olive Oil (First cold press, extra virgin) to mix it with.</li>
            <li>Though the dye came early, when I dyed my hair, it turned more of a green color, than an Indigo black.</li>
            <li>but I noticed the top was turning black after covering it for another half hour.  </li>
            <li>Mixed up really easy, I used water and a bit of salt, let it sit for 10 minutes then mixed it into henna I had mixed up two days previous.</li>
            <li>and I have had white hair since I was young....</li>
            <li>I used this as a hair dye; when mixed with henna powder it creates a natural brunette dye.</li>
            <li>I will always use this product sense it is all natural, and I&#x27;m allergic to commercial dyes.</li>
            <li>I did this until my whole head was wet to the consistency of aregular chemical dye.</li>
            <li>Helped me achieve a long lasting blue-black pretty color that stands up to washing and various styling products.</li>
            <li>The henna that I ordered was either old or the colorless/yellow product instead of the red henna.</li>
            <li>After talking with a friend of mine who has been doing her hair color with henna for years, I used hot black coffee instead of water, with the indigo.  </li>
            <li>Down side of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wash out the first time, second and maybe third.</li>
            <li>My medium brown hair naturally has a red tint especially in summer months.</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using the Lush henna bars, which are super messy, but decided to try the old school method of hennaing and compare.</li>
            <li>Then I started adding hot water from the sink by wetting my hands (sparingly), rubbing them together to get a little soupiness then applied to my head</li>
            <li>However, after my first shampoo following this treatment, the color was no longer jet black, but a brownish-red as the undertones from the henna began to blend in.  </li>
            <li>The grey hairs were completely covered.  </li>
            <li>I mixed 1 part Jamila BAQ henna with 2 parts Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder for a dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li>I reached a dark color leaning towards a rich black.</li>
            <li>I use 1/2 cup of henna and a whole cup or packet of the indigo for a deep, dark brown.</li>
            <li>I have used henna several times throughout the 14 years of being natural but I have never used Indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to cover my grey for a party this weekend</li>
            <li>For first time indigo buyers out there, know that indigo mixes up green and changes to blue.</li>
            <li>Once I had applied it all over, I quickly mixed up a small batch of the product making it a little more soupy than the one I had already applied.</li>
            <li>It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t apply Indigo Powder  to my whole hair,, just brush a little indigo powder in the place</li>

            <li> This was my first time using Indigo and my color is now a beautiful glossy</li>
            <li> Looks nice though, and I just ordered three more packets of the 2012 crop</li>
            <li> I have one more pack to use and then that&#x27;s it ....</li>
            <li> Soak the Henna for more than 2-3 hours&lt;</li>
            <li> just how I love it....</li>
            <li> I love to color my hair</li>
            <li> For the most part, my hair has oil in it because I can comb throw it but its not greasy.</li>
            <li> I will leave it on more then the 3 hours it suggests.</li>
            <li> When the time comes,  I will gladly order again.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> There are many websites with advice on how to henna your hair (and U tube videos)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Zenia indigo powder.  </li>
            <li> It exceeding my expectations :)</li>
            <li> soaked Henna for more than 12 hrs, applied in my hair and kept it for 5 hrs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this worked like magic, as if i colored my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair and looking at it in the mirror!!I</li>
            <li> Henna has so many benefits</li>
            <li> I love it product.</li>
            <li> so I could get better coverage.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase and will order again.</li>
            <li> if you want the indigo to show up the most, leave the henna on for a lllloongg time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so it will get better coverage</li>
            <li> the longer you leave it the better.</li>
            <li> going to try another seller on amazon for this and hope for better results</li>
            <li> love it....</li>
            <li> but I love the results of my henna</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS IN COMBO WITH THE NUPUR</li>
            <li> Good, I liked the natural look.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found the best chemical free color.</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh, is very fine, so rinsing out is easy.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product for the price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this, and it came super fast which is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best way to color my hair black that I found and I love</li>
            <li> My strain is usually a nice black with incredible luster.</li>
            <li> i have only good things to say about this!:</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly, and I used it in a day.</li>
            <li> So easy to do</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications.</li>
            <li> but this stuff makes your hair strong and shiny</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with the results and specially because I don&#x27;t have to go to the ER anymore.....</li>
            <li> search for pure organic indigo continues!!!</li>
            <li> I left it on for almost 2 hours and got great color</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone who is allergic to ppd in commercial hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fresh and free shipping !</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with going natural!</li>
            <li> I then applied the indigo and I ended up with the most beautiful black hair that was shiny and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past (along with henna - which I&#x27;m very satisfied with btw) and this Indigo does not do it for me at all!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Loved the ease of mixing the powder added coconut oil for extra moisture and work just fine..</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that it makes my hair more manageable, soft, has movement and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> This indigo has no PPD, shipped very quickly and was fresh.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an awesome and safe way to get jet black hair:)</li>
            <li> Well, old school works better and lasts longer!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Indigo, it&#x27;s very finely milled and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I had beautiful dark chocolate brown hair.</li>
            <li> I used this just on its own, and now about 6 months later my hair is still black.&lt;br /&gt;It fades nicely, but do be aware that it will stain the shower if not cleaned up right away.</li>
            <li> This was easy to rinse out with water first.</li>
            <li> The result is a beautiful, non-artificial looking head of raven black hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fresh and effective this indigo powder is.</li>
            <li> Though the gray was still covered, I was hoping that the indigo would not fade after shampooing as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I took equal parts of henna and indigo, and the result was just perfect - beautiful dark brown natural-looking color with 100% grey coverage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with the results of the dark color and color on my greys.</li>
            <li> but I had brown dye on my relaxed ends and bright red greys from my first henna treatment.</li>
            <li> I used the  Indigo as a follow-up to my henna for Jet black hair good product that&#x27;s finely stiffed.</li>
            <li> It made it look more natural and effortless!</li>
            <li> Luckily, since this product is all natural, I was able to use a chemical dye over it with no problems.</li>
            <li> so i think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought indigo before but had success with this one.</li>
            <li> I loved the product so much that I recently purchased the 500 gram size.</li>
            <li> it is worth the time and money....</li>
            <li> I could have lived with the smell if the color would have been right.  </li>
            <li> but I added some more indigo just to make sure the color would still be dark.</li>
            <li> My henna was the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram mixed with warm Goya coconut milk first.</li>
            <li> It IS 100% pure!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Jet Black Hair - well good luck</li>
            <li> This was a very gentle coloring process for my hair.</li>
            <li> My first attempt turned my gray bright orangey-red and it was way too much of a contrast with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I did exactly that...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Many ppl said it was essential to use henna immediately before, but I henna-ed 1 month before and just decided to throw this stuff on anyway to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad because now I have a darker color where as the henna left me with reddish highlights.</li>
            <li> so well, it left more of a residue.  </li>
            <li> I did not follow the instructions given by doing henna first.</li>
            <li> so that was pretty</li>
            <li> co-washed then gave myself and Olive Oil hot oil treatment with a heating bonnet for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This indigo did exactly what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I did the two step process where I did a henna treatment first.  </li>
            <li> Had enough of the Indigo for about three more applications.</li>
            <li> least i haven&#x27;t experienced it yet).</li>
            <li> I used Jamila BAQ first then the indigo</li>
            <li> I mixed this with more henna</li>
            <li> It prob would have done even better if I had not mixed it with henna.</li>
            <li> I am willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> do your research about using indigo first ad</li>
            <li> I was using another vendor for Indigo and then their Indigo Powder went up higher than I wanted to pay.</li>
            <li> But overall ordering from this store for these products is fitting my budget.</li>
            <li> So when i use a cup of henna and a cup of indigo it just brings out the red in my hair more then anything.</li>
            <li> Did the two step process two days ago with Dulhan henna for the first time.</li>
            <li> I use Henna first and then the indigo.  </li>
            <li> I have to now resort to commercial hair color because I don&#x27;t have time to get more indigo.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered more</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get this product to work as described on the package.  </li>
            <li> I use 1-2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (for henna dye release), bottled water (for the henna and indigo); allow 12 hours for the henna to become full strength, mix the indigo, mix the henna and indigo together; the result is  soft, shiny, managable hair that is strong and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Chemical dyes have their own moisture from the ingredients but henna and indigo are dry from the start meaning they need moisture applied to really work.</li>
            <li> so if you love Black hair and want to try a more natural way....</li>
            <li> The stain was good and was able to turn my bleached and dyed purple hair back to my natural dark brown hair color (with this and henna.)</li>
            <li> the whole 100g pack), 1 tbsp of sea salt, almost hot water(helps the salt dissolve), 3 tsp of the Nupur henna, and 1 tsp of Guar Gum Powder(this</li>
            <li> This powder has a earthy smell and my hair did not come out as dark as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> Once I was done washing it out ( you will have to do twice and thoroughly) and blowing my hair dry, my hair was very soft and when i pressed my hair, the results were really nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of like seaweed, spinach, or maybe even a slight weedy scent</li>
            <li> This was cool at first giving me a rich dark luxurious look but after two-three washes the color was gone and in the first two-three days it rubbed off on my clothing and pillow.  </li>
            <li> no PPD, pure indigo powder.</li>
            <li> so I am wondering if this product was even pure or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in the 1st place?</li>
            <li> I loved the color , but it didnt last long really</li>
            <li> not knowing that I was really allergic to that stuff</li>
            <li> mix together when ready to use...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that worked</li>
            <li> After I try this 100g USAWHR Indigo Powder ,&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfy.</li>
            <li> It covers  gray hair really well...  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really like the color</li>
            <li> Then I had it on my hair for 10 whole hours.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely must dye your hair with henna first,the indigo sticks to the henna,</li>
            <li> I am very health conscience, and would not knowingly use anything harmful.  </li>
            <li> i am really upset.</li>
            <li> a natural hair dye gave me,the only thing that i should apply it again after almost 12 days which is ok with me since it is</li>
            <li> but it is better than other brand I have used I will use it till I find another one</li>
            <li> (it was the much raved about Red Raj, I just thought it was too cool toned for my coloring).</li>
            <li> The resulting color was a deep black and offered good gray coverage.  </li>
            <li> i then wrapped my head in a shower cap and let it sit for six full hours, two hours longer than stated on the package because i know indigo essentially works by staining and</li>
            <li> but I found less is more.</li>
            <li> My goal is to cover the gray mostly in the front half of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how black and shiny my hair is afterwards.</li>
            <li> i wanted to darken it more and get a black color without using chemicals.</li>
            <li> It stained really well, and the batch seemed fresh enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and feels really healthy from the total process after deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I definitely would suggest not using and finding a different means to safely color your hair</li>
            <li> This product came in about two days, super fast, went right to work on my sisters hair, mixed this with Jamilah hennah powder for that extra brown look.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I was under the impression that this was a natural product and could cause no damage if it was in fact 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> This really worked on my natural kinky curls that were graying.  </li>
            <li> Long story short - this product works ok but ir may contain PPD.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> but since I have gone all natural for the first time in 14 years of having natural hair, I decided to try indigo to color it instead.</li>
            <li> and I simply apply the following mix of Indigo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indigo Powder mixed with warm water to help release the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The indigo itself was very fresh and well packaged and came sooner than the expected date.  </li>
            <li> My clients love the natural black color that is achieved when using this product.</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying in order for this to properly dispose the right color(black)</li>
            <li> Works well, makes a nice color and the smell is nice,  though it does dry out the hair pretty bad</li>
            <li> Plus hair has a lot less frizz and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> You may add a few drops of essential oil to your Indigo to give it a nice smell.</li>
            <li> pretty much followed the directions to a T and didn&#x27;t even leave it in that long.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Next time I will use henna first, rinse then apply the indigo.</li>
            <li> I mixed it first by itself and did a strand test.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty gross</li>
            <li> you have to follow the instructions to the T. Prior to using this product, hair must be colored first with a henna powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying the henna first gives it something to bond onto and in my opinion helps it last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first i put henna mixed with sage tea and rosemary tea .next</li>
            <li> i generally avoid experimenting too much with my hair</li>
            <li> my hair was still the exact same shade, brown.</li>
            <li> It is just as effective as other more expensive brands I have used.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for cheap and since my hair does turn black I will give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> i followed the instructions for this product super carefully, twice in fact.</li>
            <li> It was a lovely shade of brown and had toned down a lot of red.  </li>
            <li> I was actually ordered more since it didn&#x27;t even turn my hair Jet Black but a darker richer brown.</li>
            <li> pure natural.i hope it would give the same result for whoever uses it.</li>
            <li> I searched for a very long time to find the right mix of natural henna to achieve the results.</li>
            <li> procedure above seems to work fine - it took me about 3-4 tries to work it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currenty 30yrs old...</li>
            <li> I really wish I could have left it on over night</li>
            <li> This is a natural way to darken my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is a natural 3b/3c texture....</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people who are looking for that natural look.</li>
            <li> ( I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair).</li>
            <li> first did henna for about 3 hours to cover my grey, then I dyed my hair with the Indigo</li>
            <li> I used my old heat cap.</li>
            <li> This Indigo Powder has been my go to Indigo powder to use along with my henna of choice in order to naturally color my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wanted a natural way to dye my permed hair to hide the grays.  </li>
            <li> so i thought a natural product would be just the solution for my needs.</li>
            <li> A must for after natural henna which takes out all the grey,but turns your hair orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe after another application the color will completely take.  </li>
            <li> (yeah it&#x27;s a bit old</li>
            <li> Mixed then let sit for 10 min till a blue/deep green glaze formed on the top.</li>
            <li> and it looked so healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> day i put one part henna with 2 parts of indigo mixed with sage and rose mary tea and grey hair was almost dark</li>
            <li> My hair is still not Black, but a brown of some shade.  </li>
            <li> I was actually in the middle of my first time using Henna on my hair</li>
            <li> Also, I just used a little bit of Indigo (just enough to color the hairline &amp; middle) &amp; mixed w/ warm water.  </li>
            <li> So a few days after my last application of henna I mixed up two tablespoons of this Indigo powder with enough warm water to form a yogurt-like consistency.</li>
            <li> then I saturated the rest, my hair is very curly but goes to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I use warm water and Organic Olive Oil (First cold press, extra virgin) to mix it with.</li>
            <li> Though the dye came early, when I dyed my hair, it turned more of a green color, than an Indigo black.</li>
            <li> but I noticed the top was turning black after covering it for another half hour.  </li>
            <li> Mixed up really easy, I used water and a bit of salt, let it sit for 10 minutes then mixed it into henna I had mixed up two days previous.</li>
            <li> and I have had white hair since I was young....</li>
            <li> I used this as a hair dye; when mixed with henna powder it creates a natural brunette dye.</li>
            <li> I will always use this product sense it is all natural, and I&#x27;m allergic to commercial dyes.</li>
            <li> I did this until my whole head was wet to the consistency of aregular chemical dye.</li>
            <li> Helped me achieve a long lasting blue-black pretty color that stands up to washing and various styling products.</li>
            <li> The henna that I ordered was either old or the colorless/yellow product instead of the red henna.</li>
            <li> After talking with a friend of mine who has been doing her hair color with henna for years, I used hot black coffee instead of water, with the indigo.  </li>
            <li> Down side of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wash out the first time, second and maybe third.</li>
            <li> My medium brown hair naturally has a red tint especially in summer months.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using the Lush henna bars, which are super messy, but decided to try the old school method of hennaing and compare.</li>
            <li> Then I started adding hot water from the sink by wetting my hands (sparingly), rubbing them together to get a little soupiness then applied to my head</li>
            <li> However, after my first shampoo following this treatment, the color was no longer jet black, but a brownish-red as the undertones from the henna began to blend in.  </li>
            <li> The grey hairs were completely covered.  </li>
            <li> I mixed 1 part Jamila BAQ henna with 2 parts Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder for a dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li> I reached a dark color leaning towards a rich black.</li>
            <li> I use 1/2 cup of henna and a whole cup or packet of the indigo for a deep, dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have used henna several times throughout the 14 years of being natural but I have never used Indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to cover my grey for a party this weekend</li>
            <li> For first time indigo buyers out there, know that indigo mixes up green and changes to blue.</li>
            <li> Once I had applied it all over, I quickly mixed up a small batch of the product making it a little more soupy than the one I had already applied.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t apply Indigo Powder  to my whole hair,, just brush a little indigo powder in the place</li>
            <li> Turns my hair super dark every time without the harsh chemicals found in commercial dyes.</li>
            <li> the first time i mixed half the packet (since i have short hair only around half was needed according to the package instructions) with Nupur Mehendi.</li>
            <li> after a week or two my hair looks brown almost from the henna I applied prior to the Indigo.this product doesnt last as long as my staple indogo powder.</li>
            <li> just as background, i have brown normal hair that is a few inches above my shoulders.</li>
            <li> this is first time used henna ,,,, it is make my hair black but not my hair only my body too and after make a shawer when put my hand on hair take the black color  </li>
            <li> -mix a small about of Indigo when you are ready to use it..</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark hair but the henna stained it to a burgundy which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully as the second step in covering stubborn grey hairs.  </li>
            <li> long it will last in my hair</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s just say it was a long day devoted only to hair care from morning to night time.</li>
            <li> result was a very natural color (blackish brown) and there were a few white hairs, but that was probably because the henna wasn&#x27;t left on for very long</li>
            <li> Now all of my hair is black and most greys are black but some are red but not nearly as bright red as before.</li>
            <li> My natural hair colour is a 1B (off black); I&#x27;ve been using henna so</li>
            <li> only drawback was it did not completely cover the red that the henna had left on my grays, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad the different color contrast was ok.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole package of Indigo and half a package of Godrej Nupur Henna and half a package of neutral henna (does not color hair).</li>
            <li> It was a little green at first even after letting it sit for about an hour</li>
            <li> /&gt;machines.&lt;br /&gt;Usually once I use a product with PPD on my hair, the effects will not show the next morning but usually it takes about 48 hours and the itching starts at the hairlines especially around the ears and a general feeing of itchiness all over&lt;br /&gt;the body.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that I have a sensitive spot (a stress spot) in the middle of my head</li>
            <li> My hair is about 35% grey</li>
            <li> If you have ever used henna on grey hair, you know that it will make the grey hair orange.  </li>
            <li> order one bag,,it may use for a long period.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t long before my hair turned a silvery-white.</li>
            <li> after I let the Nupur henna sit on the counter overnight for over 12 hours i mixed the indigo in the morning with it and let it sit for around 20 minutes and then carefully applied it evenly all over my hair.</li>
            <li> of course there&#x27;s a red tint to it now; I was hoping to get rid of this \\&quot;red tint\\&quot;, as I prefer jet black hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i used these to cover my graying black american coarse hair....</li>
            <li> I only used half if the package because my hair is short.</li>
            <li> I have followed the instructions very carefully, it does not give the blue tinge</li>
            <li> My hair was dry when I put it in.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all, and I am prone to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with boiled water separately from henna for dark brown shade and grey roots coverage.</li>
            <li> and it definitely toned my grey down ALOT.</li>
            <li> I like the dark black color of the henna, naturally.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only explanation i can think of, i got a product that was not fresh and lost its potency, if something like this happens with indigo.</li>
            <li> Next time I will mix it with the henna because I wasn&#x27;t aiming for it to be this dark.</li>
            <li> Black in the winter and blonde in the summer.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown; a few years ago I started going gray</li>
            <li> I did some research and discovered depending on how the henna and indigo are mixed you can achieve a range of colors from medium brown to black.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that the product took about a week and a half to get to me, but at this price and for the quality, I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> No change in hair color and now my roots are brights red while the rest of my hair is black.</li>
            <li> I felt like it coated my hair in like a black crumbly material, which did not actually dye my hair and flaked off.</li>
            <li> It came out very dark, and my greys (I&#x27;m 20% grey)  went from flame red to dark brown.</li>
            <li> Apply the Henna to mildly wet hair&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair was wet but not dripping.</li>
            <li> Not really staining.</li>
            <li> Coverage was not as expected.</li>
            <li> I spent 4 hours to try the product</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and there was absolutely no change to my auburn colored hair.</li>
            <li> After leaving it in for 5 hours, it never turned blue, it stayed green.</li>
            <li> will get you the dark brown to blackish color depending on how long you leave it on.</li>
            <li> I have been grey since I was 17 and always used chemical dyes in black or platinum blond.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover grey that I had previously henna-ed</li>
            <li> but it did tame the red from the henna.</li>
            <li> #34;What if I hate the results!?&amp;#34; I knew that indigo could be added to henna to create a warm chocolate brown color (or even black depending on the ratio of Henna to Indigo)</li>
            <li> Its really not rocket science!</li>
            <li> other downside is it stains your tub(mercilessly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other indigo powders that did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> add to the other mixes..to help tone down colors</li>
            <li> Even the grays that the henna did not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; turned dark with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My greys are gone and my hair is really dark.</li>
            <li> My gray hair is shiny and semi-permnant color (dark brown)</li>
            <li> I purchased this and used it with henna to get that &#x27;dark auburn&#x27; effect instead of using chemical dyes...</li>
            <li> when i ordered this product i was not sure it would cover my grey hair</li>
            <li> i have considered that maybe the product is expired or not fresh</li>
            <li> i can see it has worked for some people so beware of getting a not fresh product from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three days since and the greys are now dark dark brown, with the rest of my hair almost jet black.</li>
            <li> So I added the Nupur thinking it would cut down the greenish look.</li>
            <li> Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen.</li>
            <li> turned to dull brown after a few washes and the gray turned yellow.</li>
            <li> then I found online that if you use Henna and this product together you get really black hair</li>
            <li> and a half of Nupur Mehendi to about 6 oz.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with black soap anyway</li>
            <li> it gave me JET BLACK HAIR that was previously auburn.</li>
            <li> Our hair look naturally black now.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally black</li>
            <li> and I colored my hair black with it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone trying to dye their hair black.  </li>
            <li> I was under the impression I would have to dye my hair less times than when I used chemical rinses.  </li>
            <li> I would rather use the chemical rinses because it takes less time to apply and get results.  </li>
            <li> Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram 3 PACK) and Zenia Indigo from this seller for less than $15.</li>
            <li> so ended up with ashy black hair.</li>
            <li> The henna powder i purchased from a different vendor turned out the results as expected, but this indigo powder did a poor job.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use Bigen dye to get my hair black.</li>
            <li> so I could make my hair Jet Black</li>
            <li> I had read previous reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Be prepared for a hard and long scrubbing even with bleach or baking soda.</li>
            <li> So think long and hard.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone attempting to achieve shiny black hair without harsh chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> but I used it to get the oil out a little from the H.O.T.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American and my hair is a little course and using this product also served as some type of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just use one  tp powder mix with water and little salt.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> This indigo did the trick and my hair is now really dark!</li>
            <li> I get very dark brown with an auburn highlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,but it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> i must admit, but it dyed every strand of my hair black!</li>
            <li> My hair came out so black !</li>
            <li> Very black.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait for the indigo to turn black or blue, if it does then it uselessly has released its color before</li>
            <li> I then added 1/2 cup of a thick conditioner to the mixture and applied that all over my hair, leaving it to sit for half an hour.</li>
            <li> Not sure though if it has helped darken my color in anyway.</li>
            <li> apply my henna gloss as usual which I mix with tea, conditioner, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I tend to reapply as needed usually every two to three months depending on how often I was my hair</li>
            <li> if youre looking for an alternative way of coloring your hair instead of harsh chemicals, try this out!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this indigo since the indigo I usually purchase has been out of stock for some time.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the second product is conveniently expensive too.</li>
            <li> The bad news is my hair wasn&#x27;t anywhere near black.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet, but the packaging looks not so reliable, two packs printed behind the writing than the poor, as well as barcode printing industry is not very clear</li>
            <li> It is hard to do by myself</li>
            <li> and YES I left this Indigo on for at least 3 - 4 hours!!!</li>
            <li> It comes out black,,at least not so red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I recommend oiling your hair at least three times weekly overnight.</li>
            <li> But in all fairness, just about every single product on the market makes me itch like crazy, which is why I tend to stay away from leave-in anything.</li>
            <li> I also think I am allergic to the Indigo or this brand (not sure) because I itch like crazy for a few days after I use</li>
            <li> Not the artificial black that you get with chemical dyes.  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s color is off black with a brownish/reddish tints which to me makes my hair look dirty.  </li>
            <li> people complain that it does not work - well, the secret is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I was too tired to get fancy with it).</li>
            <li> how could two long treatments fail unless the product is bad?</li>
            <li> Two stars because the product&#x27;s application wasn&#x27;t messy and washing/rinsing it out wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> For all of the ladies who said this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, you must have applied it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the straining at all.</li>
            <li> I might have done something wrong, but I know i followed the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> This product truly has very poor dye release.  </li>
            <li> smells terrible and turned my hair a strangest color...not the black that I wanted.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff made it itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Use an oil that does not contain artificial dyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read of some versions being dangerous to your body.  </li>
            <li> The product smelled bad, not to use and it was not working.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t know maybe it was a bad batch</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> hate it is</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of the chemical hair dye on my scalp,it feels like its burning.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I hate being cheated into buying something else just so that the product I bought can work.</li>
            <li> and i really hated the smell it smelled like grass and acidic plums or something.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> so it was an awful orange.</li>
            <li> ,that is probably the worst thing you can do for your hair.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> This product was terrible!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past (along with henna - which I&#x27;m very satisfied with btw) and this Indigo does not do it for me at all!! I have one more pack to use and then that&#x27;s it .... I will not be re-ordering. My natural hair colour is a 1B (off black); I&#x27;ve been using henna so of course there&#x27;s a red tint to it now; I was hoping to get rid of this \\&quot;red tint\\&quot;, as I prefer jet black hair. So not the case - my hair still has that tint.... and YES I left this Indigo on for at least 3 - 4 hours!!! If you&#x27;re looking for Jet Black Hair - well good luck but I couldn&#x27;t seem to achieve it here. Two stars because the product&#x27;s application wasn&#x27;t messy and washing/rinsing it out wasn&#x27;t bad. Smell isn&#x27;t crazy-bad either.</li>
            <li> Long story short - this product works ok but ir may contain PPD.&lt;br /&gt;Many people complain that it does not work - well, the secret is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak the Henna for more than 2-3 hours&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the Henna to mildly wet hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait for 3-4 hours and wash it off&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait for an hour or so&lt;br /&gt;5. Soak the Indigo in water and wait for about 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;6. Don&#x27;t wait for the indigo to turn black or blue, if it does then it uselessly has released its color before&lt;br /&gt;you applied it to your hair.  It MUST release its color in your hair onto the Henna, not in the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply the indigo&lt;br /&gt;8. Wait for 3-4 hours and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This procedure above seems to work fine - it took me about 3-4 tries to work it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to my suspicion about PPD in this product, this is the second time I have used this product after purchase and I suspect it has PPD maybe in minute quantities.&lt;br /&gt;How do I know?  Well, my scalp and body over the years have become PPD detection&lt;br /&gt;machines.&lt;br /&gt;Usually once I use a product with PPD on my hair, the effects will not show the next morning but usually it takes about 48 hours and the itching starts at the hairlines especially around the ears and a general feeing of itchiness all over&lt;br /&gt;the body.  I had this reaction on tuesday after I applied the indigo on sunday evening around 3:00 PM and washed it off at 7:30 PM.  So, be warned.&lt;br /&gt;My search for pure organic indigo continues!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product. I added it to my henna.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product. I cannot believe that it makes my hair more manageable, soft, has movement and looks healthy. Zenia indigo.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try darken my henna. It smells very fresh, is very fine, so rinsing out is easy. Not sure though if it has helped darken my color in anyway. I have followed the instructions very carefully, it does not give the blue tinge it is supposed to when you soak it for 15 min prior to using it. Have used it twice and there is just enough to try for the third time and if I see any improvement, I&#x27;ll post it. Jury is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,but it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currenty 30yrs old... and I have had white hair since I was young.... I was dying my hair with regular hair dye until I ended up in the ER twice not knowing that I was really allergic to that stuff.... then I found online that if you use Henna and this product together you get really black hair just how I love it.... I did exactly that... and I&#x27;m in love with the results and specially because I don&#x27;t have to go to the ER anymore..... so if you love Black hair and want to try a more natural way.... go with this.... it&#x27;s awesome... :-)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t of been better! Exactly what I was expecting. For first time indigo buyers out there, know that indigo mixes up green and changes to blue.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product. I received my order very quickly, and I used it in a day. I was surprised how fresh and effective this indigo powder is. I mixed it with boiled water separately from henna for dark brown shade and grey roots coverage. I let it sit for 10 minutes, then added it to my henna mix (which was sitting for 4 hours). I took equal parts of henna and indigo, and the result was just perfect - beautiful dark brown natural-looking color with 100% grey coverage. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. Well-packaged. I used this as a hair dye; when mixed with henna powder it creates a natural brunette dye. My hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> The product worked great. I will always use this product sense it is all natural, and I&#x27;m allergic to commercial dyes.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to cover the gray..-mix a small about of Indigo when you are ready to use it..Do not let it sit over night--add to the other mixes..to help tone down colors&lt;br /&gt;i used these to cover my graying black american coarse hair....I get a reddish&lt;br /&gt;-mix part Henna -with apple cider vin-part Cassia with apple cider---- let them both sit over night&lt;br /&gt;then mix together when ready to use...let stay on hair for 3- hours... wash/rinse</li>
            <li> I used this to darken my graying roots and edges along with my [[ASIN:B001T7APMG Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram]] application. The results were perfect! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My mom and wife are dying their hair with Hannah these days and they use this indigo powder to control the darkness. It is very effective and good product.</li>
            <li> Mixed up really easy, I used water and a bit of salt, let it sit for 10 minutes then mixed it into henna I had mixed up two days previous. I had my husband help me apply this to my roots then I saturated the rest, my hair is very curly but goes to the middle of my back. I used the whole package of Indigo and half a package of Godrej Nupur Henna and half a package of neutral henna (does not color hair). I added ACV to the henna mixture and water. I always use Dabur Vatika Coconut hair oil before color, making sure to get my hair good a saturated with it, then I apply the henna/indigo mixture. I left it on for almost 2 hours and got great color but I still wanted darker. Next time I will use henna first, rinse then apply the indigo.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, maybe it is what type of hair that you have. It did not color my hair at all, I will not buy it again, but The Henna Guys works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I am a African American.</li>
            <li> This really worked on my natural kinky curls that were graying.  Many ppl said it was essential to use henna immediately before, but I henna-ed 1 month before and just decided to throw this stuff on anyway to see if it worked. Turns out it worked amazingly well. Even the grays that the henna did not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; turned dark with this stuff. I&#x27;m glad because now I have a darker color where as the henna left me with reddish highlights. The only negative is that I have a sensitive spot (a stress spot) in the middle of my head and this stuff made it itch like crazy. But in all fairness, just about every single product on the market makes me itch like crazy, which is why I tend to stay away from leave-in anything. The henna didn&#x27;t make me itch, but I guess since this stuff sticks so well, it left more of a residue.  I&#x27;m on week 2 and the color is holding. Next time, though, I will try the 2 step process: 1. Henna (over night) and 2. Indigo (next day). Also, I just used a little bit of Indigo (just enough to color the hairline &amp; middle) &amp; mixed w/ warm water.  I heard it&#x27;s best to store the unused in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I loved the color , but it didnt last long really and i really hated the smell it smelled like grass and acidic plums or something. The color was reallly nice I just with it stayed</li>
            <li> For all of the ladies who said this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, you must have applied it wrong. Its really not rocket science! I did not follow the instructions given by doing henna first. I simply added a tbsp. and a half of Nupur Mehendi to about 6 oz. of Indigo powder and I got amazing results. My hair is about 35% grey and I&#x27;m only 36. I have been grey since I was 17 and always used chemical dyes in black or platinum blond. Black in the winter and blonde in the summer. I love to color my hair but since I have gone all natural for the first time in 14 years of having natural hair, I decided to try indigo to color it instead. Now keep in mind I have used henna several times throughout the 14 years of being natural but I have never used Indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to cover my grey for a party this weekend so I ordered this Friday 8/3/13 and I got it on 8/6/13 so that was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;So I mixed it first by itself and did a strand test. It was a little green at first even after letting it sit for about an hour but I noticed the top was turning black after covering it for another half hour.  So I added the Nupur thinking it would cut down the greenish look. I really don&#x27;t think that worked but I added some more indigo just to make sure the color would still be dark. I read some reviews that said Nupur makes it red so I didn&#x27;t want any red hair. Also, I didn&#x27;t use a lot of Nupur incase this process didn&#x27;t turn out right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So getting to applying the product. My hair was dry when I put it in. From roots to tips, I applied it while trying to message it in as much as possible before moving around my head. Once I had applied it all over, I quickly mixed up a small batch of the product making it a little more soupy than the one I had already applied. Then I started adding hot water from the sink by wetting my hands (sparingly), rubbing them together to get a little soupiness then applied to my head I did this until my whole head was wet to the consistency of aregular chemical dye. Then I applied my soupy mixture just for added security incase I missed some spots. Chemical dyes have their own moisture from the ingredients but henna and indigo are dry from the start meaning they need moisture applied to really work. My hair was wet but not dripping. I had no dripping at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a plastic cap on, a bonnet and wrapped a head band around my head to keep the heat in. My results were amazing after leaving it on for about 4 hours. My greys are gone and my hair is really dark. I really wish I could have left it on over night but I&#x27;m working out in the morning and this would be a hassle for me at 4:45 in the am. So I washed it out, co-washed then gave myself and Olive Oil hot oil treatment with a heating bonnet for 30 minutes. I wash my hair with black soap anyway but I used it to get the oil out a little from the H.O.T. For the most part, my hair has oil in it because I can comb throw it but its not greasy. For those who have not figured it out yet, I&#x27;m African American with 3c hair. LOL! I hope this helps someone. I read about 50 reviews before I purchase anything, just to get an array of different opinions. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Though the dye came early, when I dyed my hair, it turned more of a green color, than an Indigo black. And the color washed out within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This indigo did exactly what it was supposed to. The smell is pretty gross i must admit, but it dyed every strand of my hair black! It looks awesome! The smell is kind of like seaweed, spinach, or maybe even a slight weedy scent but it works great! I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> This powder has a earthy smell and my hair did not come out as dark as i would have liked. I will try again next time I will leave it on more then the 3 hours it suggests. This is a natural way to darken my hair so i think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This was the best indigo I have ever used!!!  I did the two step process where I did a henna treatment first.  If you have ever used henna on grey hair, you know that it will make the grey hair orange.  Well, it did.  I then applied the indigo and I ended up with the most beautiful black hair that was shiny and full of body.  Not the artificial black that you get with chemical dyes.  The color had depth.  The grey hairs were completely covered.  The indigo itself was very fresh and well packaged and came sooner than the expected date.  I was more than satisfied with the seller and very happy with the product.  When the time comes,  I will gladly order again.</li>
            <li> It worked well with my henna. I will be happy to use it again! I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist who is allergic to hair dye. I searched for a very long time to find the right mix of natural henna to achieve the results. My clients love the natural black color that is achieved when using this product. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but does the job for me. It is just as effective as other more expensive brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Covers my gray!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and it came super fast which is great. My hair is a natural 3b/3c texture.... I bought it to mix it in with my henna to get the color I wanted for my hair.... It stained really well, and the batch seemed fresh enough. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, I will be ordering it again when it&#x27;s coloring time again!</li>
            <li> This product came in about two days, super fast, went right to work on my sisters hair, mixed this with Jamilah hennah powder for that extra brown look. Had enough of the Indigo for about three more applications.</li>
            <li> Good, I liked the natural look. It has no chemicals added. I recommend this product for people who are looking for that natural look.</li>
            <li> after a week or two my hair looks brown almost from the henna I applied prior to the Indigo.this product doesnt last as long as my staple indogo powder. It was purchased for cheap and since my hair does turn black I will give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> it gave me JET BLACK HAIR that was previously auburn. I want to start off by saying in order for this to properly dispose the right color(black) you have to follow the instructions to the T. Prior to using this product, hair must be colored first with a henna powder. Down side of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wash out the first time, second and maybe third. But it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or damage to your hair(at least i haven&#x27;t experienced it yet). other downside is it stains your tub(mercilessly). Be prepared for a hard and long scrubbing even with bleach or baking soda. Overall it&#x27;s an awesome and safe way to get jet black hair:)</li>
            <li> I used this indigo as a 2-step process following my henna application.  After applying the indigo per package instructions and letting it set, I rinsed my hair with water only.  The resulting color was a deep black and offered good gray coverage.  The color continued to deepen the next day.  However, after my first shampoo following this treatment, the color was no longer jet black, but a brownish-red as the undertones from the henna began to blend in.  Though the gray was still covered, I was hoping that the indigo would not fade after shampooing as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li> This was a very gentle coloring process for my hair. I&#x27;m an African-American and my hair is a little course and using this product also served as some type of conditioner. Once I was done washing it out ( you will have to do twice and thoroughly) and blowing my hair dry, my hair was very soft and when i pressed my hair, the results were really nice.</li>
            <li> this is first time used henna ,,,, it is make my hair black but not my hair only my body too and after make a shawer when put my hand on hair take the black color  i think i dont by this is henna again this is same CAST SHOES</li>
            <li> I like the dark black color of the henna, naturally.  I recommend this product to those that knows&lt;br /&gt;how to apply the henna application properly.</li>
            <li> Good gray coverage. Use after henna application for best results&lt;br /&gt;Go to henna page.com for advice on henna and indigo</li>
            <li> Worked really well will order again!!!!!! Used after I henna,, covered the gray for my mom. Awesome! So easy to do</li>
            <li> I have not yet, but the packaging looks not so reliable, two packs printed behind the writing than the poor, as well as barcode printing industry is not very clear</li>
            <li> it worked, lasted 2 months.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Mixes well with henna. I sometimes add it to henna to make my gray strands a darker color. Would definitely would recommend this brand of indigo.</li>
            <li> I used the  Indigo as a follow-up to my henna for Jet black hair good product that&#x27;s finely stiffed. Excellent for Afro-American 4c hair</li>
            <li> Finally I have found the best chemical free color.My husband and I have both used this indigo powder and got excellent results.Our hair look naturally black now.</li>
            <li> After I try this 100g USAWHR Indigo Powder ,&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfy. I just use one  tp powder mix with water and little salt.&lt;br /&gt;Then apply it to my hair (after I dye with Henna Powder)&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t apply Indigo Powder  to my whole hair,, just brush a little indigo powder in the place&lt;br /&gt;you hate it is still looks too red. It comes out black,,at least not so red.&lt;br /&gt;So by  this way,,you don&#x27;t worry about your hair become blue color.&lt;br /&gt;I order one bag,,it may use for a long period.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown; a few years ago I started going gray and it wasn&#x27;t long before my hair turned a silvery-white. My gray hair is shiny and semi-permnant color (dark brown) turned to dull brown after a few washes and the gray turned yellow. A co-worker told me about dyeing my hair with henna. My first attempt turned my gray bright orangey-red and it was way too much of a contrast with my dark brown hair. I did some research and discovered depending on how the henna and indigo are mixed you can achieve a range of colors from medium brown to black. I mixed 1 part Jamila BAQ henna with 2 parts Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder for a dark reddish brown. There are many websites with advice on how to henna your hair (and U tube videos) but I found less is more. I use 1-2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (for henna dye release), bottled water (for the henna and indigo); allow 12 hours for the henna to become full strength, mix the indigo, mix the henna and indigo together; the result is  soft, shiny, managable hair that is strong and looks natural. I will never use chemical dyes again!!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. It dyes well though.</li>
            <li> The indigo did an excellent job coloring my naturally 4 c hair and my relaxed hair ( I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair). I only used half if the package because my hair is short. I used Jamila BAQ first then the indigo and I&#x27;m happy with the results of the dark color and color on my greys. This indigo has no PPD, shipped very quickly and was fresh. My hair is naturally black but I had brown dye on my relaxed ends and bright red greys from my first henna treatment. Now all of my hair is black and most greys are black but some are red but not nearly as bright red as before.</li>
            <li> It covers  gray hair really well...  Add warm water, 2 tsp of olive oil, and  pinch salt....  If u add organic coconut oil it will turn your hair purple.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Zenia indigo powder.  I use it faithfully as the second step in covering stubborn grey hairs.  I would recommend this product to anyone attempting to achieve shiny black hair without harsh chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> Very black. It exceeding my expectations :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover grey that I had previously henna-ed so it was an awful orange. I mixed this with more henna and it definitely toned my grey down ALOT. It prob would have done even better if I had not mixed it with henna. Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the package, leaving it in my hair for 3 hours and I received a reddish brown color. I should have kept it in overnight, I don&#x27;t really like the color but it did tame the red from the henna. I am willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> I am using this along with henna to darken the color. I add to the henna mixture just before applying and it works great. My hair is medium/dark brown, and I use about 2/3 henna, and 1/3 indigo. This keeps my hair at a medium/dark brown with a tint of red.</li>
            <li> .... well the best that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried other indigo powders that did not work as well as this one. I&#x27;m using this one again.</li>
            <li> I havent henna&#x27;d in a while but this stuff makes your hair strong and shiny and I colored my hair black with it and it looked so healthy and thick. Its a keeper.</li>
            <li> Works well, makes a nice color and the smell is nice,  though it does dry out the hair pretty bad</li>
            <li> Damaged manufacturer packing. Not really staining.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly. I used it along with impressions henna.&lt;br /&gt;I have asian-indian hair and lot of grays.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked Henna for more than 12 hrs, applied in my hair and kept it for 5 hrs. After washing my hair i applied indigo mix.&lt;br /&gt;this worked like magic, as if i colored my hair. I love the results. Finally i can stop using hair color altogether. Plus hair has a lot less frizz and easy to manage. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;How long it will last in my hair is yet to be seen, will update the review. As of now loving it!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product...value for money...presentation and packaging was exceptional...will re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The results from using the product was exceptional, will continue using.</li>
            <li> I used regular henna on my hair before using the Indigo so it was red.  After talking with a friend of mine who has been doing her hair color with henna for years, I used hot black coffee instead of water, with the indigo.  I put it all over my hair and covered it with a plastic cap thing.  Then I had it on my hair for 10 whole hours.  The good news is that my hair had a lovely aromoa of coffee.  The bad news is my hair wasn&#x27;t anywhere near black.  It was a lovely shade of brown and had toned down a lot of red.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone trying to dye their hair black.  I had to buy a chemical dye.  Luckily, since this product is all natural, I was able to use a chemical dye over it with no problems.</li>
            <li> Quality not stable. Some are very good but some are not so  good.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This was my first time using Indigo and my color is now a beautiful glossy black!&lt;br /&gt;I first did henna for about 3 hours to cover my grey, then I dyed my hair with the Indigo the following&lt;br /&gt;weekend. I wrapped my hair with saran wrap and  I left it on for two hours, for 30 minutes I used my old heat cap. It came out so beautiful I have never had the same result with chemical dyes. I hate the feeling of the chemical hair dye on my scalp,it feels like its burning.&lt;br /&gt; You absolutely must dye your hair with henna first,the indigo sticks to the henna,if not you will end up with zero coverage. You may add a few drops of essential oil to your Indigo to give it a nice smell. Also I recommend oiling your hair at least three times weekly overnight. Use an oil that does not contain artificial dyes. You can buy almond or cocconut oil and use that as well.&lt;br /&gt; It does take alot longer than chemical hair dyes but it is well worth the effort.After using Henna/Indigo process I am never going back to chemical hair dyes!!If you have problems with hair loss and dye your hair with chemicals,that is probably the worst thing you can do for your hair. The chemical hair dyes damage your hair follicles and will result in hair loss after time. My hair is so soft and shiny!! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair and looking at it in the mirror!!I really liked this product do your research about using indigo first ad then do it and you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do. No salon can fix this mistake.</li>
            <li> I have used this indigo twice (with Jamila Henna, which is great).  My hair is still not Black, but a brown of some shade.  Also, I thought this stuff was supposed to be permanent - it&#x27;s not.  I was under the impression I would have to dye my hair less times than when I used chemical rinses.  I would rather use the chemical rinses because it takes less time to apply and get results.  I also think I am allergic to the Indigo or this brand (not sure) because I itch like crazy for a few days after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to look for another brand to see if the results are different.</li>
            <li> I love it product. My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications. It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought indigo before but had success with this one. The stain was good and was able to turn my bleached and dyed purple hair back to my natural dark brown hair color (with this and henna.)</li>
            <li> Turns my hair super dark every time without the harsh chemicals found in commercial dyes. I am very pleased with going natural! I use warm water and Organic Olive Oil (First cold press, extra virgin) to mix it with. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I used this in the 2 step process. My henna was the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram mixed with warm Goya coconut milk first. Then I followed up with Zenia Indigo Powder(almost the whole 100g pack), 1 tbsp of sea salt, almost hot water(helps the salt dissolve), 3 tsp of the Nupur henna, and 1 tsp of Guar Gum Powder(this helps make the mixture smoother). Mixed then let sit for 10 min till a blue/deep green glaze formed on the top. Applied to my hair(natural African American hair) and let darken for up to 1 hr 30 min. This was easy to rinse out with water first. Then I did another rinse with moisturizing conditioner. I reached a dark color leaning towards a rich black. It did get darker the next day and I was happy with the color and coverage. My goal is to cover the gray mostly in the front half of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied this at home and recently talked my hairdresser into applying the 2 step so I could get better coverage. It is hard to do by myself and I found I was not getting the back of my head well. I find that in 3 weeks it fades to a brownish red. I do the 2 step to the roots by week 6 because I don&#x27;t like seeing my gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived in a good timeframe from this vendor. I was using another vendor for Indigo and then their Indigo Powder went up higher than I wanted to pay. After searching I found my Henna(Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram 3 PACK) and Zenia Indigo from this seller for less than $15. It seems the price may vary if the stock is low. But overall ordering from this store for these products is fitting my budget. I am pleased with this purchase and will order again.</li>
            <li> This Indigo Powder has been my go to Indigo powder to use along with my henna of choice in order to naturally color my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great coverage for gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years and totally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply my henna gloss as usual which I mix with tea, conditioner, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse out my henna I do not shampoo and I simply apply the following mix of Indigo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indigo Powder mixed with warm water to help release the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the henna first gives it something to bond onto and in my opinion helps it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to reapply as needed usually every two to three months depending on how often I was my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please understand that you must cover up the area in which you are using this product as it stains but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best way to color my hair black that I found and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have found my review helpful.</li>
            <li> my gray start showing in 3weeks .....but it is better than other brand I have used I will use it till I find another one</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Helped me achieve a long lasting blue-black pretty color that stands up to washing and various styling products.</li>
            <li> Coverage was not as expected.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of anxiety on my part about trying this, although it had been recommended to me.  I&#x27;d read of some versions being dangerous to your body.  I am very health conscience, and would not knowingly use anything harmful.  This was just what it said it would be.  Although, you must take precautions to protect your floors, etc&#x27;, when applying it to the hair, for instance, with henna.  The compound is such, that there may be droppings or splatters onto your surrounding areas.  There were no problems when I followed this advice.</li>
            <li> Once i figured out my indigo to henna mixture, i got the color i wanted. I use 1/2 cup of henna and a whole cup or packet of the indigo for a deep, dark brown. My medium brown hair naturally has a red tint especially in summer months. So when i use a cup of henna and a cup of indigo it just brings out the red in my hair more then anything.</li>
            <li> This was my sample. I loved the product so much that I recently purchased the 500 gram size. I use it with henna as a hair dye for people with a sensitivity to commerial hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom! She followed the instructions on the back of the pack (except added curd and cinnamon to the mixture) . But she left the henna on only for two hours. I think the indigo dyes the coating the henna puts on your hair, so if you want the indigo to show up the most, leave the henna on for a lllloongg time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this indigo did NOT react with my mom&#x27;s chemically dyed hair! It IS 100% pure! No metallic salts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a very natural color (blackish brown) and there were a few white hairs, but that was probably because the henna wasn&#x27;t left on for very long and she missed some spots on the side of her head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like it with some white! It made it look more natural and effortless! Next time she will leave the henna on longer and then indigo so it will get better coverage though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this! Indigo is a great healthier alternative to those damaging chemical packed dyes!</li>
            <li> This was a really great crop. Did the two step process two days ago with Dulhan henna for the first time. I&#x27;m for sure going to keep doing the process! My hair is shiny and feels really healthy from the total process after deep conditioning. I naturally have dark hair but the henna stained it to a burgundy which I don&#x27;t like. This indigo did the trick and my hair is now really dark! Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this to dye my hair all the time. It is very good quality and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I wanted a natural way to dye my permed hair to hide the grays.  I&#x27;ve used this product twice in the last 6 months.  I use Henna first and then the indigo.  I love how black and shiny my hair is afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and used it with henna to get that &#x27;dark auburn&#x27; effect instead of using chemical dyes...i have only good things to say about this!: the color is extremely nice, great coverage and everything, no side effects, great price too! if youre looking for an alternative way of coloring your hair instead of harsh chemicals, try this out!</li>
            <li> when i ordered this product i was not sure it would cover my grey hair but i was amazed after using it. first i put henna mixed with sage tea and rosemary tea .next day i put one part henna with 2 parts of indigo mixed with sage and rose mary tea and grey hair was almost dark brown.this product gave me almost the same result a natural hair dye gave me,the only thing that i should apply it again after almost 12 days which is ok with me since it is&lt;br /&gt;a pure natural.i hope it would give the same result for whoever uses it.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s color is off black with a brownish/reddish tints which to me makes my hair look dirty.  This was cool at first giving me a rich dark luxurious look but after two-three washes the color was gone and in the first two-three days it rubbed off on my clothing and pillow.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> just as background, i have brown normal hair that is a few inches above my shoulders. i wanted to darken it more and get a black color without using chemicals. the last thing i had done anything with my hair, as in red highlights, was ten years ago. i generally avoid experimenting too much with my hair so i thought a natural product would be just the solution for my needs. i followed the instructions for this product super carefully, twice in fact. the first time i mixed half the packet (since i have short hair only around half was needed according to the package instructions) with Nupur Mehendi. after I let the Nupur henna sit on the counter overnight for over 12 hours i mixed the indigo in the morning with it and let it sit for around 20 minutes and then carefully applied it evenly all over my hair. i then wrapped my head in a shower cap and let it sit for six full hours, two hours longer than stated on the package because i know indigo essentially works by staining and the longer you leave it the better. i washed my hair after six hours but just with conditioner so it gets the chance to oxidize and then almost 24 hours later i shampooed and conditioned again. my hair was still the exact same shade, brown. i figured maybe i should use the indigo separately so a week later i repeated the process but did both the henna and the indigo separately, letting each sit for 6 hours. let&#x27;s just say it was a long day devoted only to hair care from morning to night time. i again just conditioned and waited a day to shampoo and condition and well my hair is just still just brown. i swear not a shade darker. the henna made it coppery throughout but the indigo didnt leave any effect. i am really upset. how could this happen? how could two long treatments fail unless the product is bad? i have considered that maybe the product is expired or not fresh so i tried to look for an expiration date but no luck, none on the package i can see. the henna product has an expiration date so ithink the indigo products should have one too. that&#x27;s the only explanation i can think of, i got a product that was not fresh and lost its potency, if something like this happens with indigo. i can see it has worked for some people so beware of getting a not fresh product from this seller. going to try another seller on amazon for this and hope for better results</li>
            <li> I have been doing the 2-step process for years. I decided to try this indigo since the indigo I usually purchase has been out of stock for some time. I was not impressed with the straining at all. My strain is usually a nice black with incredible luster. It was not the case with this indigo. It did not strain my hair very good...so ended up with ashy black hair.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.  This product was terrible!  I definitely would not recommend for anyone.  smells terrible and turned my hair a strangest color...not the black that I wanted.  I could have lived with the smell if the color would have been right.  I definitely would suggest not using and finding a different means to safely color your hair</li>
            <li> I will order this product again it is worth the time and money.... love it.... you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the review i saw  on the amazon. I spent 4 hours to try the product and it was disaster. The product smelled bad, not to use and it was not working. After 4 hours of spending my time to color my hair, my hair still is the same before coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product is NOT working all and the seller refused to refund the money.</li>
            <li> This indigo is good quality and as promised. No ammonia no PPD, pure indigo powder. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I used this just on its own, and now about 6 months later my hair is still black.&lt;br /&gt;It fades nicely, but do be aware that it will stain the shower if not cleaned up right away. Oops...</li>
            <li> This product truly has very poor dye release.  I followed the proper instructions to prepare my henna and this indigo powder.  The henna powder i purchased from a different vendor turned out the results as expected, but this indigo powder did a poor job.  Minimum dye release.  Truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after lots of research on where to find the best Indigo powder. I was actually in the middle of my first time using Henna on my hair and I was suddenly struck with the thought of, &amp;#34;What if I hate the results!?&amp;#34; I knew that indigo could be added to henna to create a warm chocolate brown color (or even black depending on the ratio of Henna to Indigo) so I purchased this immediately in the midst of my panic, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received this Indigo a week later but I love the results of my henna so I didn&#x27;t have a need for the Indigo until a months later when I used a different Henna and I didn&#x27;t like the shade (it was the much raved about Red Raj, I just thought it was too cool toned for my coloring). So a few days after my last application of henna I mixed up two tablespoons of this Indigo powder with enough warm water to form a yogurt-like consistency. I then added 1/2 cup of a thick conditioner to the mixture and applied that all over my hair, leaving it to sit for half an hour. When I rinsed it out I had beautiful dark chocolate brown hair. I highly recommend this Indigo, it&#x27;s very finely milled and works like a dream. My only qualm is that the product took about a week and a half to get to me, but at this price and for the quality, I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and there was absolutely no change to my auburn colored hair. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Product came timely and it worked wonderfully on my hair</li>
            <li> Although the two-part process with henna is cumbersome, I don&#x27;t see myself ever purchasing over-the-counter commercial hair dye again. The result is a beautiful, non-artificial looking head of raven black hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my henna and indigo separately to dye my roots. The henna worked well, but the indigo never even released it&#x27;s dye. After leaving it in for 5 hours, it never turned blue, it stayed green. No change in hair color and now my roots are brights red while the rest of my hair is black. I have to now resort to commercial hair color because I don&#x27;t have time to get more indigo. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I felt like it coated my hair in like a black crumbly material, which did not actually dye my hair and flaked off. I might have done something wrong, but I know i followed the instructions to the T. I plan to use Bigen dye to get my hair black.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even specify that you need to purchase a separate &amp;#34;activator&amp;#34; henna powder, unless you look at the package.  Not to mention that the second product is conveniently expensive too. I hate being cheated into buying something else just so that the product I bought can work.</li>
            <li> I received Henna and Indigo 2 days ago and used it that same night. Well, last night I notice some hair breakage on my left back side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I can cover it up but I was under the impression that this was a natural product and could cause no damage if it was in fact 100% pure.  I am upset though. I was actually ordered more since it didn&#x27;t even turn my hair Jet Black but a darker richer brown. I actually ordered more so I could make my hair Jet Black but I just told the seller to cancel the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much followed the directions to a T and didn&#x27;t even leave it in that long. I also used a conditioner after since it&#x27;s drying to the hair. And I made sure to wash it out good. I also had no relaxer/perm/dyes in my hair before the Henna/Indigo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind my hair is naturally fragile, I can&#x27;t take relaxers or chemicals so I am wondering if this product was even pure or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in the 1st place? My hair never broke in 1 day before. I especially caution African Americans when considering this product.</li>
            <li> This I have by mistake. And I could never return it I have not used it. I think that it is for the hair.</li>
            <li> A must for after natural henna which takes out all the grey,but turns your hair orange.&lt;br /&gt;This will get you the dark brown to blackish color depending on how long you leave it on.I leave it only one hr.I get very dark brown with an auburn highlight.It looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friend, and her results were beautiful. Great all natural product for the price.  We will be placing another order along with Henna.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS IN COMBO WITH THE NUPUR</li>
            <li> Loved the ease of mixing the powder added coconut oil for extra moisture and work just fine.. only drawback was it did not completely cover the red that the henna had left on my grays, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad the different color contrast was ok.  Maybe after another application the color will completely take.  It did make my hair thicker and after a deep conditioner my curls lasted a good week without having to refresh them.</li>
            <li> I had read previous reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work but I tried it anyways just to find out it didn&#x27;t dye my hair at all. But don&#x27;t know maybe it was a bad batch, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it again though.</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone who is allergic to ppd in commercial hair dyes.  It is 100% natural and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get this product to work as described on the package.  Then I watched a uTube  video on how to mix this product up.  Then it worked and turned out just like it was supposed to.  I used it on samples of hair that was collected but not on my hair yet.  The henna that I ordered was either old or the colorless/yellow product instead of the red henna.</li>
            <li> I can use this power with confidents knowing it will cover my gray hair and strengthen it at the same time</li>
            <li> This stuff works quite well. Previously I had been using the Lush henna bars, which are super messy, but decided to try the old school method of hennaing and compare. Well, old school works better and lasts longer! I henna&#x27;d my hair with Jamila one week prior, wore my hair in twists and then three days ago untwisted my hair, washed it and then put the indigo on and covered in saran wrap  (just indigo, warm water and salt. I was too tired to get fancy with it). I left it on three hours, then rinsed it out with water only. It came out very dark, and my greys (I&#x27;m 20% grey)  went from flame red to dark brown. It&#x27;s been three days since and the greys are now dark dark brown, with the rest of my hair almost jet black. Next time I will mix it with the henna because I wasn&#x27;t aiming for it to be this dark. Looks nice though, and I just ordered three more packets of the 2012 crop (yeah it&#x27;s a bit old but it works and you gotta go with the crop that works for you).&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all, and I am prone to dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair came out so black ! I love their henna and indigo! It&#x27;s so fresh and free shipping !</li>
