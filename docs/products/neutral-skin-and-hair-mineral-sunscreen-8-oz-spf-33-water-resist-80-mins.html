            <li>Works perfect.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>Best price per ounce.  </li>
            <li>Best sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here I ordered this product and must say - this has proven to be one of the best sunscreens we have ever used for this price!</li>
            <li>This sunblock is great!!!</li>
            <li>Worked great for snorkeling, dolphins and all in Cancun!</li>
            <li>BEST EVER, never buying anything else, so happy I want to shout it from the mountain tops!!!!  </li>
            <li>This product is an awesome value.</li>
            <li>Excellent sunscreen -</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I feel like we all still got a lot of color while wearing this sunscreen, which leads me to believe that it&#x27;s not creating a very good barrier.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t get this again, however the price was very good.</li>
            <li>BUT for the price and amount it is very good deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of greasy sunscreens, but this one takes the cake!</li>
            <li>- it is all around a great choice.  </li>
            <li>Great sunblock that rates well on EWG.  </li>
            <li>Stays on even after swimming and neither of us have experienced sunburn while using it.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>Great EWG rating which is why I purchased</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection.</li>
            <li>It feels great and satisfies my needs of not bathing in something toxic to protect myself</li>
            <li>It does not have a smell, which is better than another brand that  i bought that smells fishy!!</li>
            <li>top of it all, it is the best value of all I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to friends because I have had nothing but good experiences with it.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2R8DGVS5C4X6U]]Rubs in really good.</li>
            <li>so you need a good moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li>, I feel it provides good protection.  </li>
            <li>, I imagine it would also be really good for kids.</li>
            <li>A good product for this price.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>and I like that it&#x27;s better for me and the environment, but this product is incredibly oily.</li>
            <li>Works good too.</li>
            <li>(his complexion is really fair) as well as the environment.</li>
            <li>--i have very fair skin and burn easily, and I did not get sunburned while wearing this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of mineral sunscreens and sure they prevent a burn but they do not make me look so great at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I liked this sunscreen, and thought it was a good value based on the size.</li>
            <li>OK a lot of words to say I Love It and will reorder always so plse don&#x27;t discontinue!!</li>
            <li>I love this biodegradable spf lotion!</li>
            <li>I like that this product is safe for the family, there is no discernible fragrance, and it works!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on like it</li>
            <li>Washing off with no soap but just the washcloth worked nicely to leave the skin</li>
            <li>so it spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;4) Seems to be effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The warm feeling disappears within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an effective sunblock until I can afford that 4 pack of UV Naturals from Australia.real</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an effective sunblock until I can afford that 4 pack of UV Naturals from Australia.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be some kind of sun-protective oil.</li>
            <li>you like paying good money for no results, you&#x27;ll love this crapola...</li>
            <li>Good natural sunscreen with a great EWG rating!</li>
            <li>Clean feel and works great.</li>
            <li>Feels good going on, easy to spread, and effective.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and burn really easily.</li>
            <li>If you use natural sunscreens you know that they aren&#x27;t the best when it comes to texture and application.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (unlike most sunscreens that contain zinc oxide), nice smell and protects well ( the after just beads up on the skin).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible -</li>
            <li>What we really love about this product is the protection level.</li>
            <li>The smell is also mid-level, not too overwhelming but it still smells.</li>
            <li>But there are much better mineral sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is reasonably priced and rubs in great.  </li>
            <li>But, it really is best to use on your body only, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>have never used a better sunscreen than this.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s reef safe however.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of reef safe</li>
            <li>I also love that the binder is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It was still working hours later when I took a walk at the park though it&#x27;s best to reapply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this for our trip to Cancun.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear out in the water and provides phenomenal sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to sit on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>this helps someone make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li>most sunscreens that felt good contain chemicals that are absorbed through the skin which increases the risk of skin cancer.</li>
            <li>Love how moisturizing it feels because of the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>What a cute bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Went on a bike ride midafternoon for an hour or so, came home and slathered more on.</li>
            <li>but I had a helmet with a visor, so was a bit more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Went on a bike ride midafternoon for an hour or so, came home and slathered more on.</li>
            <li>but I had a helmet with a visor, so was a bit more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worry free!</li>
            <li>Chemical free!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but it was way too greasy.  </li>
            <li>So, I guess it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t care about oil spots on your clothes, but I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is cheaper for the amount (which also made me want to love it)</li>
            <li>but once you factor in the damaged clothing, it costs a lot more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m losing more hair than I thought I was.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for our family snorkeling trip and was so pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>I was told I should purchase a reef safe sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much to get great coverage</li>
            <li>Also I have noticed that it works better for me if I apply it about 15 mins before getting out.</li>
            <li>By that time most of the ghostly look disappears and I feel that the protection gets even better when it has time to set in.</li>
            <li>but we are ok with it.</li>
            <li>Be sure and follow the directions on how often to apply this product.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I also love that it *</li>
            <li>For me, it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and it covers more surface area that way.  </li>
            <li>For the price you do get a good amount, so it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Then I read about the purple effects most zinc-based sunscreens create.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I was sent another at no charge, but I do love how the sunscreen works!</li>
            <li>Based on all the positive reviews, and the good rating on EWG, I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Worded pretty good at the eco park in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>Safe for reefs, safe for people, something to really feel good about bringing into your home.  </li>
            <li>We wanted a mineral-based sunscreen, and this fit the bill perfectly - an affordable and totally reliable level of protection.</li>
            <li>It has very good ingredients and does not make your skin look too white</li>
            <li>Great natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my kids&#x27; sensitive skin, and has protected us from burns all summer.</li>
            <li>Leaves a oily film but its all natural and is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it does the job</li>
            <li>But otherwise a nice product worth repurchasing.</li>
            <li>- Really good for the price - Highly recommended by EWG - I recommend!</li>
            <li>Worked great for fair skinned adults and our little ones.  </li>
            <li>I am sure there are applications in which it would be great (snorkeling - hence the &#x27;reef friendly&#x27; label), but I am going back to the not-as-natural Alba Botanicals ones until I find something better.</li>
            <li>applied this sunscreen 3-4 times a day for the three full days of the festival, which was very sunny and warm, and didn&#x27;t burn at all!</li>
            <li>so you can apply easily on your skin.</li>
            <li>Doesnt come off easy in the water or with sweat..</li>
            <li>so it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Applies easily.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get on my clothes, and it didn&#x27;t wash off easily because of the beeswax.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a safe sunscreen for the whole family that wouldn&#x27;t leave us all looking pasty, and this seemed like it would be great because as other reviewers had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit oily helping it spread very nicely.</li>
            <li>No pasty coloration, no weird smells, it&#x27;s just a truly effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>though my husband says he got burned wearing it, I thought coverage was fine)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy but otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>We loved how easily this sunscreen went on; especially compared to many barrier sunscreens we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>As a woman with melasma, a strong physical sunblock is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;After reading EWG&#x27;s latest reviews and scouring their recommendations on Amazon, the Neutral seemed like a good bet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then it just sat on top of my skin ... could easily just wipe right off.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>We visited Xel-Ha, which is an ecological water park</li>
            <li>Fragrance free</li>
            <li>Honestly, some of the reviews on this one made me question whether they were real or not, but I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>So many sunscreens are linked to cancer, but not this one because it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It spreads on smoothly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve tried every natural sunscreen on the market, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff, as the ingredient list is safe and others recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I needed something effective and versatile for my toddler, my older kiddo, my hubby and me.</li>
            <li>Love the simple &amp; safe ingredient list!</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that the sunscreen is okay</li>
            <li>Great product , goes a long way ..</li>
            <li>it is easily accessible.</li>
            <li>had to downgrade this to 2 stars from the original 3.</li>
            <li>great price considering how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>it goes on super smooth, not sticky -</li>
            <li>I also like that it is fragrance free, safe for the ocean, made in the USA, not tested on animals and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>It is scent free, which is nice as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love that this is natural and safe for lakes/oceans.</li>
            <li>over the years i&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect sunscreen that&#x27;s not too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li>only downside, though, is that it is fairly greasy--you will be shiny.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients were all good without the red flags like oxybenzone and parabens.</li>
            <li>I used to love to tan, but premature skin aging is real</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no bad odor or anything</li>
            <li>it feels warm as if my skin has been slightly warmed up with warm air.</li>
            <li>While it is true that it can feel mildly greasy</li>
            <li>It also seemed to provide adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li>love this sunscreen, I wish there were more of these products on the shelves locally.</li>
            <li>well it isn&#x27;t super noticeable however it does make you oily, because the sunscreen is designed to sit on your skin all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the price point is pretty good for a non toxic sunscreen such as this one.</li>
            <li>stuff worked pretty well!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted with a No Chemical zinc oxide sunscreen that works right away when applied!</li>
            <li>Works great - but you MUST reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li>* fragrance free - it works very well</li>
            <li>Looking for a naturally sourced mineral sunscreen, I tried decided to try this - mostly because it was 8 oz.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I was looking for an effective sunscreen with a short non-toxic inactive ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I found that I had no trouble with it being whitening or feeling like I had to rub it in more than I would with a non-natural sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It effectively prevented both sunburn and suntan while we were at the beach for a few days, so I am confident it works.  </li>
            <li>But that same greasiness is what kept our skin nice for the vacation.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s only worth bringing your own if you can find it for &amp;lt;$10, otherwise, just buy it at the park</li>
            <li>This is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>Like many, I&#x27;m on the search for a really good physical sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave you white.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like chemical sunscreen, so I was thrilled to find this natural product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of natural sunscreens I opted for this.  </li>
            <li>It feels slightly oily when I first put it on, but after a minute that greasiness disappear and my face feels great.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and provided 80 minutes of sun protection in moderate to strong May sun in Florida when we were sunbathing as well as swimming.</li>
            <li>(website rating safety of each ingredient in products), we tried this GREAT PRICED MINERAL SUNBLOCK--it has just a few, recognizable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little longer to rub in but it is worth the time to be able to use a safe product.  </li>
            <li>even though it is cheaper than  some of the other brands, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily seem like the best value, considering how much I have to apply.</li>
            <li>It leaves a bit of a white cast, but I haven&#x27;t found a good one that disappears completely.</li>
            <li>where you can joke about the lengths you must go to keep your pale skin from frying, not for walking to and from the office or something more formal where you want to wear more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this particular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get burned very much when I used it for vacation in Mexico.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very easy to apply too much, and that leaves your skin looking almost ashy white.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it can be oily if you get too hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>Great beach product, not so much for daily use because it leaves a hint of white (the zinc) and a bit oily (coconut oil),</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more bottles for myself and family and friends.</li>
            <li>For now it&#x27;s my favorite that I&#x27;ve tried for a physical sunscreen on the body.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the reviewers who complain that it won&#x27;t blend in aren&#x27;t really doing themselves any favors by trying to rub it in.</li>
            <li>neutral skin and hair mineral sunscreen, however, feels unbelievably comfortable on my skin, and it uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Hoping the Thinksport line works better until UV Naturals comes back to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first few days I thought this was pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so</li>
            <li>and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so</li>
            <li>And feels pretty sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li>I wore this mineral sunscreen today for one of the first sunny days here in Michigan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care, but it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li>I am trusting it for use on my husband during the blazing hot, side of the highway construction season.</li>
            <li>I recommend this sunscreen and will be ordering more for next summer!</li>
            <li>This is a sunblock is like few others and that&#x27;s mostly a good thing from my perspective.</li>
            <li>Rubs in nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave you ghost white like some either natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It is very oil and therefore is not my first pick for my face.  </li>
            <li>It felt very oily when first put on.</li>
            <li>No weird smell - Very oily -</li>
            <li>I never expected to make it out of that weekend with out at least a tiny bit of sunburn, and I&#x27;m really excited that I found a natural sunscreen that was able to protect my fair, sensitive skin in the most sunburn-y</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad or strong compared to other sunscreens, but it&#x27;s something I just don&#x27;t want to smell like...</li>
            <li>Perhaps because I tend to have dry skin, I actually found it very moisturizing and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, rubs in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face ghostly white.</li>
            <li>I try to add lotion or oils to it to make it easier to spread, but that may make it less effective .</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this new sunscreen option and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It seems to lack a certain amount of water resistance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what to do with this large bottle.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen really works, it does not irritate my skin, it really goes on clear, and it stays effective for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Sunblock rubs in fine with no white residue.  </li>
            <li>Then you can get used to how much sunscreen you&#x27;ll need to cover a certain amount of area.</li>
            <li>Today it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that isn&#x27;t jam packed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Really, really dislike this stuff.</li>
            <li>Found this sunscreen to be all it advertised and better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>so much so that I didn&#x27;t get much of a tan.</li>
            <li>much cheaper then buying once your over there.</li>
            <li>I do like it BUT its very greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is greasy feeling, so if you are very intolerant of that, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>It does leave a light, white tint on my skin.</li>
            <li>I used this product last weekend and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>You just need to rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Worked very well for my son and I at the beach and on the boat.</li>
            <li>it really runs.</li>
            <li>UV Naturals is now only available in 4 packs from Australia</li>
            <li>and you get nearly 2x as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t reapply it as much as I was supposed to though.</li>
            <li>But if you read the ingredients, the oil is from natural coconut oil and it can be absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li>i really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need a ton.  </li>
            <li>I was so much Exited and bought the Product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really is</li>
            <li>We will never buy anything else--and, it spreads on really well</li>
            <li>It is also really greasy.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen that leaves a white cast and it takes a lot to rub it in properly.</li>
            <li>Simple ingredients and no weird scents!!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I will keep searching for an Eco friendly product that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze.</li>
            <li>It contains coconut oil and other safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>We live in South Florida and spend most of the time outside in direct sun.</li>
            <li>The high level of zinc oxide really helps keep harmful rays out, and we put this on both ourselves and our kids without worry of it failing.</li>
            <li>when i was a kid, i could never sit still for sunscreen applications because i have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens were too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product says it is water resistant for 80 mins but even after a full day of spearfishing we reapply only once and have no problem at all.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth not having to use toxic sunscreen and is overall an effective product I use everyday</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get sunburned, so I&#x27;m using this mainly to avoid premature aging and skin cancer.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling incredibly smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, as is the case for almost all the sun-screens I&#x27;ve tried on market, particularly the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does go on thick and is a bit shiny once applied, but I am ok with that for what it does, protect my kids skin!  </li>
            <li>You get so much more product for the price compared to other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>so the bottle lasts FOREVER, even on large amounts of adult skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband runs his charter fishing company and it has been tough to find a good sunscreen that would work for him</li>
            <li>I reapply if at the beach all day, otherwise for normal days and school</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a PHYSICAL block that isn&#x27;t supposed to be absorbed like chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>We noticed that it does take some scrubbing to get it off in the shower, but the extra work is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not really crazy about the sunscreen to begin with and definitely not wanting to look a touch of purple, I continued my search.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be effective, and I still have a half a bottle left, but I wish it was gone.</li>
            <li>New Mexico</li>
            <li>Gonna have to try and find something new again...</li>
            <li>I also like that this product is fragrance free, none of that fake &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent that is in so many sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may be able to see some white in the crease of my elbow, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear with just the slightest hint of shimmer and protects your skin without any harmful ingredients!</li>
            <li>It goes on slightly white at first</li>
            <li>Seems pretty safe from the ingredients list, but it is pretty difficult to spread well and you will end up a shade or two lighter wherever you put it on.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little chalky but it rubs out easily.</li>
            <li>(just make sure to rub it in as well as as possible since it has zinc as an active ingredient).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to mineral sunscreen and at first I noticed that this feels different on your skin than other sunscreens - but quickly I grew to like the way</li>
            <li>Because the bottle was NOT sealed, don&#x27;t know if they put other stuff in it, or if the ingredients are truly what they say it is, plus the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that it does dry clear with only a hint of a whitish tint and one would have to look really hard, which I was doing, to notice that it was there.  </li>
            <li>The product was ok, however, bottle was not sealed, &amp; I only got a little over 1/2 bottle.  </li>
            <li>You get twice as much for less $ than many of the other options.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Who wants to soak up some oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate through their sensitive facial pores?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mineral, so don&#x27;t be surprised when it turns your skin white/grayish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this natural product again.</li>
            <li>for a reasonable price, and I use sunscreen (&amp; reapply) daily in my job.</li>
            <li>Friends who I have let use it have been pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was thus pleasantly surprised when I returned from the beach neither ghostly nor sunburnt.</li>
            <li>Used on face too, didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Because it is a natural sunscreen, I was hoping to also use on my face.  </li>
            <li>but then it soaks in and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it disappeared into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and pasty, the whole family loves it</li>
            <li>I applied this lotion about 5-10 minutes before going surfing last week, and got really burnt.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my olive skin look white as some reviewers noted, although too much in one spot will make your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for that much was the scent.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the salt water, my face felt soft and moist by the end of the day because of the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>This product covers well and is leaves your skin soft from the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>It did not leave the white residue on the skin and protected against the sun very well.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I like using a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who want natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Claim that it doesn&#x27;t make you all white is absolutely bogus</li>
            <li>I immediately discovered I can&#x27;t use it on my sensitive face and neck.</li>
            <li>No one else had this problem, so maybe I was using too much, or maybe my skin has different absorbtion issues!!</li>
            <li>It does have a strange greasy feeling at first, but it does fade after some time.</li>
            <li>Tested on Mom, Dad and two kids for two weeks solid on very sunny beach.</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen all summer and never got burned (although I try not to spend a ton of time in direct sunlight anyway).</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s only one way I can conceive of this working for anyone-and that&#x27;s to use the tiniest, most imperceptible amount (which would render the SPF ineffective).</li>
            <li>I tried it under my CC cream for extra sun protection (CC cream is only SPF 15), with pressed powder, and it look good initially, but after a few hours in the sun it caused my makeup to look blotchy/clump in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be good for the fishies, but it is LOUSY for protecting people from the sun.</li>
            <li>You only need very little of it as it is slightly greasy when you first apply but it gets absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I will be trying out some other screens, and for the meantime sticking with my Alba Botanical sunscreen, which is more expensive but not greasy and more water resistant.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether this is a good or bad thing, but everytime when I first apply it to my skin</li>
            <li>Even after scrubbing with the soap/detergent mix, a fine layer of caked zinc oxide remains in the small creases of your skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really leave the white residue that is common with mineral sunscreens, and rubs in easy.</li>
            <li>I was only out for about an hour, so I shouldn&#x27;t have needed to reapply, but apparently you really need to put this stuff on way before going in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My arms in particular showed streaks, and the white pooled up in  creases in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very pale, sensitive skin, so sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out/itch is a huge priority for me in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have Dark Patches on My Face Due to Sun Damage by UVB&lt;br /&gt; &amp; UVA rays and was advised by My Physician to use an SPF product with SPF  content of More than 30% Whoch  has Zinc and titanium Dioxide.</li>
            <li>Compared to other natural sunscreens, this one is well-priced and has actually recognizable ingredients.</li>
            <li>It leaves a tint of a blueish/ purpleish if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in very well, but that is avoidable by using a little at a time on each area of your body.</li>
            <li>Being an Irish bloke, with medium cauliflower complexion, I have long been resigned to looking super kabuki whilst wearing various brands of mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I will be trying a new sunscreen next.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, this comes out of the tube easily and has a thin enough consistency that it spreads on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The coconut oil formulation seems to also prevent the dry skin that can occur with so much sand, sun, and salt.  </li>
            <li>(I mean it doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell)--not something that I care about at all (one way or another), but I know a lot of people with allergy don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>It is super runny, has a slight off smell and is just gross to rub on your skin.</li>
            <li>Some people say it makes them look a little ghostly, which can be true, but only until if you apply a thicker layer.</li>
            <li>I noticed sometimes it would collect in the crease of my elbow, but generally it rubbed in and stayed put.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is one of my favorites among the mineral sunscreens because it is (relatively) inexpensive and goes on fairly clear.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled on these and based on reviews and the promise to go on clear without the extra greasy feel, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My formerly intolerant-of-oil partner was completely won over and is ordering some for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>needed to find  another natural mineral sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out, leave me pasty or bluish white, and would WORK.</li>
            <li>used it in direct sun in mexico for an entire week, diving, snorkeling, swimming.</li>
            <li>A little bit tricky to get the right amount from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Once I learned that a little bit of this product goes a long way I found it easy to rub in and didn&#x27;t have a problem with a white residue.  </li>
            <li>However, when I did my research most of the reef safe sunscreens tend to leave a ghostly white tint and being a black woman, with a medium chocolate complexion, I was desperately trying to avoid looking like Casper.  </li>
            <li>I do have rather dry skin so for those with oily or normal skin</li>
            <li>It does leave a slight whitish hue when you first apply it, but I notice if you rub it in well and wait the recommended 15 minutes,  it goes away.</li>
            <li>We had to use a body wash mixed with Dawn dishwasher liquid to get this off and it usually takes two showers to get fully clean.</li>
            <li>bought for snorkeling in Hawaii (because of the product&#x27;s natural ingredients) to have as little affect on the living reefs.&lt;br /&gt;Applied 15 mins before going in the water and reapplied after, and it really worked as fare as coverage,</li>
            <li>today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li>today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t too white or too thick.</li>
            <li>I found that while it felt a little greasy at first, after it had been on my skin for a couple of minutes, I did not feel greasy or sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>This is thick sunscreen and is a bit hard to get off, but works very well and contains no nasty chemicals</li>
            <li>I ordered this sunscreen because it was a decent value (8 oz bottle for a little over $10) for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that is just sits on the skin and never really absorbs, so you are just very oily the entire time.</li>
            <li>I only use zinc oxide screens, and this one is rare in that it doesn&#x27;t leave a pale sheen on my face, so I can use it daily.</li>
            <li>When I read that this product would dry clear I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Apply easily--it spreads out on my skin with a little gentle massage&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>This sunscreen costs just a little more than half of what I&#x27;ve paid for other types of sunblock.  </li>

            <li> Best sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here I ordered this product and must say - this has proven to be one of the best sunscreens we have ever used for this price!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great for snorkeling, dolphins and all in Cancun!</li>
            <li> BEST EVER, never buying anything else, so happy I want to shout it from the mountain tops!!!!  </li>
            <li> This product is an awesome value.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen -</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I feel like we all still got a lot of color while wearing this sunscreen, which leads me to believe that it&#x27;s not creating a very good barrier.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t get this again, however the price was very good.</li>
            <li> BUT for the price and amount it is very good deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of greasy sunscreens, but this one takes the cake!</li>
            <li> - it is all around a great choice.  </li>
            <li> Great sunblock that rates well on EWG.  </li>
            <li> Stays on even after swimming and neither of us have experienced sunburn while using it.</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> Great EWG rating which is why I purchased</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection.</li>
            <li> It feels great and satisfies my needs of not bathing in something toxic to protect myself</li>
            <li> It does not have a smell, which is better than another brand that  i bought that smells fishy!!</li>
            <li> top of it all, it is the best value of all I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to friends because I have had nothing but good experiences with it.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2R8DGVS5C4X6U]]Rubs in really good.</li>
            <li> so you need a good moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> , I feel it provides good protection.  </li>
            <li> , I imagine it would also be really good for kids.</li>
            <li> A good product for this price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> and I like that it&#x27;s better for me and the environment, but this product is incredibly oily.</li>
            <li> Works good too.</li>
            <li> (his complexion is really fair) as well as the environment.</li>
            <li> --i have very fair skin and burn easily, and I did not get sunburned while wearing this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of mineral sunscreens and sure they prevent a burn but they do not make me look so great at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I liked this sunscreen, and thought it was a good value based on the size.</li>
            <li> OK a lot of words to say I Love It and will reorder always so plse don&#x27;t discontinue!!</li>
            <li> I love this biodegradable spf lotion!</li>
            <li> I like that this product is safe for the family, there is no discernible fragrance, and it works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on like it</li>
            <li> Washing off with no soap but just the washcloth worked nicely to leave the skin</li>
            <li> so it spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;4) Seems to be effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The warm feeling disappears within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an effective sunblock until I can afford that 4 pack of UV Naturals from Australia.real</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an effective sunblock until I can afford that 4 pack of UV Naturals from Australia.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be some kind of sun-protective oil.</li>
            <li> you like paying good money for no results, you&#x27;ll love this crapola...</li>
            <li> Good natural sunscreen with a great EWG rating!</li>
            <li> Clean feel and works great.</li>
            <li> Feels good going on, easy to spread, and effective.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and burn really easily.</li>
            <li> If you use natural sunscreens you know that they aren&#x27;t the best when it comes to texture and application.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (unlike most sunscreens that contain zinc oxide), nice smell and protects well ( the after just beads up on the skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible -</li>
            <li> What we really love about this product is the protection level.</li>
            <li> The smell is also mid-level, not too overwhelming but it still smells.</li>
            <li> But there are much better mineral sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is reasonably priced and rubs in great.  </li>
            <li> But, it really is best to use on your body only, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> have never used a better sunscreen than this.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s reef safe however.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of reef safe</li>
            <li> I also love that the binder is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It was still working hours later when I took a walk at the park though it&#x27;s best to reapply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this for our trip to Cancun.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear out in the water and provides phenomenal sun protection.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to sit on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> this helps someone make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li> most sunscreens that felt good contain chemicals that are absorbed through the skin which increases the risk of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Love how moisturizing it feels because of the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> What a cute bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Went on a bike ride midafternoon for an hour or so, came home and slathered more on.</li>
            <li> but I had a helmet with a visor, so was a bit more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Went on a bike ride midafternoon for an hour or so, came home and slathered more on.</li>
            <li> but I had a helmet with a visor, so was a bit more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worry free!</li>
            <li> Chemical free!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was way too greasy.  </li>
            <li> So, I guess it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t care about oil spots on your clothes, but I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is cheaper for the amount (which also made me want to love it)</li>
            <li> but once you factor in the damaged clothing, it costs a lot more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing more hair than I thought I was.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for our family snorkeling trip and was so pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I was told I should purchase a reef safe sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to get great coverage</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed that it works better for me if I apply it about 15 mins before getting out.</li>
            <li> By that time most of the ghostly look disappears and I feel that the protection gets even better when it has time to set in.</li>
            <li> but we are ok with it.</li>
            <li> Be sure and follow the directions on how often to apply this product.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I also love that it *</li>
            <li> For me, it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and it covers more surface area that way.  </li>
            <li> For the price you do get a good amount, so it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Then I read about the purple effects most zinc-based sunscreens create.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I was sent another at no charge, but I do love how the sunscreen works!</li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews, and the good rating on EWG, I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Worded pretty good at the eco park in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> Safe for reefs, safe for people, something to really feel good about bringing into your home.  </li>
            <li> We wanted a mineral-based sunscreen, and this fit the bill perfectly - an affordable and totally reliable level of protection.</li>
            <li> It has very good ingredients and does not make your skin look too white</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my kids&#x27; sensitive skin, and has protected us from burns all summer.</li>
            <li> Leaves a oily film but its all natural and is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it does the job</li>
            <li> But otherwise a nice product worth repurchasing.</li>
            <li> - Really good for the price - Highly recommended by EWG - I recommend!</li>
            <li> Worked great for fair skinned adults and our little ones.  </li>
            <li> I am sure there are applications in which it would be great (snorkeling - hence the &#x27;reef friendly&#x27; label), but I am going back to the not-as-natural Alba Botanicals ones until I find something better.</li>
            <li> applied this sunscreen 3-4 times a day for the three full days of the festival, which was very sunny and warm, and didn&#x27;t burn at all!</li>
            <li> so you can apply easily on your skin.</li>
            <li> Doesnt come off easy in the water or with sweat..</li>
            <li> so it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Applies easily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get on my clothes, and it didn&#x27;t wash off easily because of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a safe sunscreen for the whole family that wouldn&#x27;t leave us all looking pasty, and this seemed like it would be great because as other reviewers had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit oily helping it spread very nicely.</li>
            <li> No pasty coloration, no weird smells, it&#x27;s just a truly effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> though my husband says he got burned wearing it, I thought coverage was fine)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy but otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> We loved how easily this sunscreen went on; especially compared to many barrier sunscreens we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> As a woman with melasma, a strong physical sunblock is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;After reading EWG&#x27;s latest reviews and scouring their recommendations on Amazon, the Neutral seemed like a good bet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then it just sat on top of my skin ... could easily just wipe right off.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> We visited Xel-Ha, which is an ecological water park</li>
            <li> Fragrance free</li>
            <li> Honestly, some of the reviews on this one made me question whether they were real or not, but I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> So many sunscreens are linked to cancer, but not this one because it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It spreads on smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve tried every natural sunscreen on the market, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, as the ingredient list is safe and others recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I needed something effective and versatile for my toddler, my older kiddo, my hubby and me.</li>
            <li> Love the simple &amp; safe ingredient list!</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that the sunscreen is okay</li>
            <li> Great product , goes a long way ..</li>
            <li> it is easily accessible.</li>
            <li> had to downgrade this to 2 stars from the original 3.</li>
            <li> great price considering how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> it goes on super smooth, not sticky -</li>
            <li> I also like that it is fragrance free, safe for the ocean, made in the USA, not tested on animals and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> It is scent free, which is nice as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this is natural and safe for lakes/oceans.</li>
            <li> over the years i&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect sunscreen that&#x27;s not too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> only downside, though, is that it is fairly greasy--you will be shiny.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients were all good without the red flags like oxybenzone and parabens.</li>
            <li> I used to love to tan, but premature skin aging is real</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no bad odor or anything</li>
            <li> it feels warm as if my skin has been slightly warmed up with warm air.</li>
            <li> While it is true that it can feel mildly greasy</li>
            <li> It also seemed to provide adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen, I wish there were more of these products on the shelves locally.</li>
            <li> well it isn&#x27;t super noticeable however it does make you oily, because the sunscreen is designed to sit on your skin all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the price point is pretty good for a non toxic sunscreen such as this one.</li>
            <li> stuff worked pretty well!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted with a No Chemical zinc oxide sunscreen that works right away when applied!</li>
            <li> Works great - but you MUST reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> * fragrance free - it works very well</li>
            <li> Looking for a naturally sourced mineral sunscreen, I tried decided to try this - mostly because it was 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was looking for an effective sunscreen with a short non-toxic inactive ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I found that I had no trouble with it being whitening or feeling like I had to rub it in more than I would with a non-natural sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It effectively prevented both sunburn and suntan while we were at the beach for a few days, so I am confident it works.  </li>
            <li> But that same greasiness is what kept our skin nice for the vacation.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s only worth bringing your own if you can find it for &amp;lt;$10, otherwise, just buy it at the park</li>
            <li> This is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> Like many, I&#x27;m on the search for a really good physical sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave you white.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like chemical sunscreen, so I was thrilled to find this natural product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of natural sunscreens I opted for this.  </li>
            <li> It feels slightly oily when I first put it on, but after a minute that greasiness disappear and my face feels great.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and provided 80 minutes of sun protection in moderate to strong May sun in Florida when we were sunbathing as well as swimming.</li>
            <li> (website rating safety of each ingredient in products), we tried this GREAT PRICED MINERAL SUNBLOCK--it has just a few, recognizable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little longer to rub in but it is worth the time to be able to use a safe product.  </li>
            <li> even though it is cheaper than  some of the other brands, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily seem like the best value, considering how much I have to apply.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a white cast, but I haven&#x27;t found a good one that disappears completely.</li>
            <li> where you can joke about the lengths you must go to keep your pale skin from frying, not for walking to and from the office or something more formal where you want to wear more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this particular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned very much when I used it for vacation in Mexico.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very easy to apply too much, and that leaves your skin looking almost ashy white.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it can be oily if you get too hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> Great beach product, not so much for daily use because it leaves a hint of white (the zinc) and a bit oily (coconut oil),</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more bottles for myself and family and friends.</li>
            <li> For now it&#x27;s my favorite that I&#x27;ve tried for a physical sunscreen on the body.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the reviewers who complain that it won&#x27;t blend in aren&#x27;t really doing themselves any favors by trying to rub it in.</li>
            <li> neutral skin and hair mineral sunscreen, however, feels unbelievably comfortable on my skin, and it uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Hoping the Thinksport line works better until UV Naturals comes back to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first few days I thought this was pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so</li>
            <li> and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so</li>
            <li> And feels pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li> I wore this mineral sunscreen today for one of the first sunny days here in Michigan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care, but it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li> I am trusting it for use on my husband during the blazing hot, side of the highway construction season.</li>
            <li> I recommend this sunscreen and will be ordering more for next summer!</li>
            <li> This is a sunblock is like few others and that&#x27;s mostly a good thing from my perspective.</li>
            <li> Rubs in nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave you ghost white like some either natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It is very oil and therefore is not my first pick for my face.  </li>
            <li> It felt very oily when first put on.</li>
            <li> No weird smell - Very oily -</li>
            <li> I never expected to make it out of that weekend with out at least a tiny bit of sunburn, and I&#x27;m really excited that I found a natural sunscreen that was able to protect my fair, sensitive skin in the most sunburn-y</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad or strong compared to other sunscreens, but it&#x27;s something I just don&#x27;t want to smell like...</li>
            <li> Perhaps because I tend to have dry skin, I actually found it very moisturizing and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, rubs in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face ghostly white.</li>
            <li> I try to add lotion or oils to it to make it easier to spread, but that may make it less effective .</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this new sunscreen option and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to lack a certain amount of water resistance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what to do with this large bottle.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen really works, it does not irritate my skin, it really goes on clear, and it stays effective for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Sunblock rubs in fine with no white residue.  </li>
            <li> Then you can get used to how much sunscreen you&#x27;ll need to cover a certain amount of area.</li>
            <li> Today it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that isn&#x27;t jam packed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really, really dislike this stuff.</li>
            <li> Found this sunscreen to be all it advertised and better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> so much so that I didn&#x27;t get much of a tan.</li>
            <li> much cheaper then buying once your over there.</li>
            <li> I do like it BUT its very greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is greasy feeling, so if you are very intolerant of that, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does leave a light, white tint on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product last weekend and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> You just need to rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my son and I at the beach and on the boat.</li>
            <li> it really runs.</li>
            <li> UV Naturals is now only available in 4 packs from Australia</li>
            <li> and you get nearly 2x as much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t reapply it as much as I was supposed to though.</li>
            <li> But if you read the ingredients, the oil is from natural coconut oil and it can be absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> i really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need a ton.  </li>
            <li> I was so much Exited and bought the Product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really is</li>
            <li> We will never buy anything else--and, it spreads on really well</li>
            <li> It is also really greasy.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen that leaves a white cast and it takes a lot to rub it in properly.</li>
            <li> Simple ingredients and no weird scents!!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I will keep searching for an Eco friendly product that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze.</li>
            <li> It contains coconut oil and other safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> We live in South Florida and spend most of the time outside in direct sun.</li>
            <li> The high level of zinc oxide really helps keep harmful rays out, and we put this on both ourselves and our kids without worry of it failing.</li>
            <li> when i was a kid, i could never sit still for sunscreen applications because i have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens were too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product says it is water resistant for 80 mins but even after a full day of spearfishing we reapply only once and have no problem at all.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth not having to use toxic sunscreen and is overall an effective product I use everyday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get sunburned, so I&#x27;m using this mainly to avoid premature aging and skin cancer.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling incredibly smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, as is the case for almost all the sun-screens I&#x27;ve tried on market, particularly the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does go on thick and is a bit shiny once applied, but I am ok with that for what it does, protect my kids skin!  </li>
            <li> You get so much more product for the price compared to other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> so the bottle lasts FOREVER, even on large amounts of adult skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband runs his charter fishing company and it has been tough to find a good sunscreen that would work for him</li>
            <li> I reapply if at the beach all day, otherwise for normal days and school</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a PHYSICAL block that isn&#x27;t supposed to be absorbed like chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> We noticed that it does take some scrubbing to get it off in the shower, but the extra work is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about the sunscreen to begin with and definitely not wanting to look a touch of purple, I continued my search.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to be effective, and I still have a half a bottle left, but I wish it was gone.</li>
            <li> New Mexico</li>
            <li> Gonna have to try and find something new again...</li>
            <li> I also like that this product is fragrance free, none of that fake &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent that is in so many sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may be able to see some white in the crease of my elbow, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear with just the slightest hint of shimmer and protects your skin without any harmful ingredients!</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly white at first</li>
            <li> Seems pretty safe from the ingredients list, but it is pretty difficult to spread well and you will end up a shade or two lighter wherever you put it on.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little chalky but it rubs out easily.</li>
            <li> (just make sure to rub it in as well as as possible since it has zinc as an active ingredient).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to mineral sunscreen and at first I noticed that this feels different on your skin than other sunscreens - but quickly I grew to like the way</li>
            <li> Because the bottle was NOT sealed, don&#x27;t know if they put other stuff in it, or if the ingredients are truly what they say it is, plus the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that it does dry clear with only a hint of a whitish tint and one would have to look really hard, which I was doing, to notice that it was there.  </li>
            <li> The product was ok, however, bottle was not sealed, &amp; I only got a little over 1/2 bottle.  </li>
            <li> You get twice as much for less $ than many of the other options.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Who wants to soak up some oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate through their sensitive facial pores?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mineral, so don&#x27;t be surprised when it turns your skin white/grayish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this natural product again.</li>
            <li> for a reasonable price, and I use sunscreen (&amp; reapply) daily in my job.</li>
            <li> Friends who I have let use it have been pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was thus pleasantly surprised when I returned from the beach neither ghostly nor sunburnt.</li>
            <li> Used on face too, didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Because it is a natural sunscreen, I was hoping to also use on my face.  </li>
            <li> but then it soaks in and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it disappeared into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and pasty, the whole family loves it</li>
            <li> I applied this lotion about 5-10 minutes before going surfing last week, and got really burnt.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my olive skin look white as some reviewers noted, although too much in one spot will make your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for that much was the scent.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the salt water, my face felt soft and moist by the end of the day because of the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> This product covers well and is leaves your skin soft from the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave the white residue on the skin and protected against the sun very well.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I like using a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who want natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Claim that it doesn&#x27;t make you all white is absolutely bogus</li>
            <li> I immediately discovered I can&#x27;t use it on my sensitive face and neck.</li>
            <li> No one else had this problem, so maybe I was using too much, or maybe my skin has different absorbtion issues!!</li>
            <li> It does have a strange greasy feeling at first, but it does fade after some time.</li>
            <li> Tested on Mom, Dad and two kids for two weeks solid on very sunny beach.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen all summer and never got burned (although I try not to spend a ton of time in direct sunlight anyway).</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s only one way I can conceive of this working for anyone-and that&#x27;s to use the tiniest, most imperceptible amount (which would render the SPF ineffective).</li>
            <li> I tried it under my CC cream for extra sun protection (CC cream is only SPF 15), with pressed powder, and it look good initially, but after a few hours in the sun it caused my makeup to look blotchy/clump in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be good for the fishies, but it is LOUSY for protecting people from the sun.</li>
            <li> You only need very little of it as it is slightly greasy when you first apply but it gets absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I will be trying out some other screens, and for the meantime sticking with my Alba Botanical sunscreen, which is more expensive but not greasy and more water resistant.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether this is a good or bad thing, but everytime when I first apply it to my skin</li>
            <li> Even after scrubbing with the soap/detergent mix, a fine layer of caked zinc oxide remains in the small creases of your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really leave the white residue that is common with mineral sunscreens, and rubs in easy.</li>
            <li> I was only out for about an hour, so I shouldn&#x27;t have needed to reapply, but apparently you really need to put this stuff on way before going in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arms in particular showed streaks, and the white pooled up in  creases in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale, sensitive skin, so sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out/itch is a huge priority for me in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have Dark Patches on My Face Due to Sun Damage by UVB&lt;br /&gt; &amp; UVA rays and was advised by My Physician to use an SPF product with SPF  content of More than 30% Whoch  has Zinc and titanium Dioxide.</li>
            <li> Compared to other natural sunscreens, this one is well-priced and has actually recognizable ingredients.</li>
            <li> It leaves a tint of a blueish/ purpleish if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in very well, but that is avoidable by using a little at a time on each area of your body.</li>
            <li> Being an Irish bloke, with medium cauliflower complexion, I have long been resigned to looking super kabuki whilst wearing various brands of mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I will be trying a new sunscreen next.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, this comes out of the tube easily and has a thin enough consistency that it spreads on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The coconut oil formulation seems to also prevent the dry skin that can occur with so much sand, sun, and salt.  </li>
            <li> (I mean it doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell)--not something that I care about at all (one way or another), but I know a lot of people with allergy don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> It is super runny, has a slight off smell and is just gross to rub on your skin.</li>
            <li> Some people say it makes them look a little ghostly, which can be true, but only until if you apply a thicker layer.</li>
            <li> I noticed sometimes it would collect in the crease of my elbow, but generally it rubbed in and stayed put.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is one of my favorites among the mineral sunscreens because it is (relatively) inexpensive and goes on fairly clear.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled on these and based on reviews and the promise to go on clear without the extra greasy feel, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My formerly intolerant-of-oil partner was completely won over and is ordering some for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> needed to find  another natural mineral sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out, leave me pasty or bluish white, and would WORK.</li>
            <li> used it in direct sun in mexico for an entire week, diving, snorkeling, swimming.</li>
            <li> A little bit tricky to get the right amount from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Once I learned that a little bit of this product goes a long way I found it easy to rub in and didn&#x27;t have a problem with a white residue.  </li>
            <li> However, when I did my research most of the reef safe sunscreens tend to leave a ghostly white tint and being a black woman, with a medium chocolate complexion, I was desperately trying to avoid looking like Casper.  </li>
            <li> I do have rather dry skin so for those with oily or normal skin</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight whitish hue when you first apply it, but I notice if you rub it in well and wait the recommended 15 minutes,  it goes away.</li>
            <li> We had to use a body wash mixed with Dawn dishwasher liquid to get this off and it usually takes two showers to get fully clean.</li>
            <li> bought for snorkeling in Hawaii (because of the product&#x27;s natural ingredients) to have as little affect on the living reefs.&lt;br /&gt;Applied 15 mins before going in the water and reapplied after, and it really worked as fare as coverage,</li>
            <li> today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li> today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t too white or too thick.</li>
            <li> I found that while it felt a little greasy at first, after it had been on my skin for a couple of minutes, I did not feel greasy or sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> This is thick sunscreen and is a bit hard to get off, but works very well and contains no nasty chemicals</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen because it was a decent value (8 oz bottle for a little over $10) for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that is just sits on the skin and never really absorbs, so you are just very oily the entire time.</li>
            <li> I only use zinc oxide screens, and this one is rare in that it doesn&#x27;t leave a pale sheen on my face, so I can use it daily.</li>
            <li> When I read that this product would dry clear I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Apply easily--it spreads out on my skin with a little gentle massage&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> This sunscreen costs just a little more than half of what I&#x27;ve paid for other types of sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you are on a tight budget but still want a decent non-chemical sunscreen, get this one.</li>
            <li> Goes on without a film, unlike other natural sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> many natural cream formulas on the market are too clumpy, thus very difficult to get out of the tube.</li>
            <li> but that is typical of all natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> home, showered (you do have to scrub this stuff off), and found my chest was pink, my arms brown and my upper back is burnt.</li>
            <li> home, showered (you do have to scrub this stuff off), and found my chest was pink, my arms brown and my upper back is burnt.</li>
            <li> Gives me a little of that strange, ghosty hue, but it goes on MUCH easier than other mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I might&#x27;ve attributed that to the unusually hot and sunny days this past week EXCEPT that I wore the remainder of my UV Naturals on my face yesterday while using this stuff on my shoulders, chest and back...and my face did NOT burn while the other areas did.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing different about it and other white cream sunscreens there.  </li>
            <li> would recommend it more for the beach or sitting outside in a casual setting (baseball games!)</li>
            <li> Wore it during a long summer month trekking through the Himalaya and did not burn once.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t look like I spent a week at the beach</li>
            <li> I can attest to how well it keeps one from burning (for me, my strategy is stay in the shade, wear a hat, and limit how long I&#x27;m in the sun).  </li>
            <li> We live in a climate which is very harsh in terms of the sun&#x27;s impact. . .  </li>
            <li> We are going to keep using this product because we haven&#x27;t found the same level of protection in other products, but would like it if application was a bit easier.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it seemed expensive, but it is actually cheaper than similar brands.</li>
            <li> Four other people were using this, but for some reason, when I used it it didn&#x27;t absorb well, and I was covered in white goop!</li>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t stand to have it on my skin very long .</li>
            <li> Stays on well though uc applied and let dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> look when apply the sunscreen is to use small amounts for small areas at first.</li>
            <li> My family goes to a lot of festivals and are very active, spending lots of times outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it is not causing black heads or acne so far.</li>
            <li> Just used it in FL for 14days--not a single person is even slighted tanned!  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times at the end of summer and will continue using it next summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he was covered with sand that was stuck to his still wet skin.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen never soaked in and remained wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> As some mentioned it is harder to wash this product off even with soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and smooth (unlike alba botanica and badger&#x27;s thick creams), but it still stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using California Baby and Blue Lizard products, which are thick and pasty white.  </li>
            <li> I have used it quite a few times without any irritation or breakouts, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a white residue as other mineral sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> --a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s oiler than other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> know that some other reviewers have found the formula to be greasy, but I can&#x27;t say that was a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well while hiking and skiing</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY greasy.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;But that leads me to the other issue-</li>
            <li> In my opinion that is a really small price for the overall results and the fact that it is not harmful to the environment..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain nano-particle zinc oxide and it doesn&#x27;t have any active ingredients other than zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t buy again as there are other options that are less greasy.</li>
            <li> Bottle came half empty!</li>
            <li> It is much less chalky than other mineral sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> Also if your hair is dark I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this on your hair.</li>
            <li> This does not stay on at all, doesn&#x27;t rub in, gets on cloths and ruins them.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I reapplied Neutral after just a couple hours, wasn&#x27;t even in the sun as long as I usually am, and I STILL got burnt.</li>
            <li> I reapplied Neutral after just a couple hours, wasn&#x27;t even in the sun as long as I usually am, and I STILL got burnt.</li>
            <li> My only negative would be that it did leave the skin feeling and looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have recently learned the difference between mineral and chemical based sunscreens, and decided if I am going to put something on myself and children, it should be the least harmful.  </li>
            <li> However, it is so white and thick; I can never seem to blend it in.  </li>
            <li> the fact that I tanned a little may be due to that.</li>
            <li> but with that said it does fade and feel less oily after about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I realized that my previous product dissolved the nail polish on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> reapply every hour and a half to two hours, which you should be doing anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the coconut oil content, but preceded to buy because of high non-nano zinc content.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen worked as stated need to reapply after 90 minutes but our bottle leaked and made a mess.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ll surely take this bad boy with me!</li>
            <li> This is a creamy silky lotion, a little runny.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying</li>
            <li> We got a little color but did not burn...</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep data base and ordered it because of its positive environmental and health reviews as well as its affordability.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing with coconut oil base, also makes it smooth on well and disappears into skin after a little rubbing in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using UV Naturals for years, so when they discontinued U.S. distribution a few months ago, I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do for my sunblock needs.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a solution, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have dangerous chemicals or micro ingridients, but it&#x27;s super thick and you need a lot for a small area.</li>
            <li> It is little bit on the watery side and leave white residue that are difficult to remove</li>
            <li> The biggest negative for me was that it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the only mineral sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look weird.</li>
            <li> You will have to put on a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> This past weekend at a 3 day outdoor music festival I had brought a non-natural 50spf water resistant sunscreen with me, but opted to try Neutral Skin and Hair Mineral Sunscreen when a friend offered it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit confused about the brand name and to try to find other products offered, but this seems to be it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find sunscreen without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it is VERY thick, and extremely difficult to actually get into the skin</li>
            <li> It is the least whitening of all the mineral sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream that I would never put on my hair or my skin, did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick like a lotion</li>
            <li> It is quite thick though and needs some exfoliation in the shower to get it all off.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the assurance that you&#x27;re not getting suspect chemicals into your bloodstream, but be prepared to scrub!</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy feeling, so not ideal for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this sunscreen, as it is far too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at reapplying so</li>
            <li> And after a few applications, I felt like my skin was suffocating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not consistently good with putting on sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> but I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Application is easy--it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> As a mom of 2 kids, we are trying to remove unnecessary chemicals, fillers from our food/skin products etc.  </li>
            <li> wearing active clothes and the oil was so bad that the clothes now have spots that won&#x27;t come out in the wash.</li>
            <li> It felt absolutely disgusting, but I waited it out, hoping that some of the oil would absorb (it never did-hours later, the thick layer of oil was still intact, along with all the hairs and bits of debris that it</li>
            <li> Some pressed powder cuts down on the shine, but it&#x27;s not a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li> Shook up thoroughly but burned so so bad after little time and was reapplying often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to wash off though!</li>
            <li> No strange, nasty ingredients seeping into your pores.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> but if you are tan like myself or darker, be wary.</li>
            <li> What a waste and a painful lesson!</li>
            <li> Part of my bottle leaked out during shipment since it arrived in just a bubble mailer, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> lastly, it is impossible to beat the price given the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both my kids hate it</li>
            <li> My daughters hate some of the brands I&#x27;ve used on their face for being &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34;, but this one didn&#x27;t bother them!</li>
            <li> worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t stand to have it on my skin very long . I did try to like it .</li>
            <li> Worked great for fair skinned adults and our little ones.  Didn&#x27;t use it on our hair but our bodies were well-protected and the coverage did last our dips in the Gulf</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen.  It&#x27;s mineral, so don&#x27;t be surprised when it turns your skin white/grayish.  It works well, though.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen, it works and it is safer than what i have been using.</li>
            <li> Really, really dislike this stuff. It is super runny, has a slight off smell and is just gross to rub on your skin. No thank you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all! Shook up thoroughly but burned so so bad after little time and was reapplying often. What a waste and a painful lesson!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. Clean feel and works great. I&#x27;d buy this natural product again.</li>
            <li> Looking for a naturally sourced mineral sunscreen, I tried decided to try this - mostly because it was 8 oz. for a reasonable price, and I use sunscreen (&amp; reapply) daily in my job. It&#x27;s not terrible - it goes on super smooth, not sticky - but then it just sat on top of my skin ... could easily just wipe right off. So for some, this might not be an issue but I will be trying a new sunscreen next.</li>
            <li> Found this sunscreen to be all it advertised and better than I expected.  Feels good going on, easy to spread, and effective.  I bought it because I was looking for an effective sunscreen with a short non-toxic inactive ingredient list.  It leaves a hint of white on the skin, but I don&#x27;t worry about that.  It feels nice going on like it something that might actually be hydrating my skin.  I recommend it to friends because I have had nothing but good experiences with it.  Friends who I have let use it have been pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; application.  Additionally, the price point is pretty good for a non toxic sunscreen such as this one.</li>
            <li> Love the simple &amp; safe ingredient list! Works great for my kids&#x27; sensitive skin, and has protected us from burns all summer. Great price!</li>
            <li> It does the job as a sunscreen but it&#x27;s oiler than other sunscreens.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again as there are other options that are less greasy.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. A week in the Caribbean snorkeling and no sunburn. Goes on easy and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This is the only mineral sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look weird. It&#x27;s also one of the cheapest. A+</li>
            <li> What we really love about this product is the protection level. We wanted a mineral-based sunscreen, and this fit the bill perfectly - an affordable and totally reliable level of protection. The high level of zinc oxide really helps keep harmful rays out, and we put this on both ourselves and our kids without worry of it failing. The downside is that it is VERY thick, and extremely difficult to actually get into the skin - it&#x27;s very easy to apply too much, and that leaves your skin looking almost ashy white. Additionally, it can be oily if you get too hot and sweaty. We are going to keep using this product because we haven&#x27;t found the same level of protection in other products, but would like it if application was a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve tried every natural sunscreen on the market, and this is by far the best. No pasty coloration, no weird smells, it&#x27;s just a truly effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of mineral sunscreens and sure they prevent a burn but they do not make me look so great at the beach.  This sunscreen really works, it does not irritate my skin, it really goes on clear, and it stays effective for quite a long time.  I really appreciate this new sunscreen option and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a sunblock is like few others and that&#x27;s mostly a good thing from my perspective. It doesn&#x27;t contain nano-particle zinc oxide and it doesn&#x27;t have any active ingredients other than zinc oxide. The carrier is coconut oil and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell to it. It goes on easily and provided 80 minutes of sun protection in moderate to strong May sun in Florida when we were sunbathing as well as swimming. No tendency to stain clothing was noticed, although we did take the precaution of using towels over our leather car seats (just in case.) The only downside is that the resistance to washing off while swimming also means it is resistant to washing off when bathing after using the sunblock. We had to use a body wash mixed with Dawn dishwasher liquid to get this off and it usually takes two showers to get fully clean. Even after scrubbing with the soap/detergent mix, a fine layer of caked zinc oxide remains in the small creases of your skin. I suppose that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the assurance that you&#x27;re not getting suspect chemicals into your bloodstream, but be prepared to scrub!</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that the sunscreen is okay but if you are tan like myself or darker, be wary. It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen that leaves a white cast and it takes a lot to rub it in properly. You will have to put on a small amount at a time. Also if your hair is dark I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this on your hair. The smell is also mid-level, not too overwhelming but it still smells. Bottom line, if you are on a tight budget but still want a decent non-chemical sunscreen, get this one. But there are much better mineral sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> Being an Irish bloke, with medium cauliflower complexion, I have long been resigned to looking super kabuki whilst wearing various brands of mineral sunscreen. I was thus pleasantly surprised when I returned from the beach neither ghostly nor sunburnt. I hereby award this sunscreen 5 thumbs up. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and burn really easily. This past weekend at a 3 day outdoor music festival I had brought a non-natural 50spf water resistant sunscreen with me, but opted to try Neutral Skin and Hair Mineral Sunscreen when a friend offered it. I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, this comes out of the tube easily and has a thin enough consistency that it spreads on smoothly.  I found that I had no trouble with it being whitening or feeling like I had to rub it in more than I would with a non-natural sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some other reviewers have found the formula to be greasy, but I can&#x27;t say that was a problem for me.  Perhaps because I tend to have dry skin, I actually found it very moisturizing and pleasant.  I like that the carrier is coconut oil (something I keep around my house as a moisturizer and hair conditioner).  I found that while it felt a little greasy at first, after it had been on my skin for a couple of minutes, I did not feel greasy or sticky at all.  I also like that this product is fragrance free, none of that fake &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent that is in so many sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this sunscreen 3-4 times a day for the three full days of the festival, which was very sunny and warm, and didn&#x27;t burn at all! I never expected to make it out of that weekend with out at least a tiny bit of sunburn, and I&#x27;m really excited that I found a natural sunscreen that was able to protect my fair, sensitive skin in the most sunburn-y conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the coconut oil content, but preceded to buy because of high non-nano zinc content. I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of greasy sunscreens, but this one takes the cake! It was like slathering up with Crisco! It felt absolutely disgusting, but I waited it out, hoping that some of the oil would absorb (it never did-hours later, the thick layer of oil was still intact, along with all the hairs and bits of debris that it attracted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only one way I can conceive of this working for anyone-and that&#x27;s to use the tiniest, most imperceptible amount (which would render the SPF ineffective).</li>
            <li> Moisturizing with coconut oil base, also makes it smooth on well and disappears into skin after a little rubbing in. Exactly what I wanted with a No Chemical zinc oxide sunscreen that works right away when applied! Since its oil based it does not come off in water and skin looks moisturized but its not too oily. OK a lot of words to say I Love It and will reorder always so plse don&#x27;t discontinue!! xox</li>
            <li> Great beach product, not so much for daily use because it leaves a hint of white (the zinc) and a bit oily (coconut oil), but with that said it does fade and feel less oily after about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought for snorkeling in Hawaii (because of the product&#x27;s natural ingredients) to have as little affect on the living reefs.&lt;br /&gt;Applied 15 mins before going in the water and reapplied after, and it really worked as fare as coverage, so much so that I didn&#x27;t get much of a tan. Used on face too, didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for trips such as this.</li>
            <li> Great product , goes a long way ..much cheaper then buying once your over there.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is reasonably priced and rubs in great.  I do like it BUT its very greasy.  Because it is a natural sunscreen, I was hoping to also use on my face.  But, it really is best to use on your body only, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We live in a climate which is very harsh in terms of the sun&#x27;s impact. . .  New Mexico This product worked extremely well while hiking and skiing and I would recommend its performance on a number of levels.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2R8DGVS5C4X6U]]Rubs in really good. No streaks. Works well on kids. But I just wish it was in spray form for fastness. ps. I don&#x27;t get paid for my reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple formulation and a physical block rather than chemical sunscreen.  It effectively prevented both sunburn and suntan while we were at the beach for a few days, so I am confident it works.  The coconut oil formulation seems to also prevent the dry skin that can occur with so much sand, sun, and salt.  The water resistance is no joke, it stayed on in the water and in the shower unless scrubbed off with a washcloth.  Washing off with no soap but just the washcloth worked nicely to leave the skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy feeling, so if you are very intolerant of that, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  But that same greasiness is what kept our skin nice for the vacation.  My formerly intolerant-of-oil partner was completely won over and is ordering some for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a better sunscreen than this.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from chemical sunscreen (Neutragena) to this because I read about the dangers. I don&#x27;t get sunburned, so I&#x27;m using this mainly to avoid premature aging and skin cancer. I like this product. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. It goes on smoothly. It does leave a light, white tint on my skin. I don&#x27;t mind it, but I deducted 1 star for that. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it so far. Time will tell if it makes a difference or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light so you can apply easily on your skin. Simple ingredients and no weird scents!! Can be a bit greasy for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy feeling, so not ideal for everyday use. I like that it&#x27;s reef safe however.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of reef safe but I was not happy with this product. It left a white oily film on my skin. I will keep searching for an Eco friendly product that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze.</li>
            <li> The product was ok, however, bottle was not sealed, &amp; I only got a little over 1/2 bottle.  Dissappointed.  Don&#x27;t know if this bottle is used or not.  I am hopeful the product is what it claims to be...ie the ingredients are the Zinc Oxide, coconut oil etc.  Because the bottle was NOT sealed, don&#x27;t know if they put other stuff in it, or if the ingredients are truly what they say it is, plus the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> Gives me a little of that strange, ghosty hue, but it goes on MUCH easier than other mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I also love that the binder is coconut oil. No strange, nasty ingredients seeping into your pores.&lt;br /&gt;On top of it all, it is the best value of all I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> A bit oily and causes sand to stick on while playing beach sports.  Stays on well though uc applied and let dry.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy silky lotion, a little runny.  It goes on slightly white at first but then it soaks in and looks natural.  It does not irritate my eyes.  It can be a little drying so you need a good moisturizer underneath. It was still working hours later when I took a walk at the park though it&#x27;s best to reapply.</li>
            <li> I like that it is mineral based, I feel it provides good protection.  I also like that it is fragrance free, safe for the ocean, made in the USA, not tested on animals and reasonably priced - it is all around a great choice.  It does go on thick and is a bit shiny once applied, but I am ok with that for what it does, protect my kids skin!  I reapply if at the beach all day, otherwise for normal days and school I only apply once in the morning.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on clear. I have used it for running, so it seems sweat resistant. It is scent free, which is nice as I have sensitive skin. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on the beach this summer.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream that I would never put on my hair or my skin, did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this for our trip to Cancun.  We visited Xel-Ha, which is an ecological water park and I saw them inspecting people&#x27;s bag and removing their non-biodegradable sunscreen.  You do get it back when you leave but then you have to buy it at the park which is ~$15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked pretty well!  We applied it around noon and stayed until about 4pm.  We got a little color but did not burn...YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no bad odor or anything either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only worth bringing your own if you can find it for &amp;lt;$10, otherwise, just buy it at the park so you don&#x27;t have to worry about packing it and have it leak in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I always use sunscreen when I am going to spend a day on the beach and I always, ALWAYS, have a burn somewhere by the end of the day.  I used this product last weekend and it was fantastic.  I did not burn at all.  I was surprised at how well it disappeared into my skin.  Once I learned that a little bit of this product goes a long way I found it easy to rub in and didn&#x27;t have a problem with a white residue.  While it is true that it can feel mildly greasy I didn&#x27;t mind that at all. It left my skin feeling incredibly smooth and soft.  I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep data base and ordered it because of its positive environmental and health reviews as well as its affordability. The sunscreen rubs in well and does not leave white marks. It does leave your skin looking a bit oily but that shininess goes away after 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Needed a Biodegradable Sunscreen for Mexico vacation..  Goes on different than regular sunscreen but definately helps keep you from burning.. Doesnt come off easy in the water or with sweat.. Took some scrubbing in the shwoer to remove.. but works well</li>
            <li> I only use zinc oxide screens, and this one is rare in that it doesn&#x27;t leave a pale sheen on my face, so I can use it daily. My daughters hate some of the brands I&#x27;ve used on their face for being &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34;, but this one didn&#x27;t bother them!</li>
            <li> I have very pale, sensitive skin, so sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out/itch is a huge priority for me in the summer.  This is my favorite so far.  I have used it quite a few times without any irritation or breakouts, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a white residue as other mineral sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.  You may be able to see some white in the crease of my elbow, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable.  Application is easy--it&#x27;s thin so it spreads nicely.  It is also waterproof--you can actually see water beading off your skin, and it takes a bit of scrubbing to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, though, is that it is fairly greasy--you will be shiny.  I would not use this daily on my face. Some pressed powder cuts down on the shine, but it&#x27;s not a good base for makeup. I tried it under my CC cream for extra sun protection (CC cream is only SPF 15), with pressed powder, and it look good initially, but after a few hours in the sun it caused my makeup to look blotchy/clump in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it more for the beach or sitting outside in a casual setting (baseball games!) where you can joke about the lengths you must go to keep your pale skin from frying, not for walking to and from the office or something more formal where you want to wear more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the ease of application and the water resistance, I imagine it would also be really good for kids.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Wore it during a long summer month trekking through the Himalaya and did not burn once. Shared it with my trekking group and in no time everyone had abandoned their individual sunscreens and was asking if they could use some of mine. Rubs in nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave you ghost white like some either natural sunscreens.  Will definitely be buying more bottles for myself and family and friends.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen worked as stated need to reapply after 90 minutes but our bottle leaked and made a mess.</li>
            <li> If you use natural sunscreens you know that they aren&#x27;t the best when it comes to texture and application. This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s thin and smooth (unlike alba botanica and badger&#x27;s thick creams), but it still stays on for hours. It goes on clear with just the slightest hint of shimmer and protects your skin without any harmful ingredients! Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Sunblock rubs in fine with no white residue.  It doesn&#x27;t wear out in the water and provides phenomenal sun protection.  I wore it in the Caribbeans for 6 days and had no sunburn. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen a lot but it came to me exploded in the box.  Sunscreen was everywhere in the bag and some I&#x27;m the box.  Luckily I was sent another at no charge, but I do love how the sunscreen works!</li>
            <li> A good product for this price. I used it a few times at the end of summer and will continue using it next summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Simple ingredients--nothing suspicious&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply easily--it spreads out on my skin with a little gentle massage&lt;br /&gt;3) Fragrance free (I mean it doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell)--not something that I care about at all (one way or another), but I know a lot of people with allergy don&#x27;t like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;4) Seems to be effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether this is a good or bad thing, but everytime when I first apply it to my skin it feels warm as if my skin has been slightly warmed up with warm air. The warm feeling disappears within 5 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t feel irritated. I don&#x27;t like or dislike it, but think I would share anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Yes it does feel somewhat &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, as is the case for almost all the sun-screens I&#x27;ve tried on market, particularly the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; kinds. It is understandable but I&#x27;m still hoping to find non-toxic and non-greasy sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2) A little bit tricky to get the right amount from the bottle.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is one of my favorites among the mineral sunscreens because it is (relatively) inexpensive and goes on fairly clear.  It is very oil and therefore is not my first pick for my face.  Also, it seems like I have to put a lot on, so even though it is cheaper than  some of the other brands, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily seem like the best value, considering how much I have to apply.</li>
            <li> We loved how easily this sunscreen went on; especially compared to many barrier sunscreens we&#x27;ve used.  It seemed to work well for all of us. You do have to be diligent in reapplying it once you&#x27;ve been boogie boarding or body surfing where the ocean is pounding it off your body.  It didn&#x27;t work as well for our faces, for that reason. We use a Badger stick on our faces, in combination with this, and that seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Like many, I&#x27;m on the search for a really good physical sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave you white. Honestly, some of the reviews on this one made me question whether they were real or not, but I decided to take a chance. You get twice as much for less $ than many of the other options. The ingredients were all good without the red flags like oxybenzone and parabens. I took it to Florida and used it at the beach for the last week. Overall, I was very pleased. It isn&#x27;t thick like a lotion so it spreads easily. It goes on white, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a purple cast like some zinc oxide sunscreens do. It leaves a bit of a white cast, but I haven&#x27;t found a good one that disappears completely. It wasn&#x27;t so noticeable that I&#x27;d avoid using it. It didn&#x27;t leave big white marks on my suit like some do. The biggest negative for me was that it&#x27;s a little greasy. It has a bit of a gritty/dry feel to it when you spread it out so it doesn&#x27;t feel like oil, but it does leave your skin a bit shiny. I definitely had to wash my hands a couple of times after application before handling anything else. For now it&#x27;s my favorite that I&#x27;ve tried for a physical sunscreen on the body. I&#x27;m not good at reapplying so the fact that I tanned a little may be due to that. I definitely don&#x27;t look like I spent a week at the beach though so I&#x27;d say it works fairly well. As another mentioned, I did notice that it will run some (sweat or swimming) and tends to gather on the inside of my elbow. For what it&#x27;s worth, the reviewers who complain that it won&#x27;t blend in aren&#x27;t really doing themselves any favors by trying to rub it in. I read that the test that is done to come up with SPF ratings uses a layer of lotion that&#x27;s like icing on a cake. It&#x27;s a PHYSICAL block that isn&#x27;t supposed to be absorbed like chemical sunscreens. It is supposed to sit on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and pasty, the whole family loves it</li>
            <li> worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used....and yes I have used mineral sunscreen before. This does not stay on at all, doesn&#x27;t rub in, gets on cloths and ruins them.  Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen because it was a decent value (8 oz bottle for a little over $10) for a natural sunscreen. There are two issues I have with this sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is EXTREMELY greasy. After lathering up, my hands are so greasy that even washing them with soap and water doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;2. It seems to lack a certain amount of water resistance. I applied this lotion about 5-10 minutes before going surfing last week, and got really burnt. I was only out for about an hour, so I shouldn&#x27;t have needed to reapply, but apparently you really need to put this stuff on way before going in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone make a more informed decision. I will be trying out some other screens, and for the meantime sticking with my Alba Botanical sunscreen, which is more expensive but not greasy and more water resistant.</li>
            <li> Worded pretty good at the eco park in Mexico.  You just need to rub it in really well.  And it&#x27;s a bit on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen. It is easy to apply, rubs in well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face ghostly white. It is the least whitening of all the mineral sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried. I also appreciate that it is unscented just like it says. At first I thought it seemed expensive, but it is actually cheaper than similar brands.</li>
            <li> when i was a kid, i could never sit still for sunscreen applications because i have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens were too rough on my skin. over the years i&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect sunscreen that&#x27;s not too hard on my skin. most sunscreens that felt good contain chemicals that are absorbed through the skin which increases the risk of skin cancer. neutral skin and hair mineral sunscreen, however, feels unbelievably comfortable on my skin, and it uses natural ingredients. many natural cream formulas on the market are too clumpy, thus very difficult to get out of the tube. not so with this ss. it is easily accessible. lastly, it is impossible to beat the price given the quality of the product. i&#x27;ll recommend this to all my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m planning to take a vacation later this week, i&#x27;ll surely take this bad boy with me! haha</li>
            <li> Great sunblock that rates well on EWG.  Best price per ounce.  Love how moisturizing it feels because of the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product. It didn&#x27;t make my olive skin look white as some reviewers noted, although too much in one spot will make your skin feel greasy. I also didn&#x27;t burn after 3 hours in the sun (October sun in Ohio).    The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for that much was the scent. It&#x27;s not bad or strong compared to other sunscreens, but it&#x27;s something I just don&#x27;t want to smell like...</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever. I love it and it&#x27;s so nice. What a cute bottle</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my son and I at the beach and on the boat. Stays on even after swimming and neither of us have experienced sunburn while using it. We noticed that it does take some scrubbing to get it off in the shower, but the extra work is worth it. We&#x27;ve found the key to avoid the &amp;#34;ghost white&amp;#34; look when apply the sunscreen is to use small amounts for small areas at first. Then you can get used to how much sunscreen you&#x27;ll need to cover a certain amount of area.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Applies easily. Almost odorless. Plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I had to downgrade this to 2 stars from the original 3. My shoulders, chest and back have all burned while wearing this.  I might&#x27;ve attributed that to the unusually hot and sunny days this past week EXCEPT that I wore the remainder of my UV Naturals on my face yesterday while using this stuff on my shoulders, chest and back...and my face did NOT burn while the other areas did. And it&#x27;s not for lack of application as I have been slathering this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;But that leads me to the other issue- it really runs. After an hour or so I find white streaks and puddles on my arms and chest. It&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be repurchasing. Hoping the Thinksport line works better until UV Naturals comes back to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using UV Naturals for years, so when they discontinued U.S. distribution a few months ago, I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do for my sunblock needs. UV Naturals is now only available in 4 packs from Australia and I don&#x27;t have $150 at one time for sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to find  another natural mineral sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out, leave me pasty or bluish white, and would WORK. As a woman with melasma, a strong physical sunblock is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;After reading EWG&#x27;s latest reviews and scouring their recommendations on Amazon, the Neutral seemed like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;For one, it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost of the UV Naturals and you get nearly 2x as much. The ingredient list is oddly short, to the point it seemed almost lacking (no anti-oxidants, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;The first few days I thought this was pretty good. It&#x27;s so oily that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize before applying. And it only left the faintest bluish-white cast on my face and arms.&lt;br /&gt;However I found that after a short while outside, it starts to run. My arms in particular showed streaks, and the white pooled up in  creases in my skin.  I also found that my arms got tan despite slathering this on. I used to love to tan, but premature skin aging is real and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back. Went on a bike ride midafternoon for an hour or so, came home and slathered more on. Went back out on bike for another hour, this time around 5pm, when the sun was still shining but not so strong.&lt;br /&gt;Came home, showered (you do have to scrub this stuff off), and found my chest was pink, my arms brown and my upper back is burnt. Burnt burnt, not just rosy. My face is somewhat red but I had a helmet with a visor, so was a bit more protected.&lt;br /&gt;When using the UV Naturals, I often would apply it, go out for a 10 mile walk in the afternoon without ever reapplyng, and my skin would still have almost no color afterwards. I reapplied Neutral after just a couple hours, wasn&#x27;t even in the sun as long as I usually am, and I STILL got burnt. :(&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an effective sunblock until I can afford that 4 pack of UV Naturals from Australia.real and it ain&#x27;t pretty, so I&#x27;d prefer to avoid getting any more sun damage than I already have.&lt;br /&gt;But today made it clear that this sunscreen was not going to cut it: I slathered it all over my face, neck, arms, shoulders and upper back.

            <li> I love that this is natural and safe for lakes/oceans. So many sunscreens are linked to cancer, but not this one because it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin. It does look white when you put it on, but I didn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s healthier. It&#x27;s very hard to wash off though! And feels pretty sticky. I didn&#x27;t get burned very much when I used it for vacation in Mexico. I didn&#x27;t reapply it as much as I was supposed to though.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for as well as I had hoped. I was looking for a safe sunscreen for the whole family that wouldn&#x27;t leave us all looking pasty, and this seemed like it would be great because as other reviewers had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit oily helping it spread very nicely. The only problem is that is just sits on the skin and never really absorbs, so you are just very oily the entire time. Not to mention that I feel like we all still got a lot of color while wearing this sunscreen, which leads me to believe that it&#x27;s not creating a very good barrier. Can&#x27;t recommend it. Gonna have to try and find something new again...Ugh, what a bummer.</li>
            <li> I love this biodegradable spf lotion! It leaves a tint of a blueish/ purpleish if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in very well, but that is avoidable by using a little at a time on each area of your body. It does not have a smell, which is better than another brand that  i bought that smells fishy!! I totally recommend for daily use, or if you need it for vacation to a spot that only allows biodegradable lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves a oily film but its all natural and is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Today it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that isn&#x27;t jam packed with harmful chemicals. Who wants to soak up some oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate through their sensitive facial pores? I don&#x27;t! That&#x27;s why I use this sunscreen. It contains coconut oil and other safe ingredients. It&#x27;s worry free! Chemical free! AND it&#x27;s the cheapest sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t contain cancer causing chemicals!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, as the ingredient list is safe and others recommended it.  However, it is so white and thick; I can never seem to blend it in.  It&#x27;s also pretty greasy.  Am still on the hunt for a mineral sunscreen that works for me!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was way too greasy.  I put it on my son before heading to the beach, and within moments of arriving (20 minutes later) he was covered with sand that was stuck to his still wet skin.  The sunscreen never soaked in and remained wet and sticky.  Both my kids hate it so it&#x27;s going in the trash.  Total waste.</li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews, and the good rating on EWG, I wanted to love this product. It works well enough (though my husband says he got burned wearing it, I thought coverage was fine) and I like that it&#x27;s better for me and the environment, but this product is incredibly oily. I used it when we were out canoeing, wearing active clothes and the oil was so bad that the clothes now have spots that won&#x27;t come out in the wash. So, I guess it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t care about oil spots on your clothes, but I will not be purchasing it again. This sunscreen is cheaper for the amount (which also made me want to love it) but once you factor in the damaged clothing, it costs a lot more...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I realized that my previous product dissolved the nail polish on my hands and feet. I bought this product to use on my hands and feet in order to eliminate that problem. I like the consistency of the product and it rubs in so there are no white markings on my hands and feet. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> I wore this mineral sunscreen today for one of the first sunny days here in Michigan. When I tried it on, I noticed it was odorless, and did not whiten my skin. And no sun burns!</li>
            <li> I got this after having a sunburnt scalp one day.  I&#x27;m losing more hair than I thought I was.  Anyway, this stuff is white - it&#x27;s like regular sunscreen. Why say it&#x27;s for hair???  There&#x27;s nothing different about it and other white cream sunscreens there.  I thought it would be some kind of sun-protective oil.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I bought it for our family snorkeling trip and was so pleased with the quality. It felt very oily when first put on. But if you read the ingredients, the oil is from natural coconut oil and it can be absorbed by skin. Regardless of the salt water, my face felt soft and moist by the end of the day because of the coconut oil.  To avoid the ghostly look, we did apply the sunscreen about 30 minutes before we got into the water.</li>
            <li> i really like this sunscreen. You only need very little of it as it is slightly greasy when you first apply but it gets absorbed into the skin very quickly. I like the coconut smell as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for a while.  It is oily but works well.  As with all sunscreens, re-apply.</li>
            <li> Possibly a bit runnier than the last bottle.  A plus- it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> This makes me so white the sun has to put on sun glasses.</li>
            <li> Goes on without a film, unlike other natural sunblocks.  Works good too.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have dangerous chemicals or micro ingridients, but it&#x27;s super thick and you need a lot for a small area. I try to add lotion or oils to it to make it easier to spread, but that may make it less effective . I&#x27;m using it for when I go swimming now as opposed to every day.</li>
            <li> Too greasy. Too oily for face that I got pimples.  i will not buy it again. I don&#x27;t even know what to do with this large bottle. it&#x27;s hard to find sunscreen without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face. It feels slightly oily when I first put it on, but after a minute that greasiness disappear and my face feels great. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it is not causing black heads or acne so far. I would recommend it to people who&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on vacation soon and plan on doing some snorkeling.  I was told I should purchase a reef safe sunscreen.  However, when I did my research most of the reef safe sunscreens tend to leave a ghostly white tint and being a black woman, with a medium chocolate complexion, I was desperately trying to avoid looking like Casper.  When I read that this product would dry clear I decided to give it a try.  I am happy to report that it does dry clear with only a hint of a whitish tint and one would have to look really hard, which I was doing, to notice that it was there.  I cannot report on how well it works as a sunscreen but when I find out I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (unlike most sunscreens that contain zinc oxide), nice smell and protects well ( the after just beads up on the skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy but otherwise fine. I do have rather dry skin so for those with oily or normal skin should keep that in mind when purchasing. Probably won&#x27;t get this again, however the price was very good.</li>
            <li> Works great - but you MUST reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> only shows up white if you use a ton and you don&#x27;t really need a ton.  works great. used it in direct sun in mexico for an entire week, diving, snorkeling, swimming. don&#x27;t need much to get great coverage--a little goes a long way. reapply every hour and a half to two hours, which you should be doing anyway.  great price considering how long it lasts.  definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have Dark Patches on My Face Due to Sun Damage by UVB&lt;br /&gt; &amp; UVA rays and was advised by My Physician to use an SPF product with SPF  content of More than 30% Whoch  has Zinc and titanium Dioxide.When I saw this Product has all. The Qualities I was so much Exited and bought the Product.&lt;br /&gt;However When I used this product on my Face it gave me a white layer on my face. Hence I could not. Continue using this Product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this sunscreen, as it is far too greasy.  I have been using California Baby and Blue Lizard products, which are thick and pasty white.  I was hoping this would be a solution, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really leave the white residue that is common with mineral sunscreens, and rubs in easy. I like it! Especially for the price! Most importantly it does the job and we haven&#x27;t burned while using it, even after 2+ hours at the splash pad and pool.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients. Goes on slightly white and chalky. Need to rub in well.</li>
            <li> too white on  my skin</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this particular sunscreen.  BUT for the price and amount it is very good deal.  It is little bit on the watery side and leave white residue that are difficult to remove but that is typical of all natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This is thick sunscreen and is a bit hard to get off, but works very well and contains no nasty chemicals</li>
            <li> We live in South Florida and spend most of the time outside in direct sun. My husband runs his charter fishing company and it has been tough to find a good sunscreen that would work for him (his complexion is really fair) as well as the environment. After reading the reviews here I ordered this product and must say - this has proven to be one of the best sunscreens we have ever used for this price! The product says it is water resistant for 80 mins but even after a full day of spearfishing we reapply only once and have no problem at all. Some people say it makes them look a little ghostly, which can be true, but only until if you apply a thicker layer. Also I have noticed that it works better for me if I apply it about 15 mins before getting out. By that time most of the ghostly look disappears and I feel that the protection gets even better when it has time to set in. As some mentioned it is harder to wash this product off even with soap but we are ok with it. In my opinion that is a really small price for the overall results and the fact that it is not harmful to the environment..</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my children, 9 and 5. I don&#x27;t like chemical sunscreen, so I was thrilled to find this natural product at a reasonable price.  This product covers well and is leaves your skin soft from the coconut oil.  It does take a little longer to rub in but it is worth the time to be able to use a safe product.  We have used this several times and it has worked well.  Be sure and follow the directions on how often to apply this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is JUNK!!! It may be good for the fishies, but it is LOUSY for protecting people from the sun. I looked like a snowman after putting tons of it on, let it sit like the directions said, and this stuff FLOWED off all of us as soon as we hit the water! You could actually see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I you like paying good money for no results, you&#x27;ll love this crapola...</li>
            <li> Great EWG rating which is why I purchased but.... It smells a lot and it made my boyfriend purple!&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting another sunscreen later...</li>
            <li> Bottle came half empty!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great!!! It has very good ingredients and does not make your skin look too white (just make sure to rub it in as well as as possible since it has zinc as an active ingredient). I am totally satisfied with the results. Plus it keeps the skin moisturized. I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen costs just a little more than half of what I&#x27;ve paid for other types of sunblock.  I&#x27;m not used to mineral sunscreen and at first I noticed that this feels different on your skin than other sunscreens - but quickly I grew to like the way Neutral left my skin feeling.  I also love that it *really is* fragrance free - it works very well yet it won&#x27;t make you smell like... sunblock.  Well done, Neutral Skin &amp; Hair!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of natural sunscreens I opted for this.  It did not leave the white residue on the skin and protected against the sun very well.  In fact, there was one spot I overlooked when applying, and this is the ONLY spot that got sunburned.  My only negative would be that it did leave the skin feeling and looking greasy.  But I will take that over white skin!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised. It feels nicer than any mineral sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t too white or too thick. It also seemed to provide adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li> Worked great for snorkeling, dolphins and all in Cancun!</li>
            <li> BEST EVER, never buying anything else, so happy I want to shout it from the mountain tops!!!!  As a mom of 2 kids, we are trying to remove unnecessary chemicals, fillers from our food/skin products etc.  After looking at the ewg.org (website rating safety of each ingredient in products), we tried this GREAT PRICED MINERAL SUNBLOCK--it has just a few, recognizable ingredients.  Just used it in FL for 14days--not a single person is even slighted tanned!  No sunburn, Just reapply ever 1.5-2 hours (standard).  We will never buy anything else--and, it spreads on really well so the bottle lasts FOREVER, even on large amounts of adult skin.  Safe for reefs, safe for people, something to really feel good about bringing into your home.  BUY THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> It went on well but did not give enough protection.  I did burn a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered.  I like using a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Living in FL, we use this regularly in our household. I like that this product is safe for the family, there is no discernible fragrance, and it works! It does leave a slight whitish hue when you first apply it, but I notice if you rub it in well and wait the recommended 15 minutes,  it goes away. This product is an awesome value. You get so much more product for the price compared to other natural sunscreens. I didn&#x27;t experience this product to be overly oily. In the sun, it does seem to melt the oils, perhaps making some feel like it&#x27;s overly oily. For me, it wasn&#x27;t an issue, and it covers more surface area that way.  I would recommend this product to anyone who want natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Claim that it doesn&#x27;t make you all white is absolutely bogus</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Leaves the faintest of white on skin. But I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I wore this sunscreen all week on vacation in Florida and did not get burned. Great sun protection. It is quite thick though and needs some exfoliation in the shower to get it all off.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff last year while trying to find healthier sunscreen alternatives for my family. For the price you do get a good amount, so it is very cost effective. My family goes to a lot of festivals and are very active, spending lots of times outside. I needed something effective and versatile for my toddler, my older kiddo, my hubby and me. Now I am probably the pickiest, and I use sunblock daily. I wear it on my face, neck, shoulders and arms every time I leave the house (aging concerns and all that). This stuff is STICKY!!! It is also really greasy. I immediately discovered I can&#x27;t use it on my sensitive face and neck. Using it on my arms meant sticky greasy residue on my clothing - so daily use for me was out. For festivals - talk about a dirt magnet. And after a few applications, I felt like my skin was suffocating. Wearing it to the beach (where clothing and dirt aren&#x27;t a care) turned me into walking sandpaper. The kids didn&#x27;t mind - and they never had any reactions to it. It seemed to be effective, and I still have a half a bottle left, but I wish it was gone. I am sure there are applications in which it would be great (snorkeling - hence the &#x27;reef friendly&#x27; label), but I am going back to the not-as-natural Alba Botanicals ones until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I liked this sunscreen, and thought it was a good value based on the size. Four other people were using this, but for some reason, when I used it it didn&#x27;t absorb well, and I was covered in white goop! I didn&#x27;t care, but it was pretty funny. No one else had this problem, so maybe I was using too much, or maybe my skin has different absorbtion issues!! Regardless - it worked - I did not burn.</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen, I wish there were more of these products on the shelves locally. It feels great and satisfies my needs of not bathing in something toxic to protect myself</li>
            <li> Good natural sunscreen with a great EWG rating! It does have a strange greasy feeling at first, but it does fade after some time. Part of my bottle leaked out during shipment since it arrived in just a bubble mailer, which was disappointing. But otherwise a nice product worth repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a spray (like hairspray) since I bought this for my hair. I would not put sunscreen lotion on my hair. Yuck.. Also&lt;br /&gt;product arrived with the bottle part way opened and sunscreen all over this place.  I sent it back promptly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not consistently good with putting on sunscreen.  I have recently learned the difference between mineral and chemical based sunscreens, and decided if I am going to put something on myself and children, it should be the least harmful.  Then I read about the purple effects most zinc-based sunscreens create.  Not really crazy about the sunscreen to begin with and definitely not wanting to look a touch of purple, I continued my search.  I stumbled on these and based on reviews and the promise to go on clear without the extra greasy feel, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t put it on as often as I should, so I can attest to how well it keeps one from burning (for me, my strategy is stay in the shade, wear a hat, and limit how long I&#x27;m in the sun).  However, the times I did put it on, it kept its promise to not be purple or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit confused about the brand name and to try to find other products offered, but this seems to be it.</li>
            <li> Tested on Mom, Dad and two kids for two weeks solid on very sunny beach. It goes on smooth. It stays on in salt water. It has the safest ingredients. It is by far the best I have ever tried. Not cakey at all. I am trusting it for use on my husband during the blazing hot, side of the highway construction season. This product does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty safe from the ingredients list, but it is pretty difficult to spread well and you will end up a shade or two lighter wherever you put it on.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen all summer and never got burned (although I try not to spend a ton of time in direct sunlight anyway). I noticed sometimes it would collect in the crease of my elbow, but generally it rubbed in and stayed put. It didn&#x27;t get on my clothes, and it didn&#x27;t wash off easily because of the beeswax. I used it regularly on my face and it didn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Compared to other natural sunscreens, this one is well-priced and has actually recognizable ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you mix it into your skin well it isn&#x27;t super noticeable however it does make you oily, because the sunscreen is designed to sit on your skin all day. This can be an issue when it&#x27;s on your hands, face etc. However, it&#x27;s worth not having to use toxic sunscreen and is overall an effective product I use everyday</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well--i have very fair skin and burn easily, and I did not get sunburned while wearing this sunscreen. It goes on a little chalky but it rubs out easily. It is much less chalky than other mineral sunscreens I have tried. I recommend this sunscreen and will be ordering more for next summer!</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen - No sunburn - No weird smell - Very oily - It spreads on smoothly - Really good for the price - Highly recommended by EWG - I recommend!</li>
