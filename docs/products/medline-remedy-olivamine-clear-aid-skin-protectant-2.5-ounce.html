            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase and would buy again in the future if needed.</li>
            <li>and ha ha got all chapped until I went to DC/NY and experienced a humid summer (I live in Arizona, and it really is a dry heat - 85 in DC/NY</li>
            <li>This ointment cleared it up right away.  </li>
            <li>mild enough works like magic</li>
            <li>best protection ever, my baby is supper sensitive and as long as I use this, and not even on every diaper change, but 2-3 times daily, she doesn&#x27;t get any rashes or anything.</li>
            <li>It helped heal my skin and worked very fast.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li>I learned about these products in care-giving classes and they really knew what they were talking about!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on a surgical incision once the staples were removed and even the doctor was surprised at how well - and how quickly - the scar faded to a minimum.</li>
            <li>That being said, it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>We are very please with how well this works.</li>
            <li>and it protects the ski very well.  </li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job protecting the skin and allowing it to heal - especially in a moisture-rich environment.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really protects the skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly kinda like a gentle vanilla.</li>
            <li>and she says it works very well for her.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams, ointments, and emollients but only this one has worked wonders for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now our go to over a year later, even for mild irration.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I swear this stuff is magic in a little tube!</li>
            <li>this ointment works very well for newborn with diaper rash due to heavy diarrhea, highly recommend and better yet to check with doctors as well before apply it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Clear Aid.</li>
            <li>Having had eczema and dry sensitive skin since childhood,I have tried many products for dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li>If you have chapped hands that do not seem to get better after you try one product after another, I would recommend at least trying Clear Aid Ointment Remedy.</li>
            <li>but nurses told us about another cream which wasn&#x27;t clear (Zinc oxide in it).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a budget version of this, just use vaseline... or old tubes of chapstick you might have laying around...</li>
            <li>Our baby developed alergy to another one.</li>
            <li>My daughter from birth has been re-use of this, the original well used, but this time to buy and not the same as previously,</li>
            <li>We was my mom several times a day and always use Nutrashield or Clear Aid to keep her from chafing.  </li>
            <li>Healing is so much faster than other products.</li>
            <li>Now I use it on any area where my skin is thin and easily irritated such as my tail bone.  </li>
            <li>I found that this ointment is very thick and the ointment tube needs to be warmed just a little in warm water to help with ease of application.  </li>
            <li>If anyone is stuck sitting or lying down for too long this will protect you from bedsores for certain.  </li>

            <li> This skin product is very useful for protecting skin that is prone to become wet or at least damp.  </li>
            <li> a strange side note</li>
            <li> Due to our baby&#x27;s Leukemia treatment we now use it daily to protect her skin and help heal.</li>
            <li> Living in Las Vegas means dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything on my dry feet, this product has cured the problem.  </li>
            <li> This product soothes dry and sun burned skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin or hands are in water a lot.</li>
            <li> If it gets wet it turns into slime on your hands.  </li>
            <li> I have bought numerous products that almost work but destroy his socks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of annoying</li>
            <li> This product gives a thick layer of protective ointment that does not absorb as fast as just plain vaseline.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so</li>
            <li> My hands are dry and rough because of the harsh chemical cleaning solvents we use in the hospital fir surgical procedures.</li>
            <li> One daughter like it for babies bottom other daughter does not see results.</li>
            <li> I got it the other day and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When my son was teething, he would have battery-acid-like bowel movements that would give him screaming red bleeding rashes almost instantly, this stuff would clear up the rash anywhere from overnight to a day or two depending on how bad it was.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like using desitin or those thick white creams</li>
            <li> It calms down irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought this previously and it did not have that in it?</li>
            <li> Clear Aid Ointment Remedy is difficult to recommend for all potentiial customers.</li>
            <li> But all babies eat different that can cause rashes worse then others........</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few days.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few things on this earth that has helped heal my fingers that are exposed to the harsh weather.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this product is that it is not easily found (Amazon has been the only place I can find it...).</li>
            <li> This was given to us when our son was hospitalized when he was an infant because he had some pretty bad diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> even though it is a small tube, it lasts me a while.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is causing it.</li>
            <li> take a small bit of the chap stick, rub in your hands and apply.  </li>
            <li> Also used to alleviate irritated skin on long term (in bed) ill person.</li>
            <li> Once again I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but it has a hard granular substance in it.</li>
            <li> and yet I hate it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It feels gritty, oily, and just nasty when you put it on until it drys.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that heals by baby&#x27;s horrible diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> Have yet to meet a bad Remedy product.  </li>
            <li> My husbands feet crack something awful in the winter.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The hospital used this product when he was in ICU.  I decided if it was god for him then it would be good for him now and it is.We are very please with how well this works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. I had a rash that had gotten severely burned by steroid cream, and this was the ONLY thing that helped it heal. Saw results in a few days.</li>
            <li> An excellent cream to protect very sensitive skin. It has multiple usage. It helps diaper rash. It calms down irritated skin.</li>
            <li> We were introduced by this product in the NICU and ordered more when we took our baby home. I&#x27;ve tried several brands of diaper creams but the Medline is the best when it comes to any skin irritation on the baby.  I&#x27;ve also used it for my dish pan hands from cleaning bottles and it works wonders.  It smells nice too. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have yet to meet a bad Remedy product.  We was my mom several times a day and always use Nutrashield or Clear Aid to keep her from chafing.  This is a great product</li>
            <li> Medline Products are the best!  They help to keep my mother bedsore and diaper rash free.  They promote healthy skin.  I learned about these products in care-giving classes and they really knew what they were talking about!  Thank you Medline!</li>
            <li> Great for my butt!!! I am in a wheelchair, and this product keeps my pressure sores from bleeding.</li>
            <li> This product is one of those I love it and yet I hate it at the same time.  It feels gritty, oily, and just nasty when you put it on until it drys.  If it gets wet it turns into slime on your hands.  With all that said though it does what it claims and more!  This product is one of the few things on this earth that has helped heal my fingers that are exposed to the harsh weather.  I have tried many different creams, ointments, and emollients but only this one has worked wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a strange side note this product works AWESOME to help heal bed soars and is highly recommended by my wife who had to use it, her doctor, and the local hospital to help heal them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for diaper rashes!</li>
            <li> My Dad loves how great this cream lubricates the privates and keeps things moist without the smell of Desitin or the A &amp; D ointment!  But you can never beat the vanilla smell of a nice fresh tube of Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste!</li>
            <li> I found out about this product because they use this in the NICU at the hospital where my daughter was born.  This is just an excellent product. There is a light smell which is very pleasant and it protects the ski very well.  This replaced all the baby diaper creams for me.</li>
            <li> I am RN. My hands are dry and rough because of the harsh chemical cleaning solvents we use in the hospital fir surgical procedures. This solves the problem. Its thick and oily but my hands absorbs it perfectly. A little goes a long way. I am familiar with this product because we use it for wound care prevention.</li>
            <li> I found that this ointment is very thick and the ointment tube needs to be warmed just a little in warm water to help with ease of application.  The ointment is a nice protective coating for the skin.</li>
            <li> My husbands feet crack something awful in the winter.  I have bought numerous products that almost work but destroy his socks.  The hospital used this on bed sores  on my Mother so I sought it out on line.  Works excellent, he is very pleased and I am not replacing socks.  It&#x27;s not greasy and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This product gives a thick layer of protective ointment that does not absorb as fast as just plain vaseline.  This is the only product that heals by baby&#x27;s horrible diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with order!</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job protecting the skin and allowing it to heal - especially in a moisture-rich environment.  I&#x27;ve also used it on a surgical incision once the staples were removed and even the doctor was surprised at how well - and how quickly - the scar faded to a minimum.</li>
            <li> My baby recently had a rash and I don&#x27;t like using desitin or those thick white creams, this is ideal and has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li> Having had eczema and dry sensitive skin since childhood,I have tried many products for dry cracked skin. I was introduced to this during a recent hospital stay. It helped heal my skin and worked very fast. A little goes a long way so even though it is a small tube, it lasts me a while. Great for my feet, elbows and knees. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would buy again in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a nurse recommended this to me. I got it the other day and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;This distrbutor was also prompt and easy to do business with.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it all the time on my kids bottoms when they have rashes and they go away within a changing. Shipment was very fast. I got my package in like 2 days. Was very pleased with  this seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff really protects the skin.  It was a lifesaver for my mother in the hospital in critical condition for over six months.  Now I use it on any area where my skin is thin and easily irritated such as my tail bone.  If anyone is stuck sitting or lying down for too long this will protect you from bedsores for certain.  It smells heavenly kinda like a gentle vanilla.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for a variety of reasons.  I even bought a tube for my daughter and her newborn.  So much better than the zinc oxide products.  It clears it up immediately.  Great for calluses and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> This was given to us when our son was hospitalized when he was an infant because he had some pretty bad diaper rash.  This ointment cleared it up right away.  It&#x27;s now our go to over a year later, even for mild irration.  It has a light refreshing scent which I enjoy.  Two thumbs up for this product!  I only buy this for my kids&#x27; tushes!</li>
            <li> This is another great mediline product for diaper rash. Once again I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but it has a hard granular substance in it. I have bought this previously and it did not have that in it? I am not sure what is causing it. I don&#x27;t know if it has been stored in the heat before I purchased it or what. Once again I just apply the paste and pick off the gritty grains. It&#x27;s kind of annoying but the product works so great that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  In my life, I&#x27;ve never had issues where the area between my hoo hoo and ha ha got all chapped until I went to DC/NY and experienced a humid summer (I live in Arizona, and it really is a dry heat - 85 in DC/NY is like 105-100 in Phoenix).  So, I searched around and ordered this and it was fantastic and I was all healed up in a jiffy.  It smells nice.  If you&#x27;re looking for a budget version of this, just use vaseline... or old tubes of chapstick you might have laying around... take a small bit of the chap stick, rub in your hands and apply.  That&#x27;s what I did until this arrived and it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone else and she says it works very well for her. We will be buying more as needed.</li>
            <li> This skin product is very useful for protecting skin that is prone to become wet or at least damp.  n</li>
            <li> I order this product on a regular basis for my mother because she loves this skin care product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an elder she loves it plus it works for diaper rash on babies mild enough works like magic</li>
            <li> They were using this in the hospital but nurses told us about another cream which wasn&#x27;t clear (Zinc oxide in it). Our baby developed alergy to another one. Eventually I found this cream online and turned out that it is the best for our baby.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Clear Aid. Sores healed within 2 days. Healing is so much faster than other products. The hospital used it on my husband for tape sores &amp; they healed quickly!</li>
            <li> Great on very dry cracked skin around finger tips. Also used to alleviate irritated skin on long term (in bed) ill person. Learned of this product initially at hospital.</li>
