            <li> The part is realistic, although it does require a little touch of foundation or concealer.  </li>
            <li> It is long, about 20 inches.</li>
            <li> I am going to order another one so that I can have a long one and a bob cut one.</li>
            <li> but not least, This wig tangled SO bad SO damn quick</li>
            <li> I had to do a little work to it because it was too long for me.  </li>
            <li> The lace portion is much less than I prefer, about an inch.</li>
            <li> but it is a little snug on snug on the head.</li>
            <li> My other wigs I would rock everyday and didn&#x27;t have to apply any heat for about 1-2 months!</li>
            <li> And if you have a big head, the hair maybe too thin for you.</li>
            <li> A little trick I&#x27;ve learned over the years is to apply a small amount of leave in moisturizer to prevent frizzing and tangling.</li>
            <li> It is way too small.</li>
            <li> You have to leave hair down in the back because it looks horrible if parted in the back.(I have wigs that are NOT full lace</li>
            <li> I am a serious wig wearer.</li>
            <li> But the bad definitely out weighs the situation.</li>
            <li> And it makes the wig part look weird.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t express how disappointed I was in this wig.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll stick with Freetress and Sensationnel, they never did me wrong!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing wigs since 2010 &amp; this was the WORST one that I&#x27;ve had in my collection!</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATED the fact that I can NOT wear the wig on my sides!</li>

            <li> Quality is good. I dont like the part , or the color. I got 1b3330 or something like that. But that was my gamble. The part is not realistic at all, I had to work with it to make it more natural.</li>
            <li> I love zenn~! She holds up very well. nice and full. I get so many compliments on her daily!</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely beautiful I love how it naturally flips back into layers when you run your fingers through it but it is a little snug on snug on the head. I will be purchasing again very soon because it looks natural and nice.</li>
            <li> I love Zenn. Ooohhh my God .I&#x27;m  in love with ZennðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> Color looked a bit different, however I received many compliments on this wig. The lace portion is much less than I prefer, about an inch. 😳&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> Loved this wig ! still have it until this day tangle free, and not shiny...it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> Love the wig. Im usually a solid color type of girl but this dark root fade to blonde is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing wigs since 2010 &amp; this was the WORST one that I&#x27;ve had in my collection! The only good thing about this wig is the color! I adore the color and it looks sooo good with my skin. But the bad definitely out weighs the situation. Lol. I don&#x27;t like the cap construction. It is way too small. It feels like the wig can slide off my head at any point because it&#x27;s so tight/small, even with the combs and all. I absolutely HATED the fact that I can NOT wear the wig on my sides! You have to leave hair down in the back because it looks horrible if parted in the back.(I have wigs that are NOT full lace and I can split the hair in the back and it looks fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, This wig tangled SO bad SO damn quick, it blew my damn mind! My other wigs I would rock everyday and didn&#x27;t have to apply any heat for about 1-2 months! I wore this wig a totally of 3 times for about 1-3 hours each time. The second time wearing it, it was already tangled and getting matted!! Of course I can add heat to it but I shouldn&#x27;t have to that soon! Words can&#x27;t express how disappointed I was in this wig. I searched high and low for it on top of that. It looks good but child, looks can be deceiving. I&#x27;m going to do something with it tho because I&#x27;m GOING to get my money&#x27;s worth honey! Lol. But this made me not want to try Outre ever again! Guess I&#x27;ll stick with Freetress and Sensationnel, they never did me wrong!! Lol.</li>
            <li> There are no bad things to say about this wig it is awesome on soooo many levels! you can look like an instant movie star in no time with this piece! and the colors were soooo  beautiful</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was sooo fast. It took only about 3 days to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the wig is beautiful too. Only thing is the lace turns into a skin cap. And it makes the wig part look weird. I&#x27;d rather it been just a skin cap or just lace. And if you have a big head, the hair maybe too thin for you. I&#x27;m thinking about adding more pieces to it. Great wig and company to purchase from though. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had to do a little work to it because it was too long for me.  This has saved me soooo much money because I was buying new units every tow weeks.  It last FOREVER and looks so natural.  Very comfortable and light.  Perfect for Summer.</li>
            <li> I cut this wig in to a bob.  It was lovely. :)  the color is good.  I&#x27;m a NW46 in mac cosmetics</li>
            <li> I am a serious wig wearer. I wear them 24/7 . Zenn is by far my favorite thus far. The part is realistic, although it does require a little touch of foundation or concealer.  The curls hold fairly well but do require some additional styling  by about week 2. This is never a problem because it also takes to heat nicely. A little trick I&#x27;ve learned over the years is to apply a small amount of leave in moisturizer to prevent frizzing and tangling.</li>
            <li> Great wig. Beautiful layers and the ombré is to die for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lace front wig. I just got it and I have got to order another one to have as a back up. It&#x27;s soft and the length is just the way I like. Be sure to tweeze the part and put concealer in the part for a more natural look. I received my wig very quickly after I placed the order which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this hair so much gave it to my sister</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I love this wig! The DR30 color is the bomb.com... It has 2 combs on the side and one in the back, as well as a strap. Some people complained that the cap was small, but I have a small head, so it fits me perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t look wiggish. The hair is a nice texture. I did put some concealer on the part, so that it would look more natural. The part on this wig looks greyish, but a little makeup made it 10 times better. If anybody is thinking of a wig, this is the one. I received many compliments on it. It looks totally natural. It is long, about 20 inches. I am going to order another one so that I can have a long one and a bob cut one. ENJOY!</li>
