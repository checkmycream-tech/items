            <li>All and all great!  </li>
            <li>DO NOT be a naïve person like me and thing it will create a beautiful mist of olive oil for your husband&#x27;s grilling adventures.</li>

            <li>I love this bottle.  </li>
            <li>I used these with essential oils to make non toxic cleaners and the spray bottle works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size and only takes a couple sprays!</li>
            <li>Would have ordered more in my shipment so I didn&#x27;t pay more shipping again.</li>
            <li>OF THESE ITEMS, FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>and I probably did not use it more than six times.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m most upset because the picture shows three bottles.</li>
            <li>However, the most important part of a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle is the ability to &amp;#34;spray.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I recieved the pink one LOL!</li>
            <li>AL part is fine but the sprayer is junk.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for their little hands to hold and operate.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted a spray bottle that looks good and the other ones, that are plastic, don&#x27;t look as nice.</li>
            <li>Functional and useful!</li>
            <li>Works great as long as you&#x27;re not picky about the color.  </li>
            <li>It was great for a few days, when the top cover fell off the pump.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice metal spray bottle and pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>very pretty bottle</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and mine has not broken on me.</li>
            <li>Right now the sprayer isn&#x27;t of any use to me at all.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to make sure that it was clear since three bottles are pictured, even though I know it was my own mistake mixing up this product with other spray bottles that do come in packs of three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the listing is very VERY misleading.</li>
            <li>so if there is any fluid in the bottle it should be able to reach it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for stainless to work out!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have paid this much for one bottle!</li>
            <li>wouldnt spray the first time I tried to use it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The canister is pretty though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, had no idea which color</li>
            <li>This is your classic aluminum spray bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>very disapointed i thought it was all 3</li>
            <li>i was getting for that much</li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the box, the nozzle didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get much spray with each pump.</li>
            <li>it was cheap enough</li>
            <li>I was mislead by the picture and thought I would be getting three instead of one, but that was more due to my lack of reading.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this order, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>, I would still not expect it to break after only using it a hand full of times spraying</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;IS A HIGH RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS</li>
            <li>I love that the tubing is extra long</li>
            <li>First of all, only one bottle comes.</li>
            <li>They are small spray bottles but that is fine because I don&#x27;t need that much water to mist plants.</li>
            <li>the spayer is very flimsy and cheap and broke after very little use.  </li>
            <li>I made homemade non-toxic clear for my kids to help with the wiping and cleaning of surfaces.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to hold homemade bottom-cleaning spray for my one year old.  </li>
            <li>It was still usable for a couple of weeks, and then the pump was completely done.  </li>
            <li>All in all, not worth the $5 for the limited number of times I was able to use it.</li>
            <li>Definitely NOT  worth the high price!!!</li>
            <li>I take the blame for that because clearly I didn&#x27;t read the description properly.</li>
            <li>Works for my essential oil solutions without a problem thus far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend buying some of the other spray bottles on here that are only a few dollars more for a pack of three.</li>
            <li>Although this bottle may have been originally intended for some sort of hair use (which may be less rough?)</li>
            <li>I should have considered more carefully the negative reviews</li>
            <li>The sprayer worked at first (though it always seemed a little flimsy), but after the third or fourth time using it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this to hold homemade bottom-cleaning spray for my one year old.  We use cloth wipes and use the spray with each diaper change.  I love this bottle.  My little one knocks it over and drops it frequently and it just keeps going.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and lightweight.  I have had trouble with the nozzle breaking on other brands of bottles, but the nozzle on this bottle is of a higher quality.  I am very happy with this bottle and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like to avoid plastic whenever possible.  It was great for a few days, when the top cover fell off the pump.  It was still usable for a couple of weeks, and then the pump was completely done.  We don&#x27;t use this often, perhaps once or twice a day, so this was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This item was broken in less than two weeks. Worthless. Do not buy. AL part is fine but the sprayer is junk.</li>
            <li> First of all, only one bottle comes. However, this is not the reason I am only giving the product one star. I just wanted to make sure that it was clear since three bottles are pictured, even though I know it was my own mistake mixing up this product with other spray bottles that do come in packs of three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my use of the bottle starting out on a disappointed note, I was still going to actually use to spray bottle before I wrote any sort of review. I used the bottle to hold some cleaner I had made for the kitchen. The sprayer worked at first (though it always seemed a little flimsy), but after the third or fourth time using it it just doesn&#x27;t spray anymore. The trigger is jammed somehow, and I don&#x27;t want to force it too hard in case the plastic cracks. Right now the sprayer isn&#x27;t of any use to me at all. Although this bottle may have been originally intended for some sort of hair use (which may be less rough?), I would still not expect it to break after only using it a hand full of times spraying 3-5 spritzes each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying some of the other spray bottles on here that are only a few dollars more for a pack of three. I actually found some at a local pharmacy that were only a couple of bucks each for a bigger size. All in all, not worth the $5 for the limited number of times I was able to use it.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for making your own cleaners for your home. I used these with essential oils to make non toxic cleaners and the spray bottle works perfectly. I love that the tubing is extra long so if there is any fluid in the bottle it should be able to reach it.</li>
            <li> the spayer is very flimsy and cheap and broke after very little use.  the bottle is also very thin and cheap</li>
            <li> This is a nice metal spray bottle and pretty reasonable price. Going to use if for Thieves cleaner.</li>
            <li> We use this for our cloth wipe solution. We were using a tiny spray bottle and we would have to spray the wipes multiple times, but then my husband suggested we get this. It is the perfect size and only takes a couple sprays! I was mislead by the picture and thought I would be getting three instead of one, but that was more due to my lack of reading.</li>
            <li> These are small but that is why I ordered them.  I made homemade non-toxic clear for my kids to help with the wiping and cleaning of surfaces.  This is perfect for their little hands to hold and operate.  If it had been any bigger it might be harder for this kids to operate themselves.  All and all great!  Sprays well and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting 3 and only received 1.  Very disappointed.  Would have ordered more in my shipment so I didn&#x27;t pay more shipping again.</li>
            <li> The bottle is fine, the sprayer is worthless.  I just put another sprayer on but I wouldn&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in non-working order.  The spraying device would not spray water on any setting, while the bottle was in working order.  However, the most important part of a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle is the ability to &amp;#34;spray.&amp;#34;  There have been several reviews about this product arriving broken or breaking within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> very disapointed i thought it was all 3 i was getting for that much but it was only 1 and it was pink. unhappy about purches</li>
            <li> This is really hard to spray for me.  It hurts my hand after 30 seconds or so and sometimes it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get the water to come out at all, period.  I ended up getting another plastic one because I couldn&#x27;t stand this one.  I was hoping for stainless to work out!</li>
            <li> YAY! I recieved the pink one LOL! This is your classic aluminum spray bottle! Functional and useful! It arrived quickly and in great condition. No Complaints!</li>
            <li> really works, great product, good quality . i recomend to all . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> stopped working shortly after purchase</li>
            <li> I love the aluminum bottle, but the sprayer stopped working after MAYBE 10 uses :( I&#x27;m looking for sprayers that will work with the bottle. Definitely NOT  worth the high price!!!</li>
            <li> IS A NICE SPRAY BOTTLE..AND WORKS WELL..&lt;br /&gt;IS A HIGH RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF THESE ITEMS, FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Totally false advertising. There&#x27;s no where to make you believe you&#x27;re only getting one?  Wouldn&#x27;t have paid this much for one bottle!</li>
            <li> I expected 3 (based on the photo), but got 1. It works well, so if you need a spray bottle, it works.</li>
            <li> good to use anything for the bottle</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this order, especially for the price! However, the picture is a bit deceiving. I thought I was getting 3 bottles, you only get one and you don&#x27;t get to pick the color. I take the blame for that because clearly I didn&#x27;t read the description properly. When I used the bottle for the first time I was really disappointed because the nozzle constantly leaks! Like a lot!! Bummer 👎</li>
            <li> I thought I would be receiving three of these. A little misleading in the add.</li>
            <li> I should have considered more carefully the negative reviews but I wanted a spray bottle that looks good and the other ones, that are plastic, don&#x27;t look as nice. However, this lasted less than two months and I probably did not use it more than six times. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I use these spay bottles to mist my indoor plants. And it serves its purpose well. They are small spray bottles but that is fine because I don&#x27;t need that much water to mist plants. They are easy to use and mine has not broken on me.</li>
            <li> very pretty bottle but the sprayer doesnt work .It wouldnt spray the first time I tried to use it .&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY this product</li>
            <li> Works great as long as you&#x27;re not picky about the color.  You just never know the color you&#x27;ll get.  Of course pink was the one that arrived.  Hahaha.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the box, the nozzle didn&#x27;t work.  Instead of spraying outward, water went downward all over my hand.  The canister is pretty though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, had no idea which color I was getting.  I ended up with silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray bottles are hit or miss anyway, for me it was a miss.</li>
            <li> The trigger hits the side of the bottle too soon so you don&#x27;t get much spray with each pump. Also, on one of my bottles (I ordered 3) it is nearly impossible to screw the lid on properly.</li>
            <li> the spray bottle works ok. i&#x27;m most upset because the picture shows three bottles. I only received one bottle. the listing is very VERY misleading. now I have a pink spray bottle that I don&#x27;t want. I wanted a black one and a silver one. it was cheap enough i&#x27;m not going to return it. i&#x27;ll find someone to give it too. Danny :(</li>
            <li> Basically functional. Works for my essential oil solutions without a problem thus far. DO NOT be a naïve person like me and thing it will create a beautiful mist of olive oil for your husband&#x27;s grilling adventures. Nope.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few months; it would spray once and then get stuck, unable to spray again.</li>
