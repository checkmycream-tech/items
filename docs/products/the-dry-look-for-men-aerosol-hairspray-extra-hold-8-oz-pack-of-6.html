            <li>This is a great way to buy it and comes right to your home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for many years.</li>

            <li>Excelent product, glad I can still get this on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I miss the pump spray version of my favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell like most men&#x27;s hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love the hairspray.</li>
            <li>, so glad that it is available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My experience was great - super fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It provides a strong hold without saturating or flattening my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but they don&#x27;t hold as well for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Scent free.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The old Pump Spray was much better!</li>
            <li>and I was right!  </li>
            <li>Guess that expression is true.</li>
            <li>came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes that is OK, but as a rule I prefer to look somewhat normal,</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making it easy for me to order.</li>
            <li>Perfect... this is the only place I can find The Dry Look....</li>
            <li>Very glad I picked The Dry Look.</li>
            <li>The six pack arrived quickly; on line seems to be the only way for me to get my favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>Great hairspray without that green apple smell!</li>
            <li>My husband uses hairspray to keep his hair looking nice throughout a long day.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived ahead of the time it was promised and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>But it is first class hairspray for men.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; any material thing</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good men&#x27;s hair spray then look no further than the Dry Look.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used this hairspray for years; he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff-not a knock off.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the way this product works for him. .</li>
            <li>and I love it over other junk.</li>
            <li>Dry Look is also easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have dug in on not going to a shaved head, this will buy you a little more time.</li>
            <li>The Dry Look is very effective at holding in place my thinning hair without making it hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Big mistake to only have this fine product in an Aerosol can.</li>
            <li>I live in Canada , Quebec , and I purchased these items, and payed with my credit card - Then was told the distributor would not ship to Canada...  </li>
            <li>Hubby can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>He really liked the holding power of the The Dry Look aerosol hairspray, and there was no funny smell.  </li>
            <li>This my second or third case I have purchased and will be back for more when I run out.</li>
            <li>; Everything old gets new again&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so a few minutes outside is all it takes to give me a &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>The other brands are too sticky or smell too sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is not carried in my local stores and my husband won&#x27;t use any other kind as long as I can get this.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and not stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if there are any other reviews here from women who used The Dry Look, but I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon in a package of 6.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>do stays soft  on hair</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like cement, though it doesn&#x27;t feel completely natural either.</li>
            <li>I gladly threw it in the trash after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>mens sprays can double for flooring adhesive and make you hair appear flat and one piece, this is the right balance between holding power and looking natual.</li>
            <li>want no other spray .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about $1.00 a can more expensive than it used to be in stores; however, it is significantly cheaper per can than other providers of remaining stocks.  </li>
            <li>If you want a Dry Look product you&#x27;d better get it now because when remaining stocks are gone there will be no more.</li>
            <li>It does a great job an does not look bad on you.</li>
            <li>All the young guys are using gel, like we did back in the 50&#x27;s days of the crewcut fad.</li>
            <li>Our only option was to use the really stinky stuff, or order The Dry Look from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t have much hair left, but he is still using The Dry Look, which has disappeared from store shelves in the western Pennsylvania</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine, and now it is thin and fine, not a great combo if you need a neat looking appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, but it is now almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This has been very hard to find in our area.  </li>
            <li> Lately, it seems to be difficult to find this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try spraying less to see if that helps, but even if it does, I still have to take a star off for the unpleasant smell of the spray.</li>
            <li> We are very sad that this hairspray is discontinued and so hard to find now.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray my husband likes, so he was very disappointed  when the stores quit carrying it.</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> We are unable to find it anywhere but on line.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find in the stores around here.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it controls and adds volume without creating a dirty oily look to my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He tried another brand that seems to be everywhere, but it had an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> Probably the worst hair product I&#x27;ve every tried.</li>

            <li> This is the only hair spray that my husband will use. He tells me that is keeps his hair in place without the stiffness. All the stores that use to carry it in my town stopped. Thanks Amazon for making it easy for me to order.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004AIC5GA The Dry Look For Men Aerosol Hair Spray Extra Hold, 8 oz (Pack of 3)]]My husband has used this hair spray for years, it is getting harder and harder for me to find. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon in a package of 6. This is a great way to buy it and comes right to your home. The product is the best hair spray he has found and he just will not use any thing else.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good men&#x27;s hair spray then look no further than the Dry Look.  This product will not gum up the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I live in Canada , Quebec , and I purchased these items, and payed with my credit card - Then was told the distributor would not ship to Canada...  NOT IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> Used for years - don&#x27;t ever stop stocking it!</li>
            <li> It was great to find a supply of hair spray that my husband likes.  It is no longer available. Great buy.</li>
            <li> My wife and I used Gilette hairspray for many years because of our allergies.  We could not find it in any stores.  But, we found it on Amazon and ordered several cans.  Great hairspray without that green apple smell!</li>
            <li> This is all he uses.  We are unable to find it anywhere but on line.  It&#x27;s a must for his daily routine.</li>
            <li> Gillette Dry Look hairspray is the only hairspray my husband will use. The other brands are too sticky or smell too sweet.  It is getting harder and harder to find Dry Look in retail stores.  I was very pleased to be able to buy a 6 pack of this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband prefers The Dry Look, for Men, over all the other hairspray that he has tried over the years.  It works better on his hair than others that become sticky and/or do not hold well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy this in our stores, so the fact that it&#x27;s available at all, makes it perfect.  This is my husband&#x27;s preference; he doesn&#x27;t like any other brand he has tried.</li>
            <li> the best hair spray, 2nd order</li>
            <li> Dry look hair spray holds and is not sticky .I have used it for many years and I love it over other junk.</li>
            <li> I love it. Finally a hair spray for people with wispy hair. Holds and does not look goopy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in any stores in my area and this is such a convenient way to shop. Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> My husband uses hairspray to keep his hair looking nice throughout a long day.  He tried another brand that seems to be everywhere, but it had an unpleasant odor.  Personally, I couldn&#x27;t stand being in a room where he had just used that stuff.  He really liked the holding power of the The Dry Look aerosol hairspray, and there was no funny smell.  My son uses it, as well.  It stopped being stocked in stores in my area.  We looked in several places, and it was no longer being carried.  Our only option was to use the really stinky stuff, or order The Dry Look from Amazon.  We have plenty to last, now, for the men in the household.  Best grown men&#x27;s hairspray out there.</li>
            <li> Only brand my husband likes and can use. You can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;&#x27;t find this in any store nearby and it is the only hairspray my husband will use.  I know if I checked on Amazon I would find it and I was right!  This is the 4th thing that is off the market shelves in my area that I have found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and they are hard to find in the stores. I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> Perfect... this is the only place I can find The Dry Look.... my husband loves it..</li>
            <li> Excelent product, glad I can still get this on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The Dry Look for Men is what I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s non-sticky, and undetectable. I would recommend it to any guy who&lt;br /&gt;wants to look good, for a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this hairspray for years; he really likes it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have dug in on not going to a shaved head, this will buy you a little more time. My hair has always been fine, and now it is thin and fine, not a great combo if you need a neat looking appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most mens sprays can double for flooring adhesive and make you hair appear flat and one piece, this is the right balance between holding power and looking natual. My hair musses just turning my head without it, so my options were shaved head, greasy kid stuff, a very short haircut, or this. Very glad I picked The Dry Look.</li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s fav, hard to find, found it here.  Will order again</li>
            <li> The Dry Look is very effective at holding in place my thinning hair without making it hard or sticky.  It looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> its great does not build up like others do stays soft  on hair keeps it in place  in the wind</li>
            <li> have used this product for years. It does a great job an does not look bad on you. want no other spray .</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND IN STORES.  The six pack arrived quickly; on line seems to be the only way for me to get my favorite hair spray. Can&#x27;t find it in any stores!</li>
            <li> I miss the pump spray version of my favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li> The hairspray was wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used this project for over 25+ years because I do not care for the hairspray that is made for women.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and still seems to be the same thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so a few minutes outside is all it takes to give me a &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; look. Sometimes that is OK, but as a rule I prefer to look somewhat normal, whatever that means. I tried &amp;#34;The Dry Look&amp;#34; a number of years ago and it did the job. My hair didn&#x27;t look like I had rubbed 10W30 into it, and I didn&#x27;t ooze white grease when it got wet. Perfect product! I could get it from my local drug store, grocery store, or department store. While I was living in bliss the unthinkable happened. One by one, all the stores stopped carrying it. I wiped out shelves as it went on clearance quicker than a yankee scoops up soup in a hurricane warning. My stockpile dwindled until I discovered Amazon. Thank you Amazon. Let&#x27;s do lunch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Dry Look, for Men hairspray for over 10 years.  I like it because it controls and adds volume without creating a dirty oily look to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Dry Look is also easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Hubby can&#x27;t live without these. We are very sad that this hairspray is discontinued and so hard to find now. But it is first class hairspray for men.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray my husband likes, so he was very disappointed  when the stores quit carrying it. I am so happy I have been able to order it online. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell like most men&#x27;s hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, but it is now almost impossible to find in stores. It provides a strong hold without saturating or flattening my thinning hair. I have tried many hair sprays, but none are as effective as this one. I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This was standard sized cans.  We can&#x27;t find it anywhere else and my husband relies on this product.  Good value too!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND WOULD NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;HE HAS TRIED OTHERS THRU THE YEARS AND ALWAYS&lt;br /&gt;COME BACK TO DRY LOOK.  I USE IT ALSO.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied I have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and years - local drug chains now using shelf space for something else - Yes, it&#x27;s shelf space that drives these decisions!</li>
            <li> This is the very best hair spray for men.  It holds my hair just the way I like it.  It looks natural and not stiff.</li>
            <li> This is not carried in my local stores and my husband won&#x27;t use any other kind as long as I can get this.  I use it too.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected</li>
            <li> Love the hairspray. I don&#x27;t know why it is discontinued.. In a bind, this can replace my matte, wax, pomade etc.. I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the dry look hairspray, because it doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t get sticky like other sprays.  The wind can blow and mess up the hair but it will always go back into place and not be hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in the stores around here.  All the young guys are using gel, like we did back in the 50&#x27;s days of the crewcut fad. &amp;#34; Everything old gets new again&amp;#34;. Guess that expression is true.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and this is the only one that he likes</li>
            <li> Gillette has discontinued the Dry Look product line of men&#x27;s hairspray.  I&#x27;ve tried others but they don&#x27;t hold as well for fine hair.  This is the real stuff-not a knock off.  It&#x27;s about $1.00 a can more expensive than it used to be in stores; however, it is significantly cheaper per can than other providers of remaining stocks.  If you want a Dry Look product you&#x27;d better get it now because when remaining stocks are gone there will be no more.</li>
            <li> came quickly.  very good product.</li>
            <li> Good product that does the job.  Scent free.  Hard to find, so glad that it is available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t have much hair left, but he is still using The Dry Look, which has disappeared from store shelves in the western Pennsylvania area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if there are any other reviews here from women who used The Dry Look, but I&#x27;ve been using it for years. When my husband and I travel we only need one can of hairspray!</li>
            <li> No one carries this anymore! I am so happy you have it. My experience was great - super fast shipment. Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; any material thing so rating of five stars not applicable.  Otherwise product met my expectations and specifications as written therefore rating of four stars.</li>
            <li> This has been very hard to find in our area.  My husband really likes the way this product works for him. .</li>
            <li> I have always used this product, and have been very satisfied with it.  Lately, it seems to be difficult to find this product.  But, having said that, Amazon to the rescue.  I looked in Amazon, and ound it.  Again, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good formulation that isn&#x27;t sticky and has very good hold. Depending upon the nozzle for top performance it is good to wash them by soaking in warm water once or more per week.</li>
            <li> I like how this feels very similar to the Got2b product I used that got discontinued a while back. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like cement, though it doesn&#x27;t feel completely natural either. I&#x27;ll try spraying less to see if that helps, but even if it does, I still have to take a star off for the unpleasant smell of the spray. I&#x27;ll have to get used to this since I gambled and got 6 of them.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and has always used it!! he was thrilled when I was able to find it again!!!.</li>
            <li> Every review above 1 or 2 stars has to be fake.  Probably the worst hair product I&#x27;ve every tried. I gladly threw it in the trash after only a few uses.</li>
