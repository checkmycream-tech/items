    <ol>
            <li>Great product, I use it before waxing every time, it preps skin and seems to help prevent skin irritation.</li>
            <li>This is great after the waxing.</li>
            <li>Lovemaking is great with this.</li>
            <li>Worked great as described.</li>
            <li>Great quality.  </li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Amazing and awesome...</li>
            <li>It is pleasant smelling and literally it made me feel no pain in the waxing process.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Might be a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without this, the wax may stick to your skin which is very challenging to remove.</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a nice pre -epilation oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of runny, though.</li>
            <li>Like, watery, kind of.</li>
            <li>However the seller was very nice about it and sent me another free of charge.</li>
            <li>I think it has to do with the tension, its a cheap addition, you can splurge!</li>
            <li>It would be better if it had some hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It helps the wax stick to your hair better</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But, more times than not, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for left over wax residue</li>
            <li>but if you use too much it will snatch the wax off of the strips because it sticks so good.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>I used the smaller bottle of this oil  liked it and glad that I found lil bigger bottle awesome for before Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in pain too.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this really works????</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use prior to waxing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to others who want a pain free waxing session.</li>
            <li>, I was more red when not, so its good to make it a habit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a must have, but for first timers it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is the first pre-epilation oil that I&#x27;ve used and I can surely say I will stick to this one.</li>
            <li>Really makes the process go more smoothly...</li>
            <li>and it really helps easy the pain of waxing by preventing the wax from sticking to the skin.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li>you may not need it all the time, but initially it is worth having it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to clean up and wax doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin at all.</li>
            <li>Great for using before hard waxing.</li>
            <li>Besides the packing this is one great product and is a must for hard waxing</li>
            <li>really helps soothe the epilation area before said epilation.</li>
            <li>This product really makes all the difference when your waxing.</li>
            <li>Plus, I really think it helps with pain too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>where has this been my whole life.</li>
            <li>But I always make sure that I blot out the excess oil from my skin because if there&#x27;s too much oil,  the hard wax tends to let the hair slip off too,  making waxing less effective.</li>
            <li>Although I find the price to be a bit high for the size of the bottle, I have no other option because I need it</li>
            <li>I use this with Cirepil Blue hard wax and it works effectively by preventing the wax from ripping my skin off.</li>
            <li>Like this product it leaves skin soft and silky</li>
            <li>Works well for waxing at home especially if you are new to waxing-</li>
            <li>I received this bottle unsealed, 3/4 full, and with a slightly faded label... is it possible it was a sample bottle and had been used?</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much with each session so the bottle will surely last you a long time.</li>
            <li>For depilation with hard wax this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin soft and ready to wax.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I thought it would be suitable to numb the skin before the use of the epilator.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it has a ton of other uses.</li>
            <li> Purchased extra to have after the small bottles that came with the set ran out.  </li>
            <li> This product is necessary if you plan to wax with the GiGi Brazilian Body Hard wax.</li>
            <li> less irritation when you wax.</li>
            <li> I get less irritation when I use this pre-epilation oil.</li>
            <li> Another GiGi product just arrived in even worse condition than this, with the unsealed bottle open and spilled into the delivery box, losing half the content...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use it, but the cost of return almost equals the cost of the product, so it would simply be a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is called pre-epilation.</li>
            <li> I use strip-free hard wax, and this oil keeps the wax from sticking to my skin.  </li>
            <li> As this oil makes a world of a difference when using hard wax, I needed to reorder ASAP.</li>
            <li> but the name is highly confusing</li>
            <li> Seriously, get this.</li>
            <li> I have had to get this product twice because the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Makes waxing so much less painful</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that when it arrived the bottle was dirty and sticky but did wash off.</li>
            <li> What a skin saver this bad boy is!</li>

            <li> less irritation when you wax. ive compared times when I didn&#x27;t use it, I was more red when not, so its good to make it a habit. I think it has to do with the tension, its a cheap addition, you can splurge!</li>
            <li> Product does not work at all. It does prevent wax from sticking to your skin,  but you also won&#x27;t remove any hairs. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it before waxing every time, it preps skin and seems to help prevent skin irritation.</li>

            <li> This smells horrible,&lt;br /&gt;But really helps soothe the epilation area before said epilation. It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s kind of runny, though. Like, watery, kind of. So just so you know.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is called pre-epilation. I thought it would be suitable to numb the skin before the use of the epilator. It is only for waxing. Might be a good product but the name is highly confusing</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use the Gigi system, this is a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this, the wax may stick to your skin which is very challenging to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a must have, but for first timers it&#x27;s fantastic! Not to mention it has a ton of other uses.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It makes a difference on my skin when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t use it. I get less irritation when I use this pre-epilation oil. Just use a very tiny amount to get the job done. The only downside is sometimes this product prevents wax from adhering and pulling hair properly. But, more times than not, it works just fine. I like this product &amp; would recommend using it.</li>
            <li> I have found that this oil does the job.  I use strip-free hard wax, and this oil keeps the wax from sticking to my skin.  Works as described.</li>
            <li> Worked great as described. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great for using before hard waxing.</li>
            <li> This product really makes all the difference when your waxing. Seriously, get this. It&#x27;s so much easier to clean up and wax doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin at all. Plus, I really think it helps with pain too.</li>

            <li> This product is necessary if you plan to wax with the GiGi Brazilian Body Hard wax. It made a huge difference in pain too.</li>
            <li> Trust me, a baby oil is enough!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this really works????</li>
            <li> I like this product. Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use prior to waxing. It is pleasant smelling and literally it made me feel no pain in the waxing process. It was not oily or left a residue. This is the first pre-epilation oil that I&#x27;ve used and I can surely say I will stick to this one. You don&#x27;t need to use much with each session so the bottle will surely last you a long time. I would recommend this product to others who want a pain free waxing session.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle unsealed, 3/4 full, and with a slightly faded label... is it possible it was a sample bottle and had been used? shouldn&#x27;t these be sealed? I&#x27;m not going to use it, but the cost of return almost equals the cost of the product, so it would simply be a waste of time. Another GiGi product just arrived in even worse condition than this, with the unsealed bottle open and spilled into the delivery box, losing half the content... I won&#x27;t order GiGi products through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months now!</li>
            <li> LOVE! What a skin saver this bad boy is! The one complaint I have is that when it arrived the bottle was dirty and sticky but did wash off. Besides the packing this is one great product and is a must for hard waxing</li>
            <li> I bought the wax kit and accidentally spilled the pre-epilation oil after 1st use. As this oil makes a world of a difference when using hard wax, I needed to reorder ASAP. Although I find the price to be a bit high for the size of the bottle, I have no other option because I need it and it works!</li>
            <li> Great item. Recieved on time. Was just like purchased at the store at a fraction of the price. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Purchased extra to have after the small bottles that came with the set ran out.  Works well for waxing at home especially if you are new to waxing- you may not need it all the time, but initially it is worth having it.</li>
            <li> I use nothing else when prepping for waxing.  I use a cotton ball to swab the areas to wax then hang use it throughout waxing to retouch my fingertips.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and it really helps easy the pain of waxing by preventing the wax from sticking to the skin. This bottle will last you several waxes as you only need about a quarter size per section.</li>
            <li> For depilation with hard wax this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin soft and ready to wax.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing and awesome... where has this been my whole life. It is counterintuitive that this works but it does and is grrrrreat!!</li>
            <li> Really makes the process go more smoothly...</li>
