            <li>Delicious scent.</li>
            <li>It seems this company has a great selection of wonderful products.</li>
            <li>I had bought an incredible perfune from Pusser&#x27;s in the BVI&#x27;s and now they do not sell it anymore.  </li>
            <li>A great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really wonderful to have so many choices and not have to worry about damaging my health.</li>
            <li>I used to work in Honolulu and this smells better than the best one I found there.</li>
            <li>Good service, good product.</li>
            <li>A light delightful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Stays with me a good 5 hours.  </li>
            <li>anymore I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>While the cologne is beautiful the perfume is richer and more dimensional.</li>
            <li>Very elegant bottle though.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is definitely very lovely and has some musky tones.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, very satisfied with my experience with this seller.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Smells great and arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li>So after doing some research on Terra Nova and there products I decided to try one more time, and I am so glad that I did.   </li>
            <li>Plumeria is still my favorite</li>
            <li>I am quite giddy with so many choices.   </li>
            <li>Having purchased both from Terra Nova and Amazon I found Amazon has the better price unless Terra Nova is having a sale.  </li>
            <li>so it is worthwhile to check out their web site.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an authentic plumeria scent, this is it.  </li>
            <li>Like most perfumes, it has a long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>When we were in Hawaii, we fell in love with the Plumeria flower.  </li>
            <li>Even in Hawaii, where there are so many versions of &amp;#34;plumeria perfume&amp;#34;, I didn&#x27;t find one.  </li>
            <li>When I went to Maui, I fell in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival, this bottle smelled more like oil, with just a hint of the plumeria.</li>
            <li>then i saw this listed, and i decided to give it one more try based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>i am sooooooo glad i did.  </li>
            <li>This smells more like gardenia than plumeria.</li>
            <li>Lovely bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok.  </li>
            <li>Cute plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>I love Plumeria and since I can&#x27;t get the spray at Bath &amp; Body Works</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Please enjoy it !</li>
            <li>You will receive many compliments when you wear this lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I love Terra Nota perfumes</li>
            <li>fragrance is just lovely and plenty strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I just sent some to my mom for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>If anyone wants a good plumeria perfume I recommend Auric Blends and Perfumes of Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It is strong, but when used the right way, smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I go back to Hawaii,as I&#x27;m picking up that freshly fallen flower and smelling that wonderful scent!</li>
            <li>Easy to spill.  </li>
            <li>Not just stronger but more true to the experience of the plumeria flower.   </li>
            <li>After over a decade of searching I have finely found what I have been looking for.   </li>
            <li>This oil based plumeria essence is very nice on bare shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The real frangipani from the Cook Islands has a gentle fragrance that is a joy to smell.</li>
            <li>as a everyday wear it&#x27;s not the best choice for a perfume since it&#x27;s too concentrated and too dense.</li>
            <li>The smell does have great lasting power</li>
            <li>This fragrance fills the room with a light floral scent</li>
            <li>and I enjoy</li>
            <li>I love the scent of plumeria, and thought this product might be just like fresh plumeria flowers.</li>
            <li>so it was really for him, but I&#x27;m glad he was able to share the glorious scents from his youth with me.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very strong, even using just a dab, but smells very authentically Plumeria.  </li>
            <li>This scent really transports me back to that beautiful island.</li>
            <li>This has a very sickly, sweet odor, almost nauseating.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for two or three hours and then fades to nothing.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very close to what most people think of when it comes to plumeria.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely fragrance and probably the closest I&#x27;ve found to the real thing.</li>
            <li>when I sleep, it isn&#x27;t good enough to wear when going out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad aroma</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;plumeria perfume essence\\&quot; smells just like the real flower, except it&#x27;s not quite as strong or as sweet in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume for it&#x27;s elegant, sexy, romantic, and classy smell all wrapped into one.</li>
            <li>Pretty scent!</li>
            <li>fragrance is sweet and rich, like real plumeria blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Others seem artificial, this is made from pure plumeria oil (cannot even imagine what kind of effort it takes to extract oil from this flower) and smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>It smells beautiful and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>On an up-note, it did come in a pretty bottle, and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells really good very sweet and just like the flower, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The aroma from this product is gentle, sweet and alluring.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very much like the plumeria.  </li>
            <li>the delivery was very fast, and i just couldn&#x27;t be happier with this transaction.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest, best smelling perfume without smelling cheap and fake!</li>
            <li>Their scents are subtle and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It lasted about 10 minutes then had a funny, lingering smell.  </li>
            <li>This one is exactly the essence of that aroma.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a lovely product.</li>
            <li>but I also love Shea Blossom, White Ginger and Lime Blossom Jasmine.  </li>
            <li>, I got it promptly, and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I at first chalked it up to being in the hot mailbox.</li>
            <li>This is just exactly what I have been waiting for.</li>
            <li>This product smells just like the real thing!</li>
            <li>When I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is really nice to smell the subtle scent of the beautiful hawaiian flower, even if I am the only one who catches glimpses of the fragrance (so far... )</li>
            <li>The scent lasts long without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It smells soft and sweet and citrus-like.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been looking forever for that pure plumeria scent of my childhood.  </li>
            <li>Terra Nova Plumeria perfume smells so genuine it brings you back immediately to the islands of Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Terra Nova is very generous with samples and they have a diverse selection of products including body washes, lotions, butters and products for hair and nails</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The scent gone away really fast.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, sweet but not cloying, very floral and believable.</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I love it and smells just like I expected.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t want people to know that</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Most other items are just perfumes that don&#x27;t even resemble the plumeria scent.</li>
            <li>Finally a plumeria perfume that smells just like the fresh picked flower!</li>
            <li>Originally bought this in Hawaii on vacation and found it on Amazon once I was running low.</li>
            <li>After first ordering the Terra Nova Plumeria perfume at Amazon I ordered the spray cologne directly from Terra Nova.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my new signature perfume, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li>Though this is less than an ounce of perfume, it is in a beautiful little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Lovely natural scent but not very long lasting</li>
            <li>thank you, amazon, for bringing so many items to us that, otherwise, would have gone unnoticed.</li>
            <li>It does smell exactly like the real plumeria flower, BUT has NO lasting power -- literally, the smell is gone after 15 minutes...</li>
            <li>and you are left with a funny after-smell of something very close to vulcanized rubber...</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of other perfumes touting island scents and none have ever measured up to Terra Nova&#x27;s quality and fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>(I live in the south)</li>
            <li>that way - over 24 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TerraNova has done such a great job capturing this delicate scent, that I&#x27;m struggling to decide which of their products to try next.  </li>
            <li>My 93 yr old grandmother loves this!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Hawaii and it isn&#x27;t too strong, or too subtle.</li>
            <li>There has been quite a bit of research on the positive emotional effects of sent.</li>
            <li>I am not only very demanding about the fragrance, I am sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>Wow everytime I smell it</li>
            <li>As far as staying power, on me it smells like it fades within an hour.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming, soft and smells so feminine and tropical.</li>
            <li>, I find there&#x27;s something very breezy and romantic about it.</li>
            <li>I think it has decent lasting power, too.</li>
            <li>:) It is an&lt;br /&gt;oil which I was not aware of, NOT full of chemicals</li>
            <li>But 4 hours later, my husband will smell it on me clearly.  </li>
            <li>It is so overpoweringly cloying that, even though the bottle was intact and completely sealed; i could still smell it from outside the unopened box.</li>
            <li>Does not last entire day into evening but bottle is small and easily carried in purse.</li>
            <li>Do note that if you are sensitive to fragrances and prone to headaches when exposed to heavy odors, to use this item very sparingly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a truly lovely scent - subtle, and with only a single note.  </li>

            <li> When I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is really nice to smell the subtle scent of the beautiful hawaiian flower, even if I am the only one who catches glimpses of the fragrance (so far... )</li>
            <li> The scent lasts long without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells soft and sweet and citrus-like.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been looking forever for that pure plumeria scent of my childhood.  </li>
            <li> Terra Nova Plumeria perfume smells so genuine it brings you back immediately to the islands of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Terra Nova is very generous with samples and they have a diverse selection of products including body washes, lotions, butters and products for hair and nails</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The scent gone away really fast.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, sweet but not cloying, very floral and believable.</li>
            <li> It smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love it and smells just like I expected.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t want people to know that</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Most other items are just perfumes that don&#x27;t even resemble the plumeria scent.</li>
            <li> Finally a plumeria perfume that smells just like the fresh picked flower!</li>
            <li> Originally bought this in Hawaii on vacation and found it on Amazon once I was running low.</li>
            <li> After first ordering the Terra Nova Plumeria perfume at Amazon I ordered the spray cologne directly from Terra Nova.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become my new signature perfume, I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> Though this is less than an ounce of perfume, it is in a beautiful little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Lovely natural scent but not very long lasting</li>
            <li> thank you, amazon, for bringing so many items to us that, otherwise, would have gone unnoticed.</li>
            <li> It does smell exactly like the real plumeria flower, BUT has NO lasting power -- literally, the smell is gone after 15 minutes...</li>
            <li> and you are left with a funny after-smell of something very close to vulcanized rubber...</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other perfumes touting island scents and none have ever measured up to Terra Nova&#x27;s quality and fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> (I live in the south)</li>
            <li> that way - over 24 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TerraNova has done such a great job capturing this delicate scent, that I&#x27;m struggling to decide which of their products to try next.  </li>
            <li> My 93 yr old grandmother loves this!</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Hawaii and it isn&#x27;t too strong, or too subtle.</li>
            <li> There has been quite a bit of research on the positive emotional effects of sent.</li>
            <li> I am not only very demanding about the fragrance, I am sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> Wow everytime I smell it</li>
            <li> As far as staying power, on me it smells like it fades within an hour.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calming, soft and smells so feminine and tropical.</li>
            <li> , I find there&#x27;s something very breezy and romantic about it.</li>
            <li> I think it has decent lasting power, too.</li>
            <li> :) It is an&lt;br /&gt;oil which I was not aware of, NOT full of chemicals</li>
            <li> But 4 hours later, my husband will smell it on me clearly.  </li>
            <li> It is so overpoweringly cloying that, even though the bottle was intact and completely sealed; i could still smell it from outside the unopened box.</li>
            <li> Does not last entire day into evening but bottle is small and easily carried in purse.</li>
            <li> Do note that if you are sensitive to fragrances and prone to headaches when exposed to heavy odors, to use this item very sparingly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a truly lovely scent - subtle, and with only a single note.  </li>
            <li> Had looked a long time to find something that actually smelled like plumeria.  </li>
            <li> should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Stronger when first applied, but wares off slowly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> (Strangely, my husband insists that it smells just like a gardenia...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the fragrance all day long.</li>
            <li> this rate, this tiny little bottle of heady fragrance will last a long time.</li>
            <li> just put one tiny dot it on one wrist, than rub the other wrist over</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is that I wish it lasted a little while longer on me</li>
            <li> This little bottle last forever.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it has a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been missing the smell of the plumeria since she used to live in HI when I was little!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways, so be careful....</li>
            <li> I have tried sample of six other Terra Nova products and I have not had an adverse reaction to any of them.   </li>
            <li> But a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t overdue it!</li>
            <li> but I might try layering with the other Terranova Plumeria body products .</li>
            <li> Or at least those are all words that have been used to describe the smell when I&#x27;ve been in the company of different people.</li>
            <li> Has the quality of this company&#x27;s product gone down?</li>
            <li> i, too, have had so much trouble finding the scent of the plumeria since my husband and i were in hawaii  25 years ago.  </li>
            <li> That said, i did dab a tiny bit behind my ears, collarbone, temple areas and the smell is just not anything i care for.</li>
            <li> The perfume fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Green smell, for my nose it&#x27;s not plumeria((</li>
            <li> By contrast, this concoction has an unbearably heavy smell that lingers on and on and made me run to the nearest pharmacy in search of an aspirin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they tried very hard to capture the essence of plumeria, but this isn&#x27;t it. :(</li>
            <li> The one from, Terranova I was not pleased with.  </li>
            <li> The small bottle was in a plastic bag and placed in a box with no protective wrap.  </li>
            <li> because I like keeping it my little secret.</li>
            <li> A subtle essence of one of the finest floral creations ever made.  </li>
            <li> Not a good quality.  </li>
            <li> My friend found one on the Air Force Base BX store and it&#x27;s the same brand as this.  </li>
            <li> I just received my Terranova Plumeria and i am SO not happy with this scent.</li>
            <li> Very subtle but flowery fragrant.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 separate items from them and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> A disappointment!</li>
            <li> To me, it smells very artificial.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the way it was packaged.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil based plumeria essence is very nice on bare shoulders.  It is really nice to smell the subtle scent of the beautiful hawaiian flower, even if I am the only one who catches glimpses of the fragrance (so far... ) I just started using it!</li>
            <li> Lovely natural scent but not very long lasting</li>
            <li> This has a very sickly, sweet odor, almost nauseating.  It lasted about 10 minutes then had a funny, lingering smell.  So sorry I purchased it.  Very elegant bottle though.  Wish there was a way to get rid of it &amp; get back some of my money..</li>
            <li> The heavenly smell of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume with the aroma of plumeria (a flower). This one is exactly the essence of that aroma. It even feels oily on the skin. as a everyday wear it&#x27;s not the best choice for a perfume since it&#x27;s too concentrated and too dense.</li>
            <li> I wanted to a scent to remind me of the frangipani that was on every street in Key West. I collected frangipani flowers every day that I was there just to have that scent. When I got home to the mid-atlantic there was nothing that resembled the smell of frangipani.    THIS IS IT! Finally, I found something that actually smells like frangipani/plumeria. Most other items are just perfumes that don&#x27;t even resemble the plumeria scent. This is the closest I have found and I will buy it again. The others are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Just got it today. Finally a plumeria perfume that smells just like the fresh picked flower! I smelled every plumeria perfume I have come across at home and Hawaii and not one came close. This is the one to buy! Wow everytime I smell it I go back to Hawaii,as I&#x27;m picking up that freshly fallen flower and smelling that wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when I wear this scent especially from my boyfriend.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Terra Nova Plumeria perfume smells so genuine it brings you back immediately to the islands of Hawaii. The scent lasts long without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my husband who grew up in Hawaii....so it was really for him, but I&#x27;m glad he was able to share the glorious scents from his youth with me. Thank you for such a lovely product.</li>
            <li> Terra Nova Plumeria perfume is ambrosia for plumeria/frangipani lovers. After over a decade of searching I have finely found what I have been looking for.   I have tried perfume from department&#x27;s stores, Hawaiian specialty shops and samples from on-line perfume companies and not found the fragrance experience I was trying to recreate.   I am not only very demanding about the fragrance, I am sensitive to chemicals. The chemicals in some perfumes include: hormone-disrupters, neurotoxins and probable carcinogens.    So after doing some research on Terra Nova and there products I decided to try one more time, and I am so glad that I did.   There has been quite a bit of research on the positive emotional effects of sent. Lemon has been found to abate depression in several studies. The effect this Plumeria fragrance has on me is close to euphoria.   After first ordering the Terra Nova Plumeria perfume at Amazon I ordered the spray cologne directly from Terra Nova.  While the cologne is beautiful the perfume is richer and more dimensional. Not just stronger but more true to the experience of the plumeria flower.   I have tried sample of six other Terra Nova products and I have not had an adverse reaction to any of them.   Plumeria is still my favorite but I also love Shea Blossom, White Ginger and Lime Blossom Jasmine.  It&#x27;s really wonderful to have so many choices and not have to worry about damaging my health. I am quite giddy with so many choices.   Having purchased both from Terra Nova and Amazon I found Amazon has the better price unless Terra Nova is having a sale.  Terra Nova is very generous with samples and they have a diverse selection of products including body washes, lotions, butters and products for hair and nails so it is worthwhile to check out their web site.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;plumeria perfume essence\\&quot; smells just like the real flower, except it&#x27;s not quite as strong or as sweet in my opinion.  But I&#x27;m not complaining at ALL, I&#x27;ve been looking forever for that pure plumeria scent of my childhood.  (Strangely, my husband insists that it smells just like a gardenia... I guess they are similar?  Men!! &gt;.&lt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly lovely scent - subtle, and with only a single note.  *Finally!!*  I didn&#x27;t end up receiving a perfume that claimed to be plumeria, but is actually a mixture of notes that includes (and often overpowers) plumeria!  As far as staying power, on me it smells like it fades within an hour.  But 4 hours later, my husband will smell it on me clearly.  I guess the wearer just gets used to it?  Because of this, I have experimented with putting drops of the perfume essence on silk flowers around the house.  The smell does have great lasting power that way - over 24 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TerraNova has done such a great job capturing this delicate scent, that I&#x27;m struggling to decide which of their products to try next.  Any suggestions?  :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for it&#x27;s elegant, sexy, romantic, and classy smell all wrapped into one. Or at least those are all words that have been used to describe the smell when I&#x27;ve been in the company of different people. It&#x27;s become my new signature perfume, I&#x27;d buy it again! But a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t overdue it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance fills the room with a light floral scent&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s as if you were smelling the flower itself.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it and so does my husband :) It is an&lt;br /&gt;oil which I was not aware of, NOT full of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;that make my head feel like it will burst and I enjoy&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance all day long. Love it!</li>
            <li> All I can say is, I got what I ordered, I got it promptly, and it was exactly what I wanted. Good service, good product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an authentic plumeria scent, this is it.  Others seem artificial, this is made from pure plumeria oil (cannot even imagine what kind of effort it takes to extract oil from this flower) and smells awesome.  Like most perfumes, it has a long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent! It&#x27;s calming, soft and smells so feminine and tropical. I think this would make a particularly excellent wedding scent, I find there&#x27;s something very breezy and romantic about it. This is hands-down the BEST Plumeria perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. The only thing I would change is that I wish it lasted a little while longer on me but I might try layering with the other Terranova Plumeria body products .</li>
            <li> When we were in Hawaii, we fell in love with the Plumeria flower.  It&#x27;s so fragrant.  But all the perfume stores and markets tried to immitate the smell just did not do it justice.  My friend found one on the Air Force Base BX store and it&#x27;s the same brand as this.  It&#x27;s the closest, best smelling perfume without smelling cheap and fake! I loved it so much, I just sent some to my mom for her birthday.  She&#x27;s been missing the smell of the plumeria since she used to live in HI when I was little!</li>
            <li> A light delightful fragrance.  Does not last entire day into evening but bottle is small and easily carried in purse.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the plumeria I re breed from HI</li>
            <li> Had looked a long time to find something that actually smelled like plumeria.  Even in Hawaii, where there are so many versions of &amp;#34;plumeria perfume&amp;#34;, I didn&#x27;t find one.  This one does, though!  Love it!  A little goes a long ways, so be careful....should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and arrived quickly!  Very subtle but flowery fragrant.  Stronger when first applied, but wares off slowly throughout the day.  Stays with me a good 5 hours.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> When I went to Maui, I fell in love with this fragrance. Upon arrival, this bottle smelled more like oil, with just a hint of the plumeria. I at first chalked it up to being in the hot mailbox. (I live in the south) But it wasn&#x27;t that. It just smells that way. Was it cut with oil to make it go further? Has the quality of this company&#x27;s product gone down? I don&#x27;t know, but I wish I had my $15 back.</li>
            <li> It seems this company has a great selection of wonderful products. I have ordered 3 separate items from them and have not been disappointed. Their scents are subtle and beautiful.</li>
            <li> i, too, have had so much trouble finding the scent of the plumeria since my husband and i were in hawaii  25 years ago.  i had given up even trying.  then i saw this listed, and i decided to give it one more try based on the reviews.  i am sooooooo glad i did.  i swear i was in hawaii.  the scent is very much like the plumeria.  it is a scent you don&#x27;t forget.  the delivery was very fast, and i just couldn&#x27;t be happier with this transaction.      thank you, amazon, for bringing so many items to us that, otherwise, would have gone unnoticed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my wife loves plumeria. This is the real deal. It smells soft and sweet and citrus-like. I think it is an oil concentrate so use it sparingly. I used to work in Honolulu and this smells better than the best one I found there. You can buy it with confidence. I used prime 2nd day and it came on our anniversary. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This smells more like gardenia than plumeria.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful. The smell is delicious. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A great fragrance.  I just wish it lasted longer.  It&#x27;s only good for two or three hours and then fades to nothing.</li>
            <li> The scent gone away really fast. Only the oil smell left one week after opening.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, sweet but not cloying, very floral and believable. Lovely bottle.</li>
            <li> This scent definitely makes me reminisce of my vacation in Hawaii. The fragrance is definitely very lovely and has some musky tones. Do note that if you are sensitive to fragrances and prone to headaches when exposed to heavy odors, to use this item very sparingly. It is strong, but when used the right way, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is just exactly what I have been waiting for. It smells exactly like Hawaii and it isn&#x27;t too strong, or too subtle. I will forever carry this with me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since finding it on a trip to Hawaii over 10 years ago. It smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product smells just like the real thing! As soon as I took off the cap I was transported to paradise.</li>
            <li> It does smell exactly like the real plumeria flower, BUT has NO lasting power -- literally, the smell is gone after 15 minutes... and you are left with a funny after-smell of something very close to vulcanized rubber... and it gives me quite a headache. A disappointment!</li>
            <li> I just received my Terranova Plumeria and i am SO not happy with this scent. I guess that is what i get for stepping out and buying this online, not having a clue of what it smells like. It is so overpoweringly cloying that, even though the bottle was intact and completely sealed; i could still smell it from outside the unopened box. That said, i did dab a tiny bit behind my ears, collarbone, temple areas and the smell is just not anything i care for. To me, it smells very artificial. Unless you already know what to expect with this scent, i would not recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> Just like roses, plumeria have different fragrances depending on the varietal. This perfume is very close to what most people think of when it comes to plumeria. It is a lovely fragrance and probably the closest I&#x27;ve found to the real thing. I think it has decent lasting power, too.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of plumeria, and thought this product might be just like fresh plumeria flowers. It is not. I&#x27;m sure they tried very hard to capture the essence of plumeria, but this isn&#x27;t it. :( On an up-note, it did come in a pretty bottle, and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes. Not a good quality.  I am using it at night when I sleep, it isn&#x27;t good enough to wear when going out.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 different plumeria perfumes/oils.  The one from, Terranova I was not pleased with.  The scent is ok.  The scent once it is applied has a skunk like smell to it.  I can not wear this perfume.  I was very disappointed with the way it was packaged.  The small bottle was in a plastic bag and placed in a box with no protective wrap.  If anyone wants a good plumeria perfume I recommend Auric Blends and Perfumes of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Smells really good very sweet and just like the flower, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Application is basic.  Easy to spill.  Cute plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> delicious fragrance/product</li>
            <li> Became intoxicated by this scent of plumeria on a Hawaiian vacation years ago. I just hope TerraNova continues to formulate and sell it as I don&#x27;t know where else to find it here on the mainland. A little goes a long way and it has a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after taking a trip to Hawaii where they make their lei our of plumeria. This scent really transports me back to that beautiful island. Pretty scent!</li>
            <li> This was the closest to the plumeria flower that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like gardenia.  It&#x27;s not a bad aroma but I thought Plumeria was supposed to smell different than a gardenia bush.  Jury is still out of whether I am going to keep it.  It&#x27;s not the aroma I&#x27;m looking for.  I had bought an incredible perfune from Pusser&#x27;s in the BVI&#x27;s and now they do not sell it anymore.  I&#x27;m trying to find something that is close.  This is not it.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I love Plumeria and since I can&#x27;t get the spray at Bath &amp; Body Works anymore I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative.  This perfume is very strong, even using just a dab, but smells very authentically Plumeria.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Shipped quickly, very satisfied with my experience with this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this because last time I was in Hawaii I bought this type of perfume. I love it and smells just like I expected. The perfume fades after a few hours. I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this......... I feel cheated because I didn&#x27;t know about it.&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance takes you places that you only dream about. Love it! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Please enjoy it !</li>
            <li> A subtle essence of one of the finest floral creations ever made.  The aroma from this product is gentle, sweet and alluring.  You will receive many compliments when you wear this lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this in Hawaii on vacation and found it on Amazon once I was running low. It smells beautiful and is not overwhelming. This little bottle last forever. This is my second one in 3 years.</li>
            <li> Green smell, for my nose it&#x27;s not plumeria((</li>
            <li> My 93 yr old grandmother loves this!</li>
            <li> I love Terra Nota perfumes but I really don&#x27;t want people to know that because I like keeping it my little secret. Haha. Great stuff. Delicious scent. I have tried lots of other perfumes touting island scents and none have ever measured up to Terra Nova&#x27;s quality and fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Whatever this concoction was, it was not frangipani as it was advertised to have been. I have bought frangipani in person from the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, and I still have some left, and there is no comparison between the two. The real frangipani from the Cook Islands has a gentle fragrance that is a joy to smell. By contrast, this concoction has an unbearably heavy smell that lingers on and on and made me run to the nearest pharmacy in search of an aspirin.</li>
            <li> Though this is less than an ounce of perfume, it is in a beautiful little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is sweet and rich, like real plumeria blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;I just put one tiny dot it on one wrist, than rub the other wrist over it.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is just lovely and plenty strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;At this rate, this tiny little bottle of heady fragrance will last a long time.</li>
