            <li>Awesome face cleanser.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels so good!  </li>
            <li>and it smells great</li>
            <li>, now my friends ask me what I use all the time, all great products from Eminence.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that these aren&#x27;t bulky bottles, I believe it helps keep things fresher for your skin!</li>

            <li>All good here.</li>
            <li>Nice face wash- smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>If I were to keep making these kind of product purchases, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them.</li>

            <li>Love this product line.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products, and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Love love love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it as well.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed how long it lasts me</li>
            <li>Great for excessively sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of cleansers and I find this one excellent for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this product is a great moisturizing cleanser and will purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all youladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, yet smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely coconut natural scent, very light and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dissolves eye makeup like a champ and gets my face really clean without drying.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Eminence Coconut Milk Cleanser twice now, and twice it has shown no results, and nothing special to continue justifying the cost.</li>
            <li>All natural, moisturizing cleanser, gentle on the skin, with a great fresh coconut scent.</li>
            <li>That is a huge success for me because he is picky.</li>
            <li>nice cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>Eminence products are first rate in quality -- my skin glows!</li>
            <li>Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and fresh with a youthful appearance, which is pretty amazing since I am nearly 60 year old!</li>
            <li>What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so this product is amazing</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin though......</li>
            <li>i order from the same seller :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products from Oil of Oley to Clinique to Uspa</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it cleanses</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin so this product is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Hoping this remains status quo (sometimes a reaction has occurred for me over time...), so I have a new organic face cleanser!!  </li>
            <li>Super gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>is very hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>Cleanses very well while being gentle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much.</li>
            <li>so if you have very dry skin, it&#x27;ll will be very mild.</li>
            <li>Very moisterising for mature skin !</li>
            <li>is it removes my non-waterproof mascara, so no separate eye makeup remover needed (which is tricky for sensitive eyes)!!  </li>
            <li>A little heavier than the sensitive formula but good overall.</li>
            <li>It goes a long way, you only need a small amount and it smells great and is so gentle and cleansing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is very important since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I bought this face wash for my 12 year old son who is interested in taking care of his skin and is cleansing daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.   </li>
            <li>Plus I love coconut for any beauty product, this Eminence product was the least damaging to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>With the drying winter weather and the indoor heat, this keeps my skin soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but is extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This is supposed to be the eminence product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else compares to it for gentle cleansing with numerous skin benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online, you just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try the entire line!</li>
            <li>I usually use it twice in a row to thoroughly clean my face.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.   </li>
            <li>reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.   </li>

            <li> but i am hoping it was just a bad bottle and may get a better one next time</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s soothing to the skin and has  for me cut  down on the red irritated skin after shaving</li>

            <li> Received as expected.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry after cleansing with it.</li>
            <li> Recommend other Eminence products also.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what the other cleansers would do to my face!&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> but this one had its pump jammed and was not able to make it work.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any dry patches on my skin nor flaking of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I rotate using it with another cleanser as I&#x27;m not sure how well it cleanses.  </li>
            <li> My skin reacts and itches to almost all products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> and it is cold here</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the third one i bought. was very happy with the first 2 but this one had its pump jammed and was not able to make it work. So i have to open the bottle everytime. but i am hoping it was just a bad bottle and may get a better one next time i order from the same seller :)</li>
            <li> love this and it smells great, now my friends ask me what I use all the time, all great products from Eminence. I recommend this product and all their products for everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product!  With the drying winter weather and the indoor heat, this keeps my skin soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I have dry, sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.  For me this is not very moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying either and the best part (fingers crossed) is it removes my non-waterproof mascara, so no separate eye makeup remover needed (which is tricky for sensitive eyes)!!  Hoping this remains status quo (sometimes a reaction has occurred for me over time...), so I have a new organic face cleanser!!  (o:</li>
            <li> I love all eminence products. I have used them for over 5yrs. I have dry skin and the coconut cleanser is very hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention they are one if the greenest companies around.</li>
            <li> Excellent !!  Recommend other Eminence products also.</li>
            <li> Where I live the winter can be harsh on your skin.  I have tried many different facial care products and each has failed in one way or another.  The Eminence collection works.  I purchase this cleanser and I am happy that I did.  I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile now and it is cold here and I have not experienced any dry patches on my skin nor flaking of my skin.  This cleanser is a winner!</li>
            <li> I think this product is a great moisturizing cleanser and will purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> Very moisterising for mature skin !</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, been using it for a couple years now.  It goes a long way, you only need a small amount and it smells great and is so gentle and cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but is extremely sensitive.  I find this calms down my face, but leaves extremely soft.  The smell is an absolute awesome bonus.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this product is amazing I thought it might leave me to oily but it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s amazing for pre shave  wash it&#x27;s soothing to the skin and has  for me cut  down on the red irritated skin after shaving I&#x27;m really impressed how long it lasts me</li>
            <li> Love love this product smells great and leaves my skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  Here are the reasons I don&#x27;t like it:&lt;br /&gt;1.  My face burns after I use it.  This is supposed to be the eminence product for sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the other cleansers would do to my face!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Eminence doesn&#x27;t submit the majority of their products to the EWG Skin Deep Database from what I can see.  They only have four on there out of ALL of their products.  The four that are on there score a 3.  I try to stay at 0-2 with all products I use.  If the 4 they submitted are at a 3, I can&#x27;t imagine what score the others would get...</li>
            <li> Does not remove make up.</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious cleanser. The scent is light. Cleanses very well while being gentle. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now. Nothing else compares to it for gentle cleansing with numerous skin benefits.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and is very gentle on the skin. I usually use it twice in a row to thoroughly clean my face.</li>
            <li> Super gentle on my sensitive skin. Love the way it smells, too.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Gentle, creamy and thick.  I rotate using it with another cleanser as I&#x27;m not sure how well it cleanses.  It is very gentle on my skin though......so if you have very dry skin, it&#x27;ll will be very mild.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hydrating cleanser! You can add Strawberry Rhubarb Exfoliant once a week with it. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This lotion is my night time cleaner, taking off all my makeup including mascara......smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so luxurious on your face! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my face.  Eminence products are first rate in quality -- my skin glows!</li>
            <li> not overpowering in coconut scent.  nice cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s this decadent, silky treat that I get to lather on in the shower.  It smells and feels so good!  Not sure how good it cleanses but it moisturizes well and it luxurious when using...</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I love this milk cleanser!  My skin is quite sensitive, sometimes normal, sometimes a little dry, this products meets my face and neck cleaning needs.  It also has a lovely coconut natural scent, very light and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, try it, you will love it too!</li>
            <li> Love this product line. My skin reacts and itches to almost all products I have tried in the past. This line causes no flare ups and is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Only face wash that doesn&#x27;t  irritate or inflame</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products, and this one is one of my favorites. All natural, moisturizing cleanser, gentle on the skin, with a great fresh coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Nice face wash- smells AMAZING! A little heavier than the sensitive formula but good overall. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and she said she likes the result. The skin is so smooth, glowing refreshed and everything she feels good about this cleanser</li>
            <li> Love love love this cleanser. Dissolves eye makeup like a champ and gets my face really clean without drying.  I have super dry skin so this product is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.   I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes. Mild acne has followed me into adulthood, and even worse, I don&#x27;t leave my skin alone all the time like I should.    I have tried Eminence Coconut Milk Cleanser twice now, and twice it has shown no results, and nothing special to continue justifying the cost. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.   Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products. What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness! I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online, you just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions. It is nice that these aren&#x27;t bulky bottles, I believe it helps keep things fresher for your skin! Plus I love coconut for any beauty product, this Eminence product was the least damaging to my sensitive skin.  If I were to keep making these kind of product purchases, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them. Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.  For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much. I say you have to try it for yourself, reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.   Good luck to all youladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products from Oil of Oley to Clinique to Uspa and I love this product! Eminence is superior to them all. My skin is smooth and fresh with a youthful appearance, which is pretty amazing since I am nearly 60 year old! This is the only product I have truly seen noticeable improvement with. I highly recommend you try the entire line! ~♡♡♡~</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash for my 12 year old son who is interested in taking care of his skin and is cleansing daily. He loves the scent, and the way it makes his skin feel. That is a huge success for me because he is picky. I purchased the Bright Skin Cleanser from this line for myself and I absolutely love it as well. My skin feels clean, yet smooth. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry after cleansing with it. Although I do apply face lotion twice a day as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome face cleanser. Great for excessively sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  All good here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of cleansers and I find this one excellent for my skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is very important since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
