            <li>It fits perfectly, provides the air to me</li>
            <li>it is awesome!</li>
            <li>Thus, when we came across this one, which is an awesome value, we ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>but it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Works great and was a good value compared to what i used to pay.</li>
            <li>Works great and was a good value compared to what i used to pay.</li>
            <li>Best price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid guideline requires more words.&lt;br /&gt;Aardvark.  Aardvark.  </li>
            <li>Still the best CPAP nasal mask available.</li>
            <li>None of us like wearing a mask but this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Great FIT for some -- lack of gel cushion must be considered!</li>
            <li>Nice unit Love it...</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>Quick release connection at the tube a good idea.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>Make SURE to get the CORRECT size.</li>
            <li>and it work pretty good, but still not use to using yet.</li>
            <li>When I saw the design difference of the bridge design in the photos it looked like it would be more comfortable</li>
            <li>Priced well, packaged well and was easy to put together.  </li>
            <li>Fits well, easy to assemble and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>The product was more comfortable than the original.  </li>
            <li>This mask is so light and yet durable.</li>
            <li>okay just doesnt work as good if it properly fit him like his last one.</li>
            <li>Anyone that needs a CPAP or a BiPAP knows that once you find something comfortable, stick with it --- so we have.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I would have been more comfortable and had a better fit if I had known that.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and seals very well.</li>
            <li>I have had the Mirage full face</li>
            <li>Price wise these are always the same wherever you buy.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to dig out a 12 year old Rx and send along as most vendors require.</li>
            <li>When you toss and turn, as I do, the pliable mask and soft plastic bridge piece flexes with you and doesn&#x27;t easily release itself.  </li>
            <li>I have an older HC405 before I bought a Respironics full face CPAP mask.</li>
            <li>, I believe it was more than double</li>
            <li>The HC405 has a foam insert to keep your mask further away from your face and support the mask more under tension.</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder more replacements when needed.</li>
            <li>the nose piece does not stay connected to the headgear---avoid this merchandise---it is c-crap--i plan to ask for a full refund and it has already been replaced with a better (but, more expensive) headgear.</li>
            <li>better than expected, no prescription required...will buy this mask over and over again.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I tried Sleepnet masks and the thick gel was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old one and noticed difference in my sleep right away.</li>
            <li>The price was better than going through my insurance billing and with a lot less hastle.  </li>
            <li>well it is kinda small and they dont come in many sizes</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Ultra Mirage II bridge pieces and most of the nose piece are made of hard plastic.  </li>
            <li>We were accustomed to the soft pliable plastic and the flexibility of the old masks.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll eventually get replacements for our old masks and the replacements will be the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were exactly the same ResMed products that I had received when first starting my CPAP therapy from the medical provider.  </li>
            <li>good price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>(mistake--hard to fit to face), standard, and a shallow standard and then this light standard one.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses a CPAP machine, and without insurance we could not afford a new mask from the medical supply store.  </li>
            <li>Having spent that much money, we both gave it a try and found that it was not to our satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very clear that this is not the standard face mask, but a much smaller variety.  </li>
            <li>Not the MOST comfortable mask Iv&#x27;e ever had, but far FAR from the Worst!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mask is so light and yet durable. I&#x27;ve been using this model for over 5 years and I&#x27;d not be without it. It fits perfectly, provides the air to me so I sleep without feeling like I&#x27;m struggling to breath.</li>
            <li> I have had the Mirage full face (mistake--hard to fit to face), standard, and a shallow standard and then this light standard one.  It wasn&#x27;t very clear that this is not the standard face mask, but a much smaller variety.  It fits and I will use it, but I prefer the slightly larger one.</li>
            <li> I got the mask and it has no headgear. What do I do without a headgear. Why it was not clear. After I got the headgear, I did not even like the mask. It gave me lines on the face. I tried Sleepnet masks and the thick gel was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Ultra Mirage II because I was using the Ultra Mirage I for the past 2 years.  When I saw the design difference of the bridge design in the photos it looked like it would be more comfortable and it promised to allow less leakage of air because of the way you can adjust it.  I purchased two, one for myself and one for my husband, we are both CPAP users.  The masks arrived timely and they were well packaged.  They were considerably more expensive than our last set of masks in fact, I believe it was more than double the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultra Mirage II bridge pieces and most of the nose piece are made of hard plastic.  This is a big change from the UMI (Ultra Mirage I).  We were accustomed to the soft pliable plastic and the flexibility of the old masks.  Having spent that much money, we both gave it a try and found that it was not to our satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you can adjust the angle of the bridge piece it took me long time to find an angle that would keep the rigid nose piece flush to my face.  I found that I was forced to tighten the head straps very, very, snug in order to have a feeling the mask would not lift or gap.  With the UMI, it almost feels that the pillows around the nose pieces are suctioned onto your face.  When you toss and turn, as I do, the pliable mask and soft plastic bridge piece flexes with you and doesn&#x27;t easily release itself.  With the Ultra Mirage II the rigidity of the mask didn&#x27;t allow it to  flex with me, every time I roll over or change position I was forced to use my hands to push the mask back into position.  During the course of the night I keep tightening the straps, readjusting the nose piece and fiddling with the mask.  In the morning face marks from the mask and straps are much worse with the Ultra Mirage II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three nights with the new mask I gave up and went back to my old mask.  My husband has also sworn off the Ultra Mirage II because he cannot get it to work well.  We are both very disappointed and upset that we spent that much money and can&#x27;t use the product.  We&#x27;ll eventually get replacements for our old masks and the replacements will be the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Works great and was a good value compared to what i used to pay. Works great and was a good value compared to what i used to pay.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Did not require Rx so I didn&#x27;t have to dig out a 12 year old Rx and send along as most vendors require. Still the best CPAP nasal mask available. Price wise these are always the same wherever you buy.</li>
            <li> Not the MOST comfortable mask Iv&#x27;e ever had, but far FAR from the Worst!! Keeps slipping a bit on head part.</li>
            <li> Best price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid guideline requires more words.&lt;br /&gt;Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.</li>
            <li> well it is kinda small and they dont come in many sizes is why it gets 3 stars.  My husband usually wears a sm/med but they dont have that size.  It works okay just doesnt work as good if it properly fit him like his last one.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a CPAP for his sleep apnea.  Anyone that needs a CPAP or a BiPAP knows that once you find something comfortable, stick with it --- so we have.</li>
            <li> Nice unit Love it...what else can I say to make the idiot programmers button turn on so I can submi</li>
            <li> it is awesome! better than expected, no prescription required...will buy this mask over and over again.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> None of us like wearing a mask but this is a good one. I wore it for a year before I realized it came in four different sizes. Clearly, I would have been more comfortable and had a better fit if I had known that. Find out what size you need from the ResMed site before ordering.</li>
            <li> The product was more comfortable than the original.  Priced well, packaged well and was easy to put together.  Quick release connection at the tube a good idea.</li>
            <li> My wife uses a CPAP machine, and without insurance we could not afford a new mask from the medical supply store.  Thus, when we came across this one, which is an awesome value, we ordered it.  The wife loves how it fits her face and how it seals.</li>
            <li> This oparticular mask did not work well for me. The mask is OK, there is nothing wrong with it, it just did not fit me well. I decided to keep it in case I need a back up mask in case the one I use brakes or get damage.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I have tried many others and this is by far the best one.  It is very comfortable and seals very well.</li>
            <li> the nose piece does not stay connected to the headgear---avoid this merchandise---it is c-crap--i plan to ask for a full refund and it has already been replaced with a better (but, more expensive) headgear. you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have an older HC405 before I bought a Respironics full face CPAP mask. I should have bought another HC405. The HC405 has a foam insert to keep your mask further away from your face and support the mask more under tension.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Yahoo for offering these ResMed replacement products!  I ordered them on a Tuesday and they arrived by Friday.  They were exactly the same ResMed products that I had received when first starting my CPAP therapy from the medical provider.  The price was better than going through my insurance billing and with a lot less hastle.  I will definitely reorder more replacements when needed.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying from the ? Insurance Company. and it work pretty good, but still not use to using yet.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work with my husbands machine but it worked great.  The hose and parts all matched up.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Got as an extra for my husband. Fits well, easy to assemble and easy to adjust. good price can&#x27;t go wrong. Must buy headgear separately.</li>
            <li> This works perfect for me. I replaced my old one and noticed difference in my sleep right away. I would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Great FIT for some -- lack of gel cushion must be considered! Make SURE to get the CORRECT size. I have used Respronic mask prior to this and appreciate the softer gel cushion (blue).</li>
