            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any cream for strecht marks while I was pregnant, because I was more concerned about my baby that my look, so I got a ton of strecht marks</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that I bought numerous creams to prevent stretch marks and nothing seemed satisfying!!</li>
            <li>very useful to me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since 27 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product since I was 4 months pregnant.  </li>
            <li>While I was pregnant</li>
            <li>so I give thanks to this product!!</li>
            <li>After using a whole bottle my marks are significantly lighter in color.</li>
            <li>and I was scared to get more with my second pregancy!</li>
            <li>I am very leased!</li>
            <li>and I used it in the first one as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>;) I&#x27;m really prone to stretch marks</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a easy absorb lotion/cream stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li>I use them (still pregnant) immediately after shower while skin is soft and moist.</li>
            <li>: I have lots of huge and deep stretch marks on my breast</li>
            <li>Thanks Clarins.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream through my whole pregnancy</li>
            <li>and it really worked it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it go on smoothly, its not greasy</li>
            <li>I used it twice a  day  during my pregnancy for 9 months every day I spent 200 $ or  a bit more for 4 bottles</li>
            <li>The combination of Clarins Stretch Mark Control and Clarins Body Treatment Oil (Tonic) works beautifully together in prevention of stretch mark due to pregnancy, I&#x27;ve used in my first, second, and third pregnancy and NO ONE stretch mark had appear!!!</li>
            <li>Product was brand new in a box, came as promised!</li>
            <li>If I used it earlier, it should be better, I&#x27;m concluding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, in average i was using it about only once a day, 5 minutes massaging along with the cream and oil before sleeping, maybe twice a day is more helping.</li>
            <li>My skin was so tight, I thought for sure I would have some.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product for new moms and for new stretch marks in your body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>First with treatment oil, i apply about 1.5 quarter size on my big-o belly and all the way to back of waist, and use about 0.5 quarter size on both busts.  </li>
            <li>Now I complete 35 weeks pregnancy</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have streach marks so far.  </li>
            <li>These are old or something.</li>
            <li>Im now 38 weeks and still with the second set of these, yes, they are very pricy</li>
            <li>So I decided to switch to this one, which was more expensive, but worth to try based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both of them have very light, natural scent, fast absorbent, unlike Mustella Double Action and Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter which I&#x27;ve also tried during my second pregnancy, both of them were greasy, poor absorbency, also had stronger scent which were too much for my sensitive pregnancy nose to bear, I end up tossed the unused portion and switchback to Clarins.</li>
            <li>After taking a shower, I applied the Clirins oil first, and then applied this product every single day.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t work in the older ones.   </li>
            <li>Second, i massage stretch mark control in small circular motion with tips of finger for about 3-5 minutes, sometimes more, and let dry before putting clothes on.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product since 27 weeks pregnant.  I was using the stretch mark oil and it left a mess on my clothes.  The Clarins stretch mark control lotion/cream is so easy to absorb and it leaves a very comfortable feeling on my skin.  Not sure if it will help on the stretch mark since I haven&#x27;t seen any yet and I am almost 32 weeks.  My sister just had a baby and she did not have stretch mark.  I hope it runs in the family.  Overall, I like this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a easy absorb lotion/cream stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li> I started to use Clarins Strech Mark Control with 12 weeks pregnancy. Now I complete 35 weeks pregnancy and I don&#x27;t have stretch marks at all.    I will keeping using after the delivery.    Thanks Clarins.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Lightweight, non-greasy, easy to apply  Cons:  Does not prevent/control stretch marks.    I started using this product since I was 4 months pregnant.  Stretch marks started appearing on my lower belly from 6 months onwards.  The product did not prevent stretch marks from appearing and does not seem to be doing anything to help them disappear either.  It&#x27;s just an over-priced body lotion.</li>
            <li> very good! my wife love it!</li>
            <li> I am 37 weeks of pregnancy and I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark on my belly. After taking a shower, I applied the Clirins oil first, and then applied this product every single day.&lt;br /&gt;It really works.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product for a good price.I have been using this cream through my whole pregnancy and i don&#x27;t have streach marks so far.  Good seller, fast shipping. Product was brand new in a box, came as promised!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any cream for strecht marks while I was pregnant, because I was more concerned about my baby that my look, so I got a ton of strecht marks and then I bought this cream because I&#x27;ve been using Clarins for years on my face and with only one bottle almost all my strect marks are gone. I couln&#x27;t belive it, I&#x27;m buying the second one and I will use it for ever. My problem was so bad that I didn&#x27;t even want to look myself at the mirror, but now I can&#x27;t stop doing it, because it is such a big difference.</li>
            <li> I used it several times, I hope it works.&lt;br /&gt;the only small inadequance is that when i used it I smelled some alcohol favor. I am worried about if it is not good for the baby in my body ?</li>
            <li> I have my second baby and a friend gave me this cream as a gift and it really worked it. After delivery I got a few stretch marks but now since I am using this cream they are gone. Like an eraser!! The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t work in the older ones.   I really recommend this product for new moms and for new stretch marks in your body.</li>
            <li> I used another brand until 8 month, the stretch mark just kept growing. So I decided to switch to this one, which was more expensive, but worth to try based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m due in about 2 weeks now and my stretch marks was heavier, but my feeling is that it works and reduced the growth rate of my stretch marks. If I used it earlier, it should be better, I&#x27;m concluding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, in average i was using it about only once a day, 5 minutes massaging along with the cream and oil before sleeping, maybe twice a day is more helping.</li>
            <li> I start using it around month 33 when i already have stretch mark under belly button. i kind of hoping it would stop after i apply this product. but it is not. i regret to say that this is not a product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I got horrible stretch marks with my first baby and I was scared to get more with my second pregancy! Trust me when I say that I bought numerous creams to prevent stretch marks and nothing seemed satisfying!! They were either greasy or they did not subsize my itxhiness.I finally came across clarins stretch mark control and I just want to say that this cream is the best!! Not only does it go on smoothly, its not greasy and I did not get one stretch mark!!! Must I say that I say also applied bio oil ;) I&#x27;m really prone to stretch marks so I give thanks to this product!! I also want to add that this product made my old stretch marks look better!!! I am very leased!</li>
            <li> I started using this at about 17 weeks and continued after I gave birth to my twin boys at 35 weeks. I do not have any strech marks, PERIOD. My skin was so tight, I thought for sure I would have some. I applied morning and night and used 2 tubes.</li>
            <li> These are old or something. They coagulate as you put them on your skin. Horrible, should not be sold to the public in such a misleading manner. We bought the same product at the airport and the quality/freshness is night and day.</li>
            <li> While it is impossible to say whether a cream actually prevents or reduces stretch marks, I religiously used this while pregnant, and two weeks after delivery I am still using. I find it non greasy non fragrant and quality.</li>
            <li> While it is impossible to say whether a cream actually prevents or reduces stretch marks, I religiously used this while pregnant, and two weeks after delivery I am still using. I find it non greasy non fragrant and quality. I will keep using it till I am back in shape!</li>
            <li> good!! very useful to me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I want to recommend this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;the color is very great apparently.</li>
            <li> Previously, I have used this product which purchased at Singapore DFS by a friend. Till the 8th month since my pregnancy, I saw no stretch mark!Quite helpful! Then i decided to buy another one at Amazon. Unfortunately i found the diffenrence from the two. Same package, but it seems this one has diffrent odor frocm the previous one i used. I think this is strange and i won&#x27;t buy any cosmetics through internet in the future!</li>
            <li> i think there is good.hople the next time can be best .I don&#x27;t have any thing to talk about .so so so so. So so so so so so so so</li>
            <li> I started using this product after I gave birth to my baby girl. While I was pregnant I used coca butter and got stretch marks anyway. After using a whole bottle my marks are significantly lighter in color. But color fades eventually over time anyways. what I am most impressed with is that it has actually helped repair the marks from the inside too. When I feel my marks with my finger the \\&quot;indent\\&quot; so to speak feels A LOT smaller; like they&#x27;re filling in. I bet it I had used this product from the beginning I could have avoided getting the marks all together.</li>
            <li> the fragrance of this cream smells good and i like the feeling of patting it onto my belly, ha ha...</li>
            <li> I used it twice a  day  during my pregnancy for 9 months every day I spent 200 $ or  a bit more for 4 bottles The Result: I have lots of huge and deep stretch marks on my breast and they weren&#x27;t grow a lot during pregnancy just from B to C</li>
            <li> The combination of Clarins Stretch Mark Control and Clarins Body Treatment Oil (Tonic) works beautifully together in prevention of stretch mark due to pregnancy, I&#x27;ve used in my first, second, and third pregnancy and NO ONE stretch mark had appear!!! I use them (still pregnant) immediately after shower while skin is soft and moist. First with treatment oil, i apply about 1.5 quarter size on my big-o belly and all the way to back of waist, and use about 0.5 quarter size on both busts.  Treatment oil serves as a base coat that makes application of stretch mark control REAL easy, and much less when used alone. Second, i massage stretch mark control in small circular motion with tips of finger for about 3-5 minutes, sometimes more, and let dry before putting clothes on. Im now 38 weeks and still with the second set of these, yes, they are very pricy so I use them ONLY ONCE a day instead of suggested &amp;#34;once morning and night&amp;#34;. Both of them have very light, natural scent, fast absorbent, unlike Mustella Double Action and Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter which I&#x27;ve also tried during my second pregnancy, both of them were greasy, poor absorbency, also had stronger scent which were too much for my sensitive pregnancy nose to bear, I end up tossed the unused portion and switchback to Clarins. A friend of mine used the same set for her pregnancy years ago, but didn&#x27;t work for her, Im not sure if she&#x27;d massaged them in or just simply worn them like ordinary lotion... But these works for me BEAUTIFULLY!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second pregnancy and I used it in the first one as well.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin feel very soft. I also use the clarins tonic oil as a complement. No stretch marks appeared.</li>
