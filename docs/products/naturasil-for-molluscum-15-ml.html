            <li>company was great to work with no complaints!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>This works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>This worked great for my son.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Until we found this wonderful product, she&#x27;s been using it for 2 weeks now, and her legs are almost clean!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>ItÂ´s good</li>
            <li>We are very pleased.</li>
            <li>It Wonderful, and haven&#x27;t had a break out since I was first found out</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic!</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor, but works great</li>
            <li>Amazing treatment for our daughter</li>
            <li>Virus is supposed to disappear on its own within 6 months to 1 year.</li>
            <li>It has  a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It also has a very strong scent that lurks, it made my stomach turn at times.  </li>
            <li>She \\&quot;encouraged\\&quot; me saying that if it doesn&#x27;t clear up, we&#x27;d be able to freeze them off when she is six or seven!!!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly have bought most of the meds.</li>
            <li>use Compound-W applied with a q-tip with the cotton removed just to the top of the bump.</li>
            <li>but u have to make sure to use it 3 times a day of not it might not work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.  </li>
            <li>But after reading many forums on homeopathic remedies I came across this, which suprisingly didn&#x27;t show up when I searched for products specifically to treat molluscum.</li>
            <li>Bactroban Cream works much better.</li>
            <li>I should be putting it on him more</li>
            <li>I used another product that was more effective and cost more, but was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have very young children, this may be a great product for them.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, in that it was easy to apply, but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort, although the smell was a bit strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a really strong odor, but my son doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li>I saw amazing results from this product within the first week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a different product which works great.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and is pain free!</li>
            <li>available on Amazon to treat it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!!</li>
            <li>I was very diligent about applying the medicine, and I kind of massaged it in to each bump to really make sure it penetrated, but it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase Dermisil on Amazon and after 2 weeks of use (3x per day), my daughter&#x27;s Molluscum legions were significantly reduced in size and quantity.  </li>
            <li>The first week I applied it 2x a day, after that just 1x a day for  2 more weeks.</li>
            <li>pleasant small and nice applicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the redness will fade over time, but it really does look a lot better</li>
            <li>Nice natural way to use for the pesky molluscum for my 12 yo.</li>
            <li>She was becoming more aware of the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; and self conscious, so I started looking for treatments even though our pediatrician told us there wasn&#x27;t anything available to treat it (the body would eventually do it,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine product and is worth trying for anyone in our same situation.</li>
            <li>The doctors/dermatologist says it would go away on its own, but one of them got infected on the back of my daughter&#x27;s leg.</li>
            <li>But for the price, and knowing it worked on my son, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I found this product after a great deal of searching and reading about various remedies to treat my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s molluscum contagiosum.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural and contains no steroids.</li>
            <li>it was worth a try</li>
            <li>they love to share, and apparently molluscum is no exception.</li>
            <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t experience any side effects (dry skin, etc.) and liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a dancer, swimmer, and a runner and had her first case of molluscum 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>However the smell is very potent and the brush applicator is too soft to properly apply and work in the medicine around a bump.</li>
            <li>Within three days, her bumps were looking much better, and three weeks after starting treatment, all of the bumps were gone.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried condylox, candida injections, beetlejuice, and most recently tried going the homeopathic route.</li>
            <li>This prescription treatment only inflamed healthy skin while doing nothing to the Molluscum legions.  </li>
            <li>, she had several on her knees and within a week most of them were gone.  </li>
            <li>I spilled the bottle and I am ordering more, but if it keeps up, they will be gone within the next two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate this correctly right now as the prescribed time frame hasn&#x27;t been reached yet.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old had a mild (but worsening) case of molluscum.  </li>
            <li>but it really works</li>
            <li>Has worked very well in clearing up my son&#x27;s molluscum.</li>
            <li>This product really funcional.  </li>
            <li>We went through the whole bottle and It didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I really wish I could have said otherwise</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this worked for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for the Molluscum.  </li>
            <li>It didnt really works for my kids.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li>After only using this product for 6 days, I am almost completely molluscum free!</li>
            <li>Also, if you can safely pop the bigger ones with something sterilized (I used the flat back of tweezers, boiled), making sure you remove</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the product is speeding up the process of the moscullum going away, but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>i looked for natural remedy first and tried this&lt;br /&gt;http://www.frugalityisfree.com/2011/06/apple-cider-vinegar-molluscum.html</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE to only use it on one person and also don&#x27;t touch the Molluscum with the applicator and then put it back in the bottle.</li>
            <li>If you have older kids, try Poxiderm...worked wonders for us.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and hopefully this nightmare will be over in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>and then we started seeing new bumps on her body.  </li>
            <li>Within one day of treating, we stopped seeing new bumps.  </li>
            <li>Cleared up molluscum on my four year old very quickly when other remedies did not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely gone!  </li>
            <li>My daughter had been suffering from molluscum for several months, she tried many remedies with no success.</li>
            <li>My daugther of 4 years old had molluscon.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter gutter had molluscum fir two years.</li>
            <li>and now my daughter isn&#x27;t self conscious to wear shorts and bathing suits.</li>
            <li>So far this is doing the job</li>
            <li>I purchased this a month ago for my five year old who has molloscum on her chin.  </li>
            <li>but it just smells like natural deoderant so its not embarrassing.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist said if she was older, or the bumps were not on such a sensitive area, she would freeze them off, but said that that wasn&#x27;t an option on such a young child.  </li>
            <li>and this product actually would  have done something to help with my 4 year old son molluscum problem.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has 20 open wounds on each leg...</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it gives you a slight burning sensation like its doing something.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and minus the scarring from the scratching, her skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li>So far, no new bumps have appeared.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and minus the scarring from the scratching, her skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> So far, no new bumps have appeared.</li>
            <li> It is painless and clear which was a big plus compared to other similar medicines.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable how fast this worked.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be shrinking the flat wart on my face though.</li>
            <li> but it could take as long as 18 months).  </li>
            <li> we have not been using it as regularly as we should (partially because of the stinging factor).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a slight redness similar to when a scab heals but it&#x27;s only been about six weeks since we started treatment.</li>
            <li> My daughter was burned with treatments several times, and after the first few times I applied this product I noticed the molluscum were drying out, she has less and less</li>
            <li> Within 3 days the bump patches began to dry up and flatten.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get too much of it on unaffected skin because the unaffected skin might become irritated after 4wks.</li>
            <li> In addition to this product and vinegar - the bumps have definitely gone down...</li>
            <li> They start by getting red and a little irritated</li>
            <li> We spent 9 months and hundreds of dollars dealing with this before finding this treatment.  </li>
            <li> Received as expected.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of use the only thing burning is the hole in my pocket from wasting my money.</li>
            <li> We tried this product and followed the directions faithfully for a month with absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I initially treated my daughter&#x27;s Molluscum for 3 months with harsh creams prescribed by a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> We tried this product after multiple failures to include dermatologist treatment and chemical burns; The application of Naturasil in combination with cleaning the area with  tea tree soap and application of tea tree oil to keep the area moisturized our granddaughter finally is clean of molluscum ( should be mentioned that hundreds of dollars were spent for the last 12 months on other alternative treatments as well as prescriptions and worthless &amp;#34;specialized&amp;#34; dermatology consults).</li>
            <li> She told me to treat every other day with a prescription of Retin-A and on the alternating days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it on my other two children....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to look into other treatments.</li>
            <li> but I hope it will help other kids or adults that have this problem.</li>
            <li> this still stings like the other stuff we have tried.</li>
            <li> They looked pretty red and awful during treatment, but after four weeks of use they were completely gone!!!!</li>
            <li> By the second week half of them were gone and the really bad ones are healing quickly.  </li>
            <li> I took her back to the pediatrician when it was still there, and getting worse, three months later.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist just said to treat less often. . . .</li>
            <li> Cleared up in less than 1 week after lancing.</li>
            <li> perhaps it stings less.</li>
            <li> I started following the regime that she prescribed, but it was VERY hard on my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> There were isolated little bumps on both arms, a few on her abdomen and even a couple on her genital area.  </li>
            <li> It did not burn or sting - even on broken skin (the molluscum become little rupturing pustules that look like pimples - so gross), so you can treat bumps in any stage without it hurting.  </li>
            <li> It still takes a few weeks to work.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This made a noticeable difference within a Few days.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would happen again due to the location of the bumps on back of her leg.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started putting this on them, they went down in size and disappeared after a couple days!!</li>
            <li> To know I could have been rid of it in less than a month for less than $40 is so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using this little bottle of miracle, her molluscum went away!!  </li>
            <li> We did it at least 2 times a day for 2 weeks and nothing changed.</li>
            <li> - At least as an OPTION to try.</li>
            <li> She looked terrible and everything we were doing seemed to be making it worse, so in the middle of the night one night I ordered three different homeopathic remedies off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> No change at all and was so expensive, waste of money.</li>
            <li> although very slow.</li>
            <li> At that time the pediatrician agreed that it was getting worse and suggested that I should see the dermatologist about what we might do.  </li>
            <li> Seems to make it worse (comes to the surface).  </li>
            <li> His twin has them on his butt and have been using it on him and they seem to be getting worse.</li>
            <li> but when this has been around for a year I can wait another 1-2 months esp as u see results within 2 weeks (ie flaking, decreased size).</li>
            <li> My two year old had TERRIBLE molluscum all over the underside of her chin.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend based on this.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Meh if you have this go see a doctor these home remdies are useless as hell</li>
            <li> I was hopeful upon finding this product, but unfortunately after 3 weeks of use we saw no change in her condition.</li>
            <li> used Zymaderm for a couple months and my son&#x27;s molloscum spread all over and got way worse!  </li>
            <li> I know you can be desperate to try anything but</li>
            <li> keep looking this is not the solution, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Well, it went badly.  </li>
            <li> Smelled bad</li>
            <li> the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible!</li>
            <li> It was awful!</li>
            <li> , it pigmented her skin and it smelled horrible!</li>

            <li> My friend tried this product and she said it worked . i looked for natural remedy first and tried this&lt;br /&gt;http://www.frugalityisfree.com/2011/06/apple-cider-vinegar-molluscum.html&lt;br /&gt;one should have patience for this but it really works</li>
            <li> My daughter is a dancer, swimmer, and a runner and had her first case of molluscum 3 months ago. I tried everything and nothing worked. Then I purchased Nutrasil. Let me say.....the smell is horrible. I used it twice a day. Within 3 days the bump patches began to dry up and flatten. So far, no new bumps have appeared. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and minus the scarring from the scratching, her skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> like the smell, but did not yet see the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to treat my son and daughter&#x27;s molluscum, ages 2 and 6.  This one seems to work the best.  It still takes a few weeks to work.  I also have tried coconut oil and that seems to also help with the healing and it keeps them at bay once they are gone.  I&#x27;ve done trial and error and it&#x27;s true!  Also, if you can safely pop the bigger ones with something sterilized (I used the flat back of tweezers, boiled), making sure you remove just the white part and alcohol wipe that area once you do, it heals even faster.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with daughters molluscum.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Has worked very well in clearing up my son&#x27;s molluscum.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with genital warts and couldn&#x27;t afford the medicine that the doctor had prescribed for me.  I use this for my genital warts whenever I do have a breakout, and its wonderful.  Just put some on a cotton ball or maybe a tampon if you&#x27;re a female and use daily and you will see it disappear.  It Wonderful, and haven&#x27;t had a break out since I was first found out I had them, and that was 5 years ago.  Good Luck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Moscullum since August. I never got treatment for it because it wasn&#x27;t visible to anyone but me and it didn&#x27;t hurt. It got unsightly in December so I purchased this item. Virus is supposed to disappear on its own within 6 months to 1 year. The bumps started disappearing within a matter of days after using this product. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is speeding up the process of the moscullum going away, but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ll write a review again post treatment.</li>
            <li> This product really funcional.  My daugther of 4 years old had molluscon.  I bought this product and she havenÂ´t only one.  ItÂ´s good</li>
            <li> The problem with this product is it must be applied 2-3 times daily. We did it at least 2 times a day for 2 weeks and nothing changed. I can&#x27;t work that frequency into our routine. Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend based on this.</li>
            <li> Cleared up molluscum on my four year old very quickly when other remedies did not work. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible! It actually made my son&#x27;s molluscum spread and worsen...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate this correctly right now as the prescribed time frame hasn&#x27;t been reached yet. It does seem to be shrinking the flat wart on my face though.</li>
            <li> It is painless and clear which was a big plus compared to other similar medicines. However the smell is very potent and the brush applicator is too soft to properly apply and work in the medicine around a bump.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> We went through the whole bottle and It didn&#x27;t help at all. It has  a very strong smell. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I know you can be desperate to try anything but keep looking this is not the solution, I&#x27;m afraid. I really wish I could have said otherwise and this product actually would  have done something to help with my 4 year old son molluscum problem. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!! My daughter had been suffering from molluscum for several months, she tried many remedies with no success.Until we found this wonderful product, she&#x27;s been using it for 2 weeks now, and her legs are almost clean!! She&#x27;s  very happy to see the results</li>
            <li> It did not work. I&#x27;m using a different product which works great. Sorry</li>
            <li> My two year old had TERRIBLE molluscum all over the underside of her chin.  We were told by the pediatrician not to do anything about it and her immune system would get rid of it eventually.  I took her back to the pediatrician when it was still there, and getting worse, three months later.  At that time the pediatrician agreed that it was getting worse and suggested that I should see the dermatologist about what we might do.  The dermatologist said if she was older, or the bumps were not on such a sensitive area, she would freeze them off, but said that that wasn&#x27;t an option on such a young child.  She told me to treat every other day with a prescription of Retin-A and on the alternating days use Compound-W applied with a q-tip with the cotton removed just to the top of the bump. She warned me that it could take several months to get the bumps to go away, and in some cases they could actually battle it for YEARS.  She \\&quot;encouraged\\&quot; me saying that if it doesn&#x27;t clear up, we&#x27;d be able to freeze them off when she is six or seven!!!!! I started following the regime that she prescribed, but it was VERY hard on my baby&#x27;s skin and I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was making any difference in the molluscum.  I called the dermatologist a few weeks in and told her that my baby&#x27;s skin was very irritated and that she cried and told me that the medicine burned every time I tried to treat her.  The dermatologist just said to treat less often. . . . Retin-A every three days or so and Compound-W twice a week and see how that went. . . . Well, it went badly.  The molluscum started spreading.  It was moving up on to her face and then we started seeing new bumps on her body.  There were isolated little bumps on both arms, a few on her abdomen and even a couple on her genital area.  I was desperate.  She looked terrible and everything we were doing seemed to be making it worse, so in the middle of the night one night I ordered three different homeopathic remedies off Amazon.  This was the firstthat arrived and it worked a MIRACLE for us.  Within one day of treating, we stopped seeing new bumps.  Within three days, her bumps were looking much better, and three weeks after starting treatment, all of the bumps were gone.  I was very diligent about applying the medicine, and I kind of massaged it in to each bump to really make sure it penetrated, but it was easy to use.  It did not burn or sting - even on broken skin (the molluscum become little rupturing pustules that look like pimples - so gross), so you can treat bumps in any stage without it hurting.  We spent 9 months and hundreds of dollars dealing with this before finding this treatment.  To know I could have been rid of it in less than a month for less than $40 is so frustrating.  Why do doctors not tell us about this stuff??? - At least as an OPTION to try.</li>
            <li> Great but u have to make sure to use it 3 times a day of not it might not work</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  Happy customer!</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it gives you a slight burning sensation like its doing something.  But after a few weeks of use the only thing burning is the hole in my pocket from wasting my money.</li>
            <li> It seems to work although very slow. pleasant small and nice applicator.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter gutter had molluscum fir two years. The doctors/dermatologist says it would go away on its own, but one of them got infected on the back of my daughter&#x27;s leg. The dermatologist had to lance it and drain it while my daughter screamed. It was awful! Then she had to be put on antibiotics. I was afraid this would happen again due to the location of the bumps on back of her leg. That&#x27;s when I found this product. We started using it about 3, sometimes four times a day. Within a week, I could see that it was working. The size of the molluscums were shrinking. Within a couple weeks, they were drying up and getting my crusty and falling off like a scab. They looked pretty red and awful during treatment, but after four weeks of use they were completely gone!!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. There&#x27;s still a slight redness similar to when a scab heals but it&#x27;s only been about six weeks since we started treatment. I&#x27;m guessing the redness will fade over time, but it really does look a lot better and now my daughter isn&#x27;t self conscious to wear shorts and bathing suits. I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to people I know.</li>
            <li> I have two kids with molluscum. This worked great for my son. His warts are almost gone, and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. It did not work for my daughter, though. We will need to try something else, as hers have spread. But for the price, and knowing it worked on my son, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It just took longer than the instructions said it would.</li>
            <li> 2 months later and still no difference on my daughters molluscum but it hasnt spread anywhere else either so...we&#x27;re still using it. Might try a more expensive product next time if still no change in a month.</li>
            <li> May have worked for others but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I would suggest just spending the money getting molluscum removed at the hospital. None of these topical treatments on the Internet don&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old had a mild (but worsening) case of molluscum.  We were about 4 months into the diagnosis when it started to spread from her neck to her back and face.  She was becoming more aware of the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; and self conscious, so I started looking for treatments even though our pediatrician told us there wasn&#x27;t anything available to treat it (the body would eventually do it, but it could take as long as 18 months).  Within 2 weeks of using this little bottle of miracle, her molluscum went away!!  It&#x27;s completely gone!  It was unbelievable how fast this worked.  My daughter didn&#x27;t experience any side effects (dry skin, etc.) and liked the smell.  We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> Meh if you have this go see a doctor these home remdies are useless as hell</li>
            <li> We tried this product after multiple failures to include dermatologist treatment and chemical burns; The application of Naturasil in combination with cleaning the area with  tea tree soap and application of tea tree oil to keep the area moisturized our granddaughter finally is clean of molluscum ( should be mentioned that hundreds of dollars were spent for the last 12 months on other alternative treatments as well as prescriptions and worthless &amp;#34;specialized&amp;#34; dermatology consults).</li>
            <li> I found this product after a great deal of searching and reading about various remedies to treat my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s molluscum contagiosum. I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end and will try just about anything within reason. We&#x27;ve tried condylox, candida injections, beetlejuice, and most recently tried going the homeopathic route. I was hopeful upon finding this product, but unfortunately after 3 weeks of use we saw no change in her condition. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine product and is worth trying for anyone in our same situation. It didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort, although the smell was a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed in my third trimester of pregnancy with molluscum, something i had never heard of before. After 6 months of cryotherapy and salicylic acid treatment I was beginning to lose hope. But after reading many forums on homeopathic remedies I came across this, which suprisingly didn&#x27;t show up when I searched for products specifically to treat molluscum. After only using this product for 6 days, I am almost completely molluscum free! This stuff is like magic! I would highly recommend it. It smells fresh and is pain free! I applied 3-4 times daily.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has a number of molluscum bump on her legs and bum.  We tried this product and followed the directions faithfully for a month with absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> Seems to make it worse (comes to the surface).  Bactroban Cream works much better.</li>
            <li> I initially treated my daughter&#x27;s Molluscum for 3 months with harsh creams prescribed by a dermatologist.  This prescription treatment only inflamed healthy skin while doing nothing to the Molluscum legions.  I decided to purchase Dermisil on Amazon and after 2 weeks of use (3x per day), my daughter&#x27;s Molluscum legions were significantly reduced in size and quantity.  After 45 days of use, her legions appeared to be gone.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this worked for my daughter.  Not only that, it pigmented her skin and it smelled horrible!</li>
            <li> So far this is doing the job and we are very happy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Go to a Dr. and get them taken care of.  Save your money</li>
            <li> My despair finally found an end. My daughter was burned with treatments several times, and after the first few times I applied this product I noticed the molluscum were drying out, she has less and less and hopefully this nightmare will be over in a few more weeks. As I heard amongst friends, it works for some, doesn&#x27;t for others but it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> No change at all and was so expensive, waste of money. I tied to find a contact number for the maker of this product and it is no where to be found.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for the Molluscum.  After researching, trying 2 different meds and going to the dermatologist twice, I ended up lancing the molluscum with a sanitized needle and squeezing the white &amp;#34;virus&amp;#34; out.  Cleared up in less than 1 week after lancing.</li>
            <li> This made a noticeable difference within a Few days. I was amazed. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell but it&#x27;s not so bothersome that it keeps me from using it. A great product.</li>
            <li> My son had molluscum around his chest, arms and back. After using this product it has all cleared up. The first week I applied it 2x a day, after that just 1x a day for  2 more weeks. I&#x27;m happy!!!! :)</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has 20 open wounds on each leg... like mosquito bites that he&#x27;s scratched until they bleed.  In addition to this product and vinegar - the bumps have definitely gone down... but I cannot write it&#x27;s solely because of this product.</li>
            <li> Our son had it in his armpit and along his side and within a couple of months they were all gone. They start by getting red and a little irritated but then you can see them get smaller and smaller. His twin has them on his butt and have been using it on him and they seem to be getting worse. Im thinking its because they shared the bottle. MAKE SURE to only use it on one person and also don&#x27;t touch the Molluscum with the applicator and then put it back in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who had a couple on his leg. As soon as I started putting this on them, they went down in size and disappeared after a couple days!! If recomend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Amazing treatment for our daughter, she had several on her knees and within a week most of them were gone.  It does have a strong odor, but works great</li>
            <li> It didnt really works for my kids.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I used another product that was more effective and cost more, but was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company was great to work with no complaints!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, so I gave it a try when my son&#x27;s bumps began to spread. I&#x27;m not using it on my other two children....they love to share, and apparently molluscum is no exception. This works beautifully.</li>
            <li> We just purchased this product and have been using on my son. I love the fact that it is natural and contains no steroids. We have seen a noticeable improvement. I definitely recommend this product and 5 stars is well deserved.</li>
            <li> Tried the product as directed and saw no improvement.  I would not recommend this produce as you might as well just wait for the molluscum to go away.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for my MCV</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to work at clearing up my daughter&#x27;smolluscum.  It did sort of help with the itch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a month ago for my five year old who has molloscum on her chin.  The box says to apply 3-4 times a day for 2-6 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it since I bought it and I still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. It also has a very strong scent that lurks, it made my stomach turn at times.  it was worth a try but I&#x27;m going to look into other treatments.</li>
            <li> Note: I ordered from this site and received Naturasil: Molluscum Contagiosum.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference.  The labels look the same, but the brand is different (Dermasil vs Naturasil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Zymaderm for a couple months and my son&#x27;s molloscum spread all over and got way worse!  I saw amazing results from this product within the first week.  By the second week half of them were gone and the really bad ones are healing quickly.  I spilled the bottle and I am ordering more, but if it keeps up, they will be gone within the next two weeks.  I&#x27;ve also only been putting it on once a day.  I should be putting it on him more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a really strong odor, but my son doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> It is taking some time, but the smaller ones have started to go...</li>
            <li> Got rid of some. Took forever.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my daughter&#x27;s mc. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference in my daughter&#x27;s case but I hope it will help other kids or adults that have this problem.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to work (4-8 weeks) but when this has been around for a year I can wait another 1-2 months esp as u see results within 2 weeks (ie flaking, decreased size). It does have a strong smell but it just smells like natural deoderant so its not embarrassing. I&#x27;m on my second bottle because I applied it continuously but its still cheaper than $20 co pays for dermatologist. Just be careful not to get too much of it on unaffected skin because the unaffected skin might become irritated after 4wks.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous kinds do medicine for my sons Molluscum.  I honestly have bought most of the meds. available on Amazon to treat it.  This is a good product, in that it was easy to apply, but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement after weeks of use.  If you have very young children, this may be a great product for them.  It is gentle on skin.  If you have older kids, try Poxiderm...worked wonders for us.</li>
            <li> Nice natural way to use for the pesky molluscum for my 12 yo. Be patient- took several months of every day application. But it worked.</li>
            <li> this still stings like the other stuff we have tried. perhaps it stings less. we have had no changes yet and have been using this for about 2 weeks.  we have not been using it as regularly as we should (partially because of the stinging factor).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Smelled bad</li>
