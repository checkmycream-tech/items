    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>\\&quot;Zoom Party\\&quot; was very good about processing our return and refund.  </li>
            <li>This product is safe (it received a 1 rating from EWG, 0 being best) and works at protecting my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>have never had a problem with the makers of SunStuff, Purple Prairie Botanicals; they have always offered great customer service to me.  </li>
            <li>This is good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trust my fair skin in the sun with nothing but this product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how it stayed on and was not oily at all.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried over a dozen so-called healthy sunscreens, but this one is really good.</li>
            <li>product that does more harm than good in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>And if your skin is not used to that kind of sun exposure</li>
            <li>This is by far the best organid zinc oxide sunscreen I have used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with it and will buy another bottle once mine runs out.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>HI, I was pleased with this product purchase, however it does sting when it gets in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased and used this sunscreen in 2012, so maybe the formula is better, because I did not have any problems with my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It had great reviews from EWG and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is good.  </li>
            <li>This product was listed on Safemama.com as super safe for kids.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to rub in but overall it is great.</li>
            <li>The product is not greasy and has a mild scent (it smells like what you would expect a sunscreen to smell like).</li>
            <li>I am Italian, do not have fair skin, applied sunscreen, and live in Texas where the sun can be strong and still got burned in some locations</li>
            <li>It seems to work more or less okay for my husband and daughter, though it comes off pretty easily in the water, which has resulted in some burns.</li>
            <li>am willing to put in more effort for a natural product but this one just won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and suggests on the package, &amp;#34;for more effective sun protection, don&#x27;t rub the product in&amp;#34; or something very similar.</li>
            <li>This worked great, offered extra moisturizing and also makes the bottle last a LOT longer.  </li>
            <li>This one had great ratings and the website actually says it will moisturize at the same time.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not upset about that because it&#x27;s much better to have zinc oxide white than use a chemically laden</li>
            <li>It smells nice, goes on easy, and seems to last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on the skin rather than being absorbed like the sprays and other lotions.</li>
            <li>so easy application is necessary.  </li>
            <li>This was rated very highly by the Environmental Working Group, which rates sunscreens every year.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used this at the beach or in the water, this has worked very well in the instances in which my family and I used it.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>They claim that shipping is free for orders over $40, but that&#x27;s only if you keep the product!  </li>
            <li>The EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database is my primary resource for information regarding products and their ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is reasonable considering how much you go, and how well it spreads.</li>
            <li>and I got a very smug and indifferent response that supposed that I had mis-applied it</li>
            <li>(hadn&#x27;t) or was on a medication that made me very sun-sensitive</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>This makes sense, as a lot of its sun protection is from Zinc, which coats the skin and creates a barrier to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very skin softening</li>
            <li>I was very bummed that it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and I love other Purple Prairie products and thought to try their sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after less than two hours I was bright red.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Chemical blocks don&#x27;t work for me, so I look for high concentrations of zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has tried mineral sunscreens will know they can be difficult to apply so this sounded great.  </li>
            <li>and if it weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d happily use it as a hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pasty white at first, but mostly soaks in</li>
            <li>I make sure to have a towel down as it will transfer white.</li>
            <li>* BUYER BEWARE WARNING if you buy from Purple Prairie directly</li>
            <li>After looking for a natural sunscreen that just contained zinc oxide, I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>On our recent trip to the Islands, both my partner and I got absolutely fried using Sun Stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my young child.  </li>
            <li>I have a 2 year old</li>
            <li>Every year I search for the bests natural sunscreens to get us through summer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because I wanted a safer option for my family; it is 99% natural and EWG/Skin Deep(R) rates it as a 1</li>
            <li>The dermatologists advises you to slop on 2 ounces of sunscreen because the thicker the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SunStuff is natural sun protection with 20% Zinc Oxide and Organic Butters and is a moisturizing mineral lotion.</li>
            <li>They believe in natural, cruelty-free products, recyclable bottles, and for SunStuff, specifically, it meets the rigid standards for sunscreen allowed in the protected coral ref lagoons of Mexico.it</li>
            <li>It smells softly of lavender and goes on like a body butter.</li>
            <li>Me, my wife, and our 1 year old all got scorched at the beach while using this product.  </li>
            <li>After the first day we went to Long&#x27;s and bought Ocean Potion, a regular old cheapo sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I know organic sunscreen is thicker and harder to apply than regular sunscreen, so I was careful to put on a lot and make sure it was spread evenly.</li>
            <li>It would last longer and work better if it is thick.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine directly from the Purple Prairie website and mailed it back for a refund.</li>
            <li>I have a toddler with sensitive skin that his skin did not get irritated nor did he get burned while we played outside for about two hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t any more difficult to apply than any natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Over the past few years I&#x27;ve become a safe product junkie.</li>

            <li> I have yet to receive a sunburn, even during my long runs in the outdoors.</li>
            <li> It does go on thick and takes a little longer to apply than the quick chemical sprays.  </li>
            <li> (I used other commercial, not natural, sun</li>
            <li> have been to Hawaii and several other tropical locations, including those close to the equator</li>
            <li> It leaves less of a white residue than other products, but I have olive skin and it looks like a too white foundation.</li>
            <li> One has to rub this sunscreen on in order to avoid white streaks and the sunscreen does have a slightly tacky feel compared to other &#x27;dry touch&#x27; sunscreens, i.e. one will notice that one is wearing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Yes it still makes you a little white</li>
            <li> When applying, it still leaves a little white tent on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in a lot</li>
            <li> Most of the bad reviews are from people who tried this product about a year ago.</li>
            <li> (wasted forty bucks on two big bottles of Sun Stuff) and</li>
            <li> I have not had a burn in years due to the generous application of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Product was so thick I could barely spread it around.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found it to be super thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> Being that we typically spend 5+ hours at the pool each day, I do reapply during the day.  </li>
            <li> This feels like plain lotion, whereas a lot of other zinc oxide sunscreens leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money too unlike other sunscreens that cost a fortune and come in small bottles.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to rub in, especially on my peach fuzz arms.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this if we&#x27;re going in the water as it doesn&#x27;t quite seem waterpoof but for everyday use, it does the trick.</li>
            <li> We have a pool and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> We of course bought it b/c we wanted to get away from harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t think this is water resistant at all, which could explain how the other reviewer got burned so badly while swimming all day even though he reapplied.    </li>
            <li> It has a a very slight fragrance that one will notice if putting it on the face (sort of coconuty) but not if one is putting it on the body.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li> I am putting it on a small wiggly child</li>
            <li> I spend time at the river in the sun, often all day, and usually go on a vacation a week every year to someplace sunny in Mexico or the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> We applied it so liberally and frequently (at least once per hour) that we looked like ghosts because we were in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> It comes out in a thicker texture but not too thick.</li>
            <li> It is thick but wouldn&#x27;t you want your sunscreen thick?</li>
            <li> and you have to seriously continuously apply any sunscreen all the time in order to keep from getting burned.</li>
            <li> Even worse than this product is the company&#x27;s return policy.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I will never buy anything from this company again</li>
            <li> It takes ages to fully coat yourself in this stuff which immediately made it useless for me.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a painful, peeling sunburn just as bad as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any sunscreen at all.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is good sunscreen.  Not chalky white on the skin. Good coverage.  No overwhelming smell.  You get a lot for your money too unlike other sunscreens that cost a fortune and come in small bottles.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this at the beach or in the water, this has worked very well in the instances in which my family and I used it.  (It probably does work in the water - I just haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try it out.)  It isn&#x27;t any more difficult to apply than any natural sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is good.  I didn&#x27;t find that it made anyone in my family look like a white ghost.  I am pleased with it and will buy another bottle once mine runs out.  :)</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product.  It had great reviews from EWG and is all natural.  Unfortunately, I found it to be super thick and pasty.  It was very hard to rub in, especially on my peach fuzz arms.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t rub in at all on my arms but rather clumped up in my arm hairs!  I ended up scrubbing it off with soap and putting on Badger that day.  When I rinsed it off my face, the water just ran white so I really don&#x27;t think this is water resistant at all, which could explain how the other reviewer got burned so badly while swimming all day even though he reapplied.    I purchased mine directly from the Purple Prairie website and mailed it back for a refund. Even worse than this product is the company&#x27;s return policy.  *** BUYER BEWARE WARNING if you buy from Purple Prairie directly *** They claim that shipping is free for orders over $40, but that&#x27;s only if you keep the product!  If you return it, they deduct the shipping charges from your refund!  They took $10 from me because I didn&#x27;t like their product and returned it.  That is just a rotten way to treat your customers.  It makes me think they must get a lot of returns if they needed to make a policy like that.  Because of this, I won&#x27;t be buying anything else from them because if I don&#x27;t like it and return it, they will punish me for it.</li>
            <li> After looking for a natural sunscreen that just contained zinc oxide, I decided to buy this one. It comes out in a thicker texture but not too thick. One has to rub this sunscreen on in order to avoid white streaks and the sunscreen does have a slightly tacky feel compared to other &#x27;dry touch&#x27; sunscreens, i.e. one will notice that one is wearing sunscreen. Overall, the sunscreen seems to work, and neither myself nor my daughter have gotten burned. It has a a very slight fragrance that one will notice if putting it on the face (sort of coconuty) but not if one is putting it on the body. I don&#x27;t use this if we&#x27;re going in the water as it doesn&#x27;t quite seem waterpoof but for everyday use, it does the trick. The 9 oz. container is a goodsize container, but isn&#x27;t that portable.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years I&#x27;ve become a safe product junkie. The EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database is my primary resource for information regarding products and their ingredients. It is through EWG that I came upon Purple Prairie&#x27;s SunStuff SPF 30. This product is safe (it received a 1 rating from EWG, 0 being best) and works at protecting my very fair skin. I use it daily on my face and chest. I have yet to receive a sunburn, even during my long runs in the outdoors. The product is not greasy and has a mild scent (it smells like what you would expect a sunscreen to smell like). However, I don&#x27;t know how well this product would work for darker complected people. It does leave a ghostly hue on the skin if not rubbed in well, but I found that mixing a few drops of argan oil into the sunscreen works very well at making it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I know organic sunscreen is thicker and harder to apply than regular sunscreen, so I was careful to put on a lot and make sure it was spread evenly. It didn&#x27;t matter, though -- after less than two hours I was bright red.  I ended up with a painful, peeling sunburn just as bad as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> This product was listed on Safemama.com as super safe for kids. I bought it this summer to try it out. We have a pool and use it everyday. My kids have never burned using this product. It even protected the entire family at the lake all day in Texas. I would recommend this product and will be buying it again next summer. I rubs in well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried over a dozen so-called healthy sunscreens, but this one is really good. It smells nice, goes on easy, and seems to last quite a long time. It&#x27;s protected us all summer, no burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable considering how much you go, and how well it spreads. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews about this stuff and was eager to try it on a recent trip to Hawaii. As a bit of background, we regularly travel to tropical locations such as Hawaii, Florida, and Fiji. I have not had a burn in years due to the generous application of sunscreen. On our recent trip to the Islands, both my partner and I got absolutely fried using Sun Stuff. We applied it so liberally and frequently (at least once per hour) that we looked like ghosts because we were in and out of the water. After the first day we went to Long&#x27;s and bought Ocean Potion, a regular old cheapo sunscreen. Worked like a charm. After we got back I e-mailed Purple Prairie about this and I got a very smug and indifferent response that supposed that I had mis-applied it (hadn&#x27;t) or was on a medication that made me very sun-sensitive (wasn&#x27;t). Needless to say I will never buy anything from this company again (wasted forty bucks on two big bottles of Sun Stuff) and I am warning everyone I know about this product. Maybe it works in Minnesota, but it can&#x27;t protect from tropical sun AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my young child.  It does go on thick and takes a little longer to apply than the quick chemical sprays.  But it works and protects their skin. We used it all Memorial Day weekend, and after spending all weekend at the pool, in the sun, we didn&#x27;t have any sunburn. Being that we typically spend 5+ hours at the pool each day, I do reapply during the day.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on the skin rather than being absorbed like the sprays and other lotions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last year after a recommendation from a friend.  It was much too thick and white to apply alone so I ended up mixing it with coconut oil to make it easier to apply.  This worked great, offered extra moisturizing and also makes the bottle last a LOT longer.  Yes it still makes you a little white but I&#x27;m not upset about that because it&#x27;s much better to have zinc oxide white than use a chemically laden now show product or aerosol mist... product that does more harm than good in my opinion.  I have a 2 year old so that is my #1 concern for him and we try to stay out of the sun during the harshest times but when we can&#x27;t help that this product has definitely kept the sunburn away.  Also wanted to mention that have leather seats in our car so if we put it on prior to getting in I make sure to have a towel down as it will transfer white. Again thought this is not a big deal when I don&#x27;t have to worry about my family getting burnt or exposed to chemicals.</li>
            <li> Every year I search for the bests natural sunscreens to get us through summer.  This one had great ratings and the website actually says it will moisturize at the same time.  Anyone who has tried mineral sunscreens will know they can be difficult to apply so this sounded great.  Product was so thick I could barely spread it around.  It takes ages to fully coat yourself in this stuff which immediately made it useless for me.  I am putting it on a small wiggly child so easy application is necessary.  And I didn&#x27;t use it on myself for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to put in more effort for a natural product but this one just won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I spend time at the river in the sun, often all day, and usually go on a vacation a week every year to someplace sunny in Mexico or the Caribbean.  I put this on before I head out the door for the day, and then re-apply once during the day, and I&#x27;ve never burned.  It&#x27;s a little pasty white at first, but mostly soaks in and I appreciate not having to use a sunscreen with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really works well. No sunburn after using it for a week at the shore. Takes a bit to rub in but overall it is great.</li>
            <li> HI, I was pleased with this product purchase, however it does sting when it gets in the eyes.  I was very pleased with how it stayed on and was not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Most of the bad reviews are from people who tried this product about a year ago. I purchased and used this sunscreen in 2012, so maybe the formula is better, because I did not have any problems with my sunscreen. I bought this sunscreen because I wanted a safer option for my family; it is 99% natural and EWG/Skin Deep(R) rates it as a 1 and I love other Purple Prairie products and thought to try their sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been to Hawaii and several other tropical locations, including those close to the equator and you have to seriously continuously apply any sunscreen all the time in order to keep from getting burned. And if your skin is not used to that kind of sun exposure, you will get burned; it is not the sunscreen&#x27;s fault. I am Italian, do not have fair skin, applied sunscreen, and live in Texas where the sun can be strong and still got burned in some locations (I used other commercial, not natural, sun products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen starts off as white as you put it on, but clears up as you wear it. The bottle also advertises this product as \\&quot;non-whitening.\\&quot;  It is thick but wouldn&#x27;t you want your sunscreen thick? It would last longer and work better if it is thick. The dermatologists advises you to slop on 2 ounces of sunscreen because the thicker the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SunStuff is natural sun protection with 20% Zinc Oxide and Organic Butters and is a moisturizing mineral lotion. The directions and ingredients listed in the product description is what is written on the bottle. I have a toddler with sensitive skin that his skin did not get irritated nor did he get burned while we played outside for about two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with the makers of SunStuff, Purple Prairie Botanicals; they have always offered great customer service to me.  I also like this brand because all their products are rated by EWG/Skin Deep(R) 0-2. They believe in natural, cruelty-free products, recyclable bottles, and for SunStuff, specifically, it meets the rigid standards for sunscreen allowed in the protected coral ref lagoons of Mexico.it meets the rigid standards for sunscreen allowed in the protected coral ref lagoons of Mexico.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t actually have an SPF on the package, though on Amazon it&#x27;s listed as SPF 30. It seems to work more or less okay for my husband and daughter, though it comes off pretty easily in the water, which has resulted in some burns. It goes on white and suggests on the package, &amp;#34;for more effective sun protection, don&#x27;t rub the product in&amp;#34; or something very similar. This makes sense, as a lot of its sun protection is from Zinc, which coats the skin and creates a barrier to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very skin softening and if it weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d happily use it as a hand and body lotion. It smells softly of lavender and goes on like a body butter. I wouldn&#x27;t trust my fair skin in the sun with nothing but this product.</li>
            <li> When applying, it still leaves a little white tent on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in a lot and it is a paste style lotion.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best organid zinc oxide sunscreen I have used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  This was rated very highly by the Environmental Working Group, which rates sunscreens every year.  Chemical blocks don&#x27;t work for me, so I look for high concentrations of zinc oxide.  This feels like plain lotion, whereas a lot of other zinc oxide sunscreens leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I like that the product doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals and is almost odorless, but it still leaves too much of a white residue for me. It leaves less of a white residue than other products, but I have olive skin and it looks like a too white foundation.</li>
            <li> Me, my wife, and our 1 year old all got scorched at the beach while using this product.  We of course bought it b/c we wanted to get away from harsh chemicals but it didn&#x27;t work at all.  The company that shipped it \\&quot;Zoom Party\\&quot; was very good about processing our return and refund.  I was very bummed that it didn&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
