            <li> /&gt;Prior to Bepanthol, for my first laser hair removal session, I spent half the night writhing in irritated itchy agony with ice packs on my body furiously coating myself with cortisone cream which did almost nothing.</li>
            <li> My next laser treatment, I iced per usual and applied a small layer of this cream right after.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and the quality as expected.</li>
            <li> Healed facial scarring from a severe case of shingles after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, but smooths well on the face after minor surgery and stitches were removed.  </li>
            <li> I was an itchy uncomfortable regretful disaster for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;Enter my white chariot, Bepanthol.</li>
            <li> that night, i slept soundly, not being awoken by inflamed skin and the angry rash I acquired previously.</li>
            <li> and when I mentioned offhand to a nurse there that I was having a horrible reaction (hives, blisters, redness, itching) to recent laser hair removal, she whips out this tube that looks like diaper rash cream and swears up and down to try it after my next treatment.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It is a little bix expensive, but it works</li>
            <li> I use it three to four times a day, in one month my heels were other!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very thin oily stuff, and runs almost like a lotion.</li>
            <li> it got damage i am so sad about it acutely very bad service i don&#x27;t think will be like this</li>

            <li> The product arrived on time and the quality as expected.</li>
            <li> i use this in the am &amp; pm beneath makeup and my regular moisturizer.  since i started using it my face has cleared up dramatically and any spots heal faster.  don&#x27;t know if its because of this or the Philosophy vitamin C powder but, am pretty much acne free!</li>
            <li> A most have product!! It help a lot to regenerate my cracked heels!!! You have no idea... I use it three to four times a day, in one month my heels were other!!!!!! My sister also use it for her face she suffer acne for several years she&#x27;s now having laser and use Bepanthol and she just looove it and is helping her to heal her face....!!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this cream for everything from burns, scars, and eczema to athletes foot, and its worked like a dream. Healed facial scarring from a severe case of shingles after a few months of use. Always keep a tube handy for emergencies!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, make my skin soft and less dark spots</li>
            <li> Excellent product for daily use.</li>
            <li> great cream and thanks for the fast shipment</li>
            <li> My hope with this ceeam was that it would heal the cracks on the bottom of my feet and it did exactly that!</li>
            <li> I had used one that my sister send to my from Brazil,it&#x27;s completed different,besides I ordered the one that was made in German and received one the was made in Spain.????.Not sure if I will buy again this kind of products on Amazon,they are expensive and don&#x27;t work.The one that I used before,was very useful,on minor cuts,scratches,dry skin,etc.</li>
            <li> It is excellent bepanhenol cream that treats allot of skin problems (cutts, scrapes etc. ) love to use it, it helps heal very quick&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bix expensive, but it works</li>
            <li> Very watery/oily....I thought it would be creamy.I doubt this is even safe to use.</li>
            <li> This is nice as it is good for healing skin, and protective of chaffed or burnt skin. Like a non ichy or desitin. Nice.</li>
            <li> Large tube of clearish white cream.  Not too thick, but smooths well on the face after minor surgery and stitches were removed.  German friend recommend Bepanthol and gave me a sample, but can&#x27;t find the same tube of thicker cream of German origin, but will order again.  Instructions are not in English - read the Amazon explanations thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Very misleading! I am Grman, so when I bought this, I was expecting what I am used go. It is not that at all! Very thin oily stuff, and runs almost like a lotion.</li>
            <li> it got damage i am so sad about it acutely very bad service i don&#x27;t think will be like this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this for myself, but my father seemed to like it. It takes a while to arrive but is a nice cream overall.</li>
            <li> Bepanthen/Bepanthol is a real skin saver for any kind of skin injury/irritation. Always make sure to have it at home, both as a cream and the thicker balm.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for tattoo healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use this for the first three days of healing and it works perfectly for that.</li>
            <li> MOST AMAZING PRODUCT EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I am OBSESSED.&lt;br /&gt;I go to all those med spas and beauty clinics for peels, treatments, etc. and when I mentioned offhand to a nurse there that I was having a horrible reaction (hives, blisters, redness, itching) to recent laser hair removal, she whips out this tube that looks like diaper rash cream and swears up and down to try it after my next treatment. Tells me her coworker was in Greece and picked up a tube and all their patients love it for laser facials, hair removal, minor procedures, burns, etc. etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Bepanthol, for my first laser hair removal session, I spent half the night writhing in irritated itchy agony with ice packs on my body furiously coating myself with cortisone cream which did almost nothing. I tried advil, benadryl, nothing made a big difference. I was an itchy uncomfortable regretful disaster for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;Enter my white chariot, Bepanthol. My next laser treatment, I iced per usual and applied a small layer of this cream right after. HOLY schnikees! It felt cool going on, not itchy, not heavy. It soaked in right away. that night, i slept soundly, not being awoken by inflamed skin and the angry rash I acquired previously. my skin healed post-laser within DAYS. I applied several times a day post laser and after 4-5 days the itchiness was completely gone and my skin was losing its redness rapidly. i SWEAR by this stuff. i wish they sold it here. it&#x27;s a lifesaver! highly recommend for everyone, great for burns, injuries, anything where your skin is injured or burned or irritated. truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Only one thing I did not like. This time the cream came different, came too watery.</li>
            <li> Very good product ! Fast shipping.</li>
