            <li>I have been doing my own nails for quite some time, I have used practically.</li>
            <li>that is why I decided to purchase this kit and do my own nails</li>
            <li>I am gonna save a lot of money doing my own acrylic nails</li>
            <li>Nice starter kit for a beginner to use at home.</li>
            <li>is nice too.  </li>
            <li>Nice kit to get started with doing your own acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I did not use the nails tips, I just applied the acrylic powder to my own nails to help them be a bit stronger and easier to polish, One application lasted two weeks.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice and arrived just as it should have and was well worth the price I paid and would order again!</li>
            <li>the product smell very strongly</li>
            <li>The directions help and glad it comes with a nice primer.</li>
            <li>the foam has only one kind of lime to, too strong to me, but I had another one, with I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The other product in the kit are perfect, you&#x27;ll need to practice to make a perfect job but it a good basis.</li>
            <li>I love that is it made in the USA and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>Just wished that it came with more nail tips</li>
            <li>but I just bought different powder, the rest was awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful kit if you&#x27;re just starting out with acrylics!</li>
            <li>Also love the glue.  </li>
            <li>Love the file and the top coat polish</li>
            <li>Everything is perfect the only thing is that the liquid runs out so you may need to buy another.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, im sure</li>
            <li>but I can just order more of that stuff separately.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love this product</li>
            <li>anyway most of the time!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>And no complaints i love it in fact.</li>
            <li>OMG; a skunk smells better than this monomer.</li>
            <li>i couldt even do one set of nails because i needed more nails to fit mine</li>
            <li>kit is perfect for someone who wants to do their own nails and they not sure if its a good idea, ull know after u use it if u want to continue or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came fast and good wrapped.</li>
            <li>easy to work with...not a lot of filing....</li>
            <li>Came with everything I needed and since I have a nail drill, it was easy to shape the acrylic.</li>
            <li>Works well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Comes with almost everything you need, although the monomer liquid did run out very quickly.</li>
            <li>it was easy to apply and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Will purchase full size when kit runs out :-)</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best kit I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I will be saving a bunch of money doing my own nails, I did not need the tips but even without I didn&#x27;t do it correctly the first time because I was following the instruction</li>
            <li>wants to do their own acrylics.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy Mia secrets I will continue to order them.</li>
            <li>that it is mma free.</li>
            <li>The nails were cheap and I received 2 primers and no monomer.</li>
            <li>then I just used the monomer on my nail and dip it into the powder 2 - 3 times and then use the emery block, the second time was better and I am sure that I will get better and better at it.</li>
            <li>but overall im happy</li>
            <li>I like the acrylic formula with the monomer and really enjoy using it with the brush that was provided in the kit.</li>
            <li>I love this kit and would highly recommend it I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Got me excited to know I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot at the salons.</li>
            <li>It tells you to clean the brush(that</li>
            <li>it is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how to clean the brush, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good investment if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li>the nail file has only one kind of lime, a strong one, no trace of a softer one&lt;</li>
            <li>the only thing that could be better would be a better brush for application.</li>
            <li>I went through the monomer quickly, but,</li>
            <li>Delivers quick...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they would&#x27;ve been much better if the proper tools that I paid for were supplied</li>
            <li>quick note on the Monomer</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the rest of the kit and had long lasting results of beautiful nails</li>
            <li>I used this kit the very first day that I received it</li>
            <li>It took me about an hour getting them smooth and ready to polish.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s priced right (at the time of your purchase...)</li>
            <li>you have never done your own acrylics and want to learn, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this kit but realize you won&#x27;t be perfect in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Using only the products supplied in the kit (except nail polish remover), I did my own nails for the first time in about 8 years.</li>
            <li>The amount of money you will be saving in the long run by doing your own versus going to a salon will be staggering.</li>
            <li>The monomer is strong as far as smell.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>but it really isint worth jt</li>
            <li>This is the first time I do my nails, I have always done my nails at the salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the brand Mia Secret!  </li>
            <li>but, I really like the brush it came with!  </li>
            <li>First time doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li>and this was my first time ever doing acrylic, however theres not a lot of acrylic liquid</li>
            <li>This is my first experience doing it, and holy hell.</li>
            <li>should have known better to do it before I got extra tips (some on the way</li>
            <li>I found this product to be better then my cheapest ones as a bigener i am growing to a second step</li>
            <li>so be aware of keep it in a closet</li>
            <li>The only thing was I used all the monomer on first use so have to get more.</li>
            <li>the brush was ruined after the first time i used it</li>
            <li>Other than that it comes with everything you need to do your own acrylic nails...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m impatient!), but I&#x27;m glad that now I know the acrylic and other provided items are very nice; tips aside, which I would just say to toss all together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They had pretty fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>it really suck they shipped fast</li>
            <li>I get very upset when I read product reviews stating the quality of the product is sub-standard</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfactory product.</li>
            <li>Giving 1 star because of fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The tips I didn&#x27;t care for so much,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this Mia Secret Acrylic  Nail Kit.</li>
            <li>Very practice and confortable</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so just keep the bottles standing straight up.</li>
            <li>I used the whole soaking them for 30 minutes in Acetone while wrapped in foil, and let me just say.</li>
            <li>It Came Really Fast</li>
            <li>I think it holds better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>The instructions helped but left out how to clean the brush after use.</li>
            <li>I soaked it in nail polish remover to clean it for the next use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are concise and if you follow them to the letter, you will quickly be doing professional quality nails, but be patient.</li>
            <li>i am definitely going to repurchase the full size bottles....</li>
            <li>or so you get used to it again, so be sure to do this outside or next to a window or even in a bathroom that has an exhaust fan</li>
            <li>The powder is consistent and does not dry too fast.</li>
            <li>Almost a week later, still bonded nice and tight with no air bubbles or lifting.</li>
            <li>The kit is very complete, some remark however :&lt;</li>
            <li>but then there is an admission they have only done their nails for the first time.</li>
            <li>Even with this small issue, the kit is still top notch</li>
            <li>(except for tips) I&#x27;m very pleased with the Mia Secret kit.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little strong, but ventilation will help with the smell.</li>
            <li>I have since ordered an electric nail file, and other fun stuff to do my nails, and there&#x27;s still enough product left in the kit to do my nails again at least 10 more times!!</li>
            <li>I was a little upset that it didn&#x27;t come with a nail dehydrator, but I was able to pick one up at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick, with everything BUT two other acrylic powders.</li>
            <li>Got it a day early</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind, just put a little fan next to me or have the windows open if possible and its better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only real issue I have found is the size of the brush - mine was quite big, almost the size of the standard oil based paint brush.  </li>
            <li>In the end i dont regret it because i messed up a little on my right hand</li>
            <li>and the only reason i took off the nails and put new ones on is because i wanted a different style of nail....</li>
            <li>Mine came with only clear, which is no big deal since I keep my nails painted</li>
            <li>(One answer claims it came with three acrylic powders, a Pink, Clear, and white?</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It tells you to clean the brush(that</li>
            <li> it is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how to clean the brush, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good investment if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li> the nail file has only one kind of lime, a strong one, no trace of a softer one&lt;</li>
            <li> the only thing that could be better would be a better brush for application.</li>
            <li> I went through the monomer quickly, but,</li>
            <li> Delivers quick...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they would&#x27;ve been much better if the proper tools that I paid for were supplied</li>
            <li> quick note on the Monomer</li>
            <li> Shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the rest of the kit and had long lasting results of beautiful nails</li>
            <li> I used this kit the very first day that I received it</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour getting them smooth and ready to polish.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s priced right (at the time of your purchase...)</li>
            <li> you have never done your own acrylics and want to learn, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this kit but realize you won&#x27;t be perfect in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Using only the products supplied in the kit (except nail polish remover), I did my own nails for the first time in about 8 years.</li>
            <li> The amount of money you will be saving in the long run by doing your own versus going to a salon will be staggering.</li>
            <li> The monomer is strong as far as smell.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> but it really isint worth jt</li>
            <li> This is the first time I do my nails, I have always done my nails at the salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the brand Mia Secret!  </li>
            <li> but, I really like the brush it came with!  </li>
            <li> First time doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li> and this was my first time ever doing acrylic, however theres not a lot of acrylic liquid</li>
            <li> This is my first experience doing it, and holy hell.</li>
            <li> should have known better to do it before I got extra tips (some on the way</li>
            <li> I found this product to be better then my cheapest ones as a bigener i am growing to a second step</li>
            <li> so be aware of keep it in a closet</li>
            <li> The only thing was I used all the monomer on first use so have to get more.</li>
            <li> the brush was ruined after the first time i used it</li>
            <li> Other than that it comes with everything you need to do your own acrylic nails...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m impatient!), but I&#x27;m glad that now I know the acrylic and other provided items are very nice; tips aside, which I would just say to toss all together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They had pretty fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> it really suck they shipped fast</li>
            <li> I get very upset when I read product reviews stating the quality of the product is sub-standard</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfactory product.</li>
            <li> Giving 1 star because of fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The tips I didn&#x27;t care for so much,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this Mia Secret Acrylic  Nail Kit.</li>
            <li> Very practice and confortable</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so just keep the bottles standing straight up.</li>
            <li> I used the whole soaking them for 30 minutes in Acetone while wrapped in foil, and let me just say.</li>
            <li> It Came Really Fast</li>
            <li> I think it holds better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> The instructions helped but left out how to clean the brush after use.</li>
            <li> I soaked it in nail polish remover to clean it for the next use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are concise and if you follow them to the letter, you will quickly be doing professional quality nails, but be patient.</li>
            <li> i am definitely going to repurchase the full size bottles....</li>
            <li> or so you get used to it again, so be sure to do this outside or next to a window or even in a bathroom that has an exhaust fan</li>
            <li> The powder is consistent and does not dry too fast.</li>
            <li> Almost a week later, still bonded nice and tight with no air bubbles or lifting.</li>
            <li> The kit is very complete, some remark however :&lt;</li>
            <li> but then there is an admission they have only done their nails for the first time.</li>
            <li> Even with this small issue, the kit is still top notch</li>
            <li> (except for tips) I&#x27;m very pleased with the Mia Secret kit.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little strong, but ventilation will help with the smell.</li>
            <li> I have since ordered an electric nail file, and other fun stuff to do my nails, and there&#x27;s still enough product left in the kit to do my nails again at least 10 more times!!</li>
            <li> I was a little upset that it didn&#x27;t come with a nail dehydrator, but I was able to pick one up at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick, with everything BUT two other acrylic powders.</li>
            <li> Got it a day early</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind, just put a little fan next to me or have the windows open if possible and its better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only real issue I have found is the size of the brush - mine was quite big, almost the size of the standard oil based paint brush.  </li>
            <li> In the end i dont regret it because i messed up a little on my right hand</li>
            <li> and the only reason i took off the nails and put new ones on is because i wanted a different style of nail....</li>
            <li> Mine came with only clear, which is no big deal since I keep my nails painted</li>
            <li> (One answer claims it came with three acrylic powders, a Pink, Clear, and white?</li>
            <li> so i was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know HOW it broke because I was careful not to run into anything with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I use it for rhinestones and other nail art</li>
            <li> Once I Use The Product Other Than that</li>
            <li> The other negative is that the monomer bottle was open and spilled all over the kit.</li>
            <li> Less then a week.</li>
            <li> I must caution against laying the bottles down as mine leaked out even with the lid on tight...</li>
            <li> and for 16 dollars you just waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because my kit was missing the brush and in the directions</li>
            <li> I figured I could use it outdoors if the smell was too intense, but this is even too bad an odor for outdoors.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small package of nail tips</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smell ANY worse than your average nail salon.</li>
            <li> even the primer..which is hard to find in a kit like this.</li>
            <li> The powder is too thick</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, UNLESS one of your nails snaps off and you don&#x27;t have any extras so you have to forfeit the entire operation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product actually is no good</li>
            <li> (Read below!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deducted because the provided tips are pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> I purchased an 8oz bottle from Mia Secret.</li>
            <li> and i chosen mia secret kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied to say the least!!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wasn&#x27;t real crazy about the tips they give you.</li>
            <li> i am sad that i ran out of the monomer...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> but it is getting very expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product actually is no good i couldt even do one set of nails because i needed more nails to fit mine it really suck they shipped fast but it really isint worth jt and for 16 dollars you just waste your money dont order this its junk just go to sallys you can get the big kit for 25 20 dollars whit actually every thing</li>
            <li> this product is awesome.  I am a problem lifter and this product did not lift at all....my acrylic nails lasted 3 weeks. and the only reason i took off the nails and put new ones on is because i wanted a different style of nail....this is a great sampler kit.  i am sad that i ran out of the monomer...i am definitely going to repurchase the full size bottles....great product.  easy to work with...not a lot of filing....the best product i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best kit I have ever used. I have been doing my own nails for quite some time, I have used practically. the gambit in nail products and I have finally found the kit I intend to stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never done your own acrylics and want to learn, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this kit but realize you won&#x27;t be perfect in the beginning. The instructions are concise and if you follow them to the letter, you will quickly be doing professional quality nails, but be patient. I get very upset when I read product reviews stating the quality of the product is sub-standard but then there is an admission they have only done their nails for the first time. I have been doing mine for over a year and there are still times I do not get the liquid to powder ratio right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue I have found is the size of the brush - mine was quite big, almost the size of the standard oil based paint brush.  It would be in your best interest to get yourself a good quality brush for maximum success.  Even with this small issue, the kit is still top notch and I will be suggesting this to everyone I run into that wants to do their own acrylics.  The amount of money you will be saving in the long run by doing your own versus going to a salon will be staggering.</li>
            <li> Great product! Came on time and the best part is the acrylic holds. Yes I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I enjoy Mia secrets I will continue to order them. I love that is it made in the USA and that it is mma free. I&#x27;m glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just wished that it came with more nail tips</li>
            <li> I love this kit! This is the first time I do my nails, I have always done my nails at the salon but it is getting very expensive that is why I decided to purchase this kit and do my own nails, I also bought the dual nail system. To be the first time I am very proud of my work and very happy with this kit!!!! I am gonna save a lot of money doing my own acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Like the product. Works great.</li>
            <li> The powder is too thick but I just bought different powder, the rest was awesome</li>
            <li> Great started kit!! Has everything you need to do a great set of acrylics the only thing that could be better would be a better brush for application. the bristles started coming out and into the acritics the the actual Handel broke from the metal piece. That being an easI&#x27;ll replaced part I enjoyed the rest of the kit and had long lasting results of beautiful nails</li>
            <li> I used this kit the very first day that I received it and I like it very much. Came with everything I needed and since I have a nail drill, it was easy to shape the acrylic. But the files that come with the kit also work well to shape the acrylic.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfactory product. The glue didn&#x27;t work.. The nails were cheap and I received 2 primers and no monomer. Therefore I had to go to the nearest beauty supply store to buy some. Giving 1 star because of fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and arrived just as it should have and was well worth the price I paid and would order again!</li>
            <li> Nice starter kit for a beginner to use at home. Got me excited to know I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot at the salons. Works well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good value.  Will buy their products again.</li>
            <li> Comes with almost everything you need, although the monomer liquid did run out very quickly. I was a little upset that it didn&#x27;t come with a nail dehydrator, but I was able to pick one up at my local beauty supply store. It&#x27;s a wonderful kit if you&#x27;re just starting out with acrylics!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the brand Mia Secret!  I think I&#x27;ll always purchase from them!  The tips I didn&#x27;t care for so much, but, I really like the brush it came with!  I went through the monomer quickly, but, I purchased an 8oz bottle from Mia Secret. I also purchased the nail dehydrator that&#x27;s recommended. But, this kit does come with primer which is great!  Also love the glue.  I think it holds better than other brands.  I use it for rhinestones and other nail art and they don&#x27;t come off till you take them off.  Love the file and the top coat polish is nice too.  It&#x27;s a good investment if you&#x27;re just starting out.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a number of brands, and this one exceeds them all. There is no yellowing, lifting, or difficulty in application. The powder is consistent and does not dry too fast. Will purchase full size when kit runs out :-)</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect the only thing is that the liquid runs out so you may need to buy another. Will be ordering again! :) great for beginners .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this Mia Secret Acrylic  Nail Kit. It arrived in about a week. Using only the products supplied in the kit (except nail polish remover), I did my own nails for the first time in about 8 years. It took me about an hour getting them smooth and ready to polish. After 2 weeks, and two polish changes, there has been no lifting or breaking. I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments. I have since ordered an electric nail file, and other fun stuff to do my nails, and there&#x27;s still enough product left in the kit to do my nails again at least 10 more times!! (except for tips) I&#x27;m very pleased with the Mia Secret kit.</li>
            <li> Very practice and confortable</li>
            <li> Delivers quick...&lt;br /&gt;Great start kit, does not come with dehydrator, but i already had it. First time doing my nails at home. I was so exicted that i forgot to put primer on lol. Even though i forgot to, it didnt lift till the 5th day, im sure if i would of used it, would of lasted two weeks on. In the end i dont regret it because i messed up a little on my right hand, now i get a chance to redo them.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is perfect for someone who wants to do their own nails and they not sure if its a good idea, ull know after u use it if u want to continue or not.&lt;br /&gt;Things u will need that didnt come included&lt;br /&gt;Dehydrator, nail tip cutter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wasn&#x27;t real crazy about the tips they give you. Other than that it comes with everything you need to do your own acrylic nails...even the primer..which is hard to find in a kit like this. They had pretty fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit If it&#x27;s priced right (at the time of your purchase...)</li>
            <li> Best quality ever they worth every penny</li>
            <li> Nice kit to get started with doing your own acrylic nails. The directions help and glad it comes with a nice primer. The monomer is strong as far as smell. But I don&#x27;t mind, just put a little fan next to me or have the windows open if possible and its better. I like the files. They get all the ridges and stuff off my nails. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a most wonderful kit. The smell was a little strong, but ventilation will help with the smell. The product was exceptional it was easy to apply and easy to use. I did not use the nails tips, I just applied the acrylic powder to my own nails to help them be a bit stronger and easier to polish, One application lasted two weeks. A great product. I will keep using this and telling my friends about it. The instructions helped but left out how to clean the brush after use. I soaked it in nail polish remover to clean it for the next use.</li>
            <li> I like this kit a lot. My nails turned out really great and this was my first time ever doing acrylic, however theres not a lot of acrylic liquid and it&#x27;s a small package of nail tips but I can just order more of that stuff separately. Otherwise I love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because my kit was missing the brush and in the directions It tells you to clean the brush(that I didn&#x27;t have) between each nail with something that isn&#x27;t included.. They didn&#x27;t turn out the greatest but I&#x27;m sure they would&#x27;ve been much better if the proper tools that I paid for were supplied</li>
            <li> Great acrylic kit. I used it with nail forms and had great luck.  Almost a week later, still bonded nice and tight with no air bubbles or lifting.</li>
            <li> Perfect acrylic nail set!!! It worked wonderfully on my nails that I do myself.. I must caution against laying the bottles down as mine leaked out even with the lid on tight... so just keep the bottles standing straight up.</li>
            <li> Got it a day early and I&#x27;m happy with the product but there&#x27;s a big problem! I ordered 2 and only got 1!!!! I&#x27;ve email but I still have yet the get a reply .. I&#x27;m not satisfied to say the least!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quick, with everything BUT two other acrylic powders. (One answer claims it came with three acrylic powders, a Pink, Clear, and white? Mine came with only clear, which is no big deal since I keep my nails painted anyway most of the time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic is SOLID. This is my first experience doing it, and holy hell. (Read below!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deducted because the provided tips are pretty terrible. I did four fingers (two on each hand) as a practice, and when I was doing the opposite, one of the tips SNAPPED, which resulted in my having to take them all off. I don&#x27;t even know HOW it broke because I was careful not to run into anything with my fingers. I used the whole soaking them for 30 minutes in Acetone while wrapped in foil, and let me just say. Maybe it was something correct I did or something but the acrylic would NOT come off. Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, UNLESS one of your nails snaps off and you don&#x27;t have any extras so you have to forfeit the entire operation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better to do it before I got extra tips (some on the way but I&#x27;m impatient!), but I&#x27;m glad that now I know the acrylic and other provided items are very nice; tips aside, which I would just say to toss all together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note on the Monomer, it doesn&#x27;t smell ANY worse than your average nail salon. After about 20 minutes you won&#x27;t smell it anymore. EVERYONE ELSE will smell it, and it will smell like a nail salon, but after 20 minutes or so you get used to it again, so be sure to do this outside or next to a window or even in a bathroom that has an exhaust fan (as to if it would work I have yet to test, but I&#x27;m assuming it would!).</li>
            <li> Great product arrived fast. Included everything listed</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I will be saving a bunch of money doing my own nails, I did not need the tips but even without I didn&#x27;t do it correctly the first time because I was following the instruction then I just used the monomer on my nail and dip it into the powder 2 - 3 times and then use the emery block, the second time was better and I am sure that I will get better and better at it.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with all you need to do my nails</li>
            <li> I found this product to be better then my cheapest ones as a bigener i am growing to a second step and i chosen mia secret kit. And no complaints i love it in fact. So i can move up to a bigger size. It came fast and good wrapped. I will keep purchasing this again. I fell for a rookie that i am this hole kit supplies works justice for me. Awsom.</li>
            <li> The kit is very complete, some remark however :&lt;br /&gt;- the product smell very strongly so be aware of keep it in a closet&lt;br /&gt;- the nail file has only one kind of lime, a strong one, no trace of a softer one&lt;br /&gt;- the foam has only one kind of lime to, too strong to me, but I had another one, with I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The other product in the kit are perfect, you&#x27;ll need to practice to make a perfect job but it a good basis.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how to clean the brush, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I love this kit and would highly recommend it I love everything about it. It comes with everything you need. The only thing was I used all the monomer on first use so have to get more.</li>
            <li> My kit didn&#x27;t come with the tips that was promised I want a refund</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Shipping was super quick. Took 2-3 days. Less then a week. Great product. Very happy &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> great starter kit to do your own nails. the brush was ruined after the first time i used it so i was kind of disappointed. but overall im happy</li>
            <li> It Came Really Fast Only Took 3 Days To Get Here Very Pleased With What I Got Only I Will Do An Update Once I Use The Product Other Than that I Was Very Happy With What I Got Would Recommend Buying From This Seller !. (:</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to test out different brands of acrylic. I thought it was inexpensive and a great buy. I like the acrylic formula with the monomer and really enjoy using it with the brush that was provided in the kit. Only downside is that you should not only use the primer that is included but also bond aid which isn&#x27;t included in the kit. But, buying bond aid seperatly is inexpensive anyway.</li>
            <li> I ignored the comments about the smell, because I wanted a product that was made here in the USA. OMG; a skunk smells better than this monomer. I figured I could use it outdoors if the smell was too intense, but this is even too bad an odor for outdoors. The other negative is that the monomer bottle was open and spilled all over the kit. Now, my entire house smells of chemicals. UGH!</li>
