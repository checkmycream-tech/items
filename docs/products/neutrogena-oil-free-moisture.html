            <li>This is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li>this works awesomely!!</li>
            <li>and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Perfect lotion with sunblock</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>So happy!</li>
            <li>Very good products.  </li>
            <li>My wife thinks it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all which is great, and afterwards I just pat on my powder</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with sun screen.</li>
            <li>I think they both work great, but the Aveeno leaves a stinkier sulfur sunscreen smell on your skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is great for any time of the day, but she prefers applying it after washing her face at night.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer with a great name.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a moisturizer, invisible, protects from the sun, fragrance-free, has convenient packaging.</li>
            <li>Very good package and nice to use it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>The SPF is good for me&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li>Good value (size, SPF, etc)</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge plus that it&#x27;s SPF 35 because I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and feels good on my skin, but after an hour or two my face looks greasier than I have ever seen it look in my life.  </li>
            <li>wish it smelled nice but works good</li>
            <li>My favorite go-to!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This a really nice Spf moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels more like sunscreen than I hoped it would, but it does spread very easily and I can put it fairly close to my eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion from Neutrogena its light weight, smells great (not overpowering), and I know that it won&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I have never had a product hurt this much (OK maybe the super cheap foundation I bought once when I was a teenager LOL!)  </li>
            <li>So easy to put on this moisturizer every day, and have your sun protection too!</li>
            <li>Love the non-greasy feel of the 35 spf moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for years now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best moisturizer/sunscreen combination I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Mine was more of a bronze and silver tube and it was \\&quot;Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that I like the product that isn&#x27;t being shown.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s SPF 35.</li>
            <li>There is a daytime lotion with 15 spf that feels and smells better</li>
            <li>I thought this was a moisturizer, but it feels and smells more like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is OK but the top that attaches to a spring came off as soon as I go it.  </li>
            <li>Nice light feel, not oily or slimy and a nice light fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>For day to day use is ok, but no tratment</li>
            <li>works much better.</li>
            <li>Simply it does its job, best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>she also likes the smell, pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite sunscreen, but it works.</li>
            <li>i talked with a nice woman who was much older and had nice skin.  </li>
            <li>Consistently great product for those with sensitive skin who also want an oil free product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and somewhat sensitive, and this lotion feels just right to me.</li>
            <li>But with the high SPF it is good to use when doing yard work or exercise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, smells good, isn&#x27;t overly greasy and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years now and is perfect for my normal skin plus the SPF 35 makes it complete.</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  not alcohal free</li>
            <li>Besides not preventing peeling, this cream is a great buy for people just looking for a simple moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li>and although aging out of &#x27;oily Italian&#x27; skin, it feels great when applied.</li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35 for years but had run out.</li>
            <li>the liquid is the consistency of hand lotion and rubs in so smoothly even on my manly arms.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed at a better price than its name brand rivals.  </li>
            <li>This product is oil free, but it feels super greasy.</li>
            <li>but it is not so great if you are in the inbetween stage of being oily and dry.  </li>
            <li>it is very light, and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>i hope it&#x27;s worth it; but she was pretty supportive of it</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, but you can definitely feel like you</li>
            <li>I use one pump for my whole face, and I love that it has the built in sunscreen</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated most of the day and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved on to use the oil free moisture for sensitive skin and that works wonders for me :)</li>
            <li>Excellent for daily use, especially on oily skin.</li>
            <li>The SPF is just right for my blond hair , blue eyes, and fair skin protecting me everywhere I apply it.</li>
            <li>So, yeah, this stuff is pretty smooth and lotiony</li>
            <li>and it absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>All in all great little thing to have.</li>
            <li>I really like this, it gives my skin a smooth matte finish</li>
            <li>I am happy with the everyday use.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer actually makes my skin feel soft and is great under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Then after about 2-3 hours, my skin becomes even more oily that I am naturally (to make up for the lack of moisture my skin</li>
            <li>I think I will purchase the non-SPF versions in the future and apply my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very sleek and clean, and the cap is a twistable that makes you twist it before getting cream, which prevents cream leaks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li>So easy to get exactly the amount you need with just a slight pump of the top button...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this when the bottle I have runs out.</li>
            <li>so im pretty</li>
            <li>I have given my Asian skin many freckles from being irresponsible and not wearing any sunscreen for years, even while baking at the beach.</li>
            <li>It leaves an oily residue for several minutes, (30 at the most,) but that doesn&#x27;t bother her a lot.</li>
            <li>than helped me, this is my second day using it, and love it.</li>
            <li>It must use alcohol in order to be oil free, but if you have sensitive skin, it will burn about 10 minutes after you apply.</li>
            <li>Stings a bit for the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Good cream, especially for such price!</li>
            <li>I usually think of Neutrogena as a good brand.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and this one is very light and dissipates almost immediately which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I also have a sensitive nose and very much appreciate the fact it has no fragrance!</li>
            <li>This seems to work for me, but if you have very dry skin, opt for something more emollient.</li>
            <li>This is the reason why I don&#x27;t really have any loyalty for any particular brands, thus I always just buy the first fragrance-free moisturizer I find in the drug store.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so it can be a chore trying to keep the dryer parts moisturized and the oily parts from getting worse, but my skin looks and feels great at the end of the day when I use this.</li>
            <li>works very well agaisnt the suns rays</li>
            <li>I did not break out from this product, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it as much as others in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel very greasy and absorbs well in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it is an SPF over 30</li>
            <li>The smell fades fast</li>
            <li>This product goes on skin very well.lo</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, simple moisturizer-perfect for daily dryness.</li>
            <li>Due to my fair skin, my dermatologist recommended that I wear a daily moisturizer with SPF in order to protect my face.</li>
            <li>Funny enough, my skin does not like this particular moisturizer (the one for sensitive skin is fine).</li>
            <li>This product is light weight and smells normal, like a lighter version of standard Neutrogena sunblock.</li>
            <li>Our family has used this product daily for protection from the sun for almost twenty years because it works, is not expensive, and it is quickly absorbed without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Small size does tuck nicely into my purse and stays there.</li>
            <li>In the meantime my old standby Neutrogena arrived and will remain my first choice.</li>
            <li>I found that this price on Amazon is way better than what I can get at a typical drug store.</li>
            <li>so it goes quickly,  How about a larger bottle?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and does a decent job protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and always wear sunblock when exercising outside or at the beach, but I always neglected everyday spf.</li>
            <li>Smells strongly of sunscreen, which is minus one star.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be getting the other again; this is far better.    </li>
            <li>I ordered this spf lotion because I&#x27;m outside walking to the train on most days and my skin needs protection and gets a bit dry.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, it will feel all right when you put it on, but if you put anything over it, like a tinted moisturizer or foundation, all of a sudden the combination starts to burn.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>As the summer started I needed a new one</li>
            <li>I love this on my skin, feels really soft after use, but after a few hours my skin feels oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just very surprised they had a reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li>I picked it up at Target for ten dollars; one of the cheaper skin products for higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with it burning or itching!</li>
            <li>Actually it smells exactly like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Even other brands that say they are non-comedogenic lead to breakouts for me (maybe it&#x27;s an allergic reaction to the ingredients), but this one has been tried and true.</li>
            <li>I always still had dry flaky skin right after using this product.</li>
            <li>works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dirty or clog your pores&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face looks clear and radiant.</li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what this would feel like on a person with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>My face is too sensitive for tradional sunscreen, so I use this instead.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.</li>
            <li>so i am always looking to find products that are sensitive towards my skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, but I generally have normal skin that doesn&#x27;t break out too often</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a reasonably priced moisturizer with SPF 30, but now the only time I use it is when I am doing something active outside and don&#x27;t care what I look like.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product last night for the first and last time.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying something different.  </li>
            <li>but it was easy to find here on Amazon but not available in my local stores for some reason.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using moisturizer for many years because without it my face would just dry up and peal off in a few hours.</li>
            <li>(a minor con)&lt;br /&gt;-not really moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than the other Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizers of similar prices.</li>
            <li>I believe this product caused some new comedones on my face, which is why I knocked off the second star.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel my skin dry, and I don&#x27;t need as much powder as before.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>she highly recommended it, she said there is literally no difference from the much more expensive brands she&#x27;d tried.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels quite soft, actually!</li>
            <li>Soaks in similarly to the regular Sensitive Skin version.</li>
            <li>The SPF of the moisturizer makes the texture a little more gritty and heavy.</li>
            <li>It needs to be reapplied as sweat breaks it down as well as just the absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this one because it is less greasy and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny when I get to work.  </li>

            <li> Then after about 2-3 hours, my skin becomes even more oily that I am naturally (to make up for the lack of moisture my skin</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase the non-SPF versions in the future and apply my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very sleek and clean, and the cap is a twistable that makes you twist it before getting cream, which prevents cream leaks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li> So easy to get exactly the amount you need with just a slight pump of the top button...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this when the bottle I have runs out.</li>
            <li> so im pretty</li>
            <li> I have given my Asian skin many freckles from being irresponsible and not wearing any sunscreen for years, even while baking at the beach.</li>
            <li> It leaves an oily residue for several minutes, (30 at the most,) but that doesn&#x27;t bother her a lot.</li>
            <li> than helped me, this is my second day using it, and love it.</li>
            <li> It must use alcohol in order to be oil free, but if you have sensitive skin, it will burn about 10 minutes after you apply.</li>
            <li> Stings a bit for the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Good cream, especially for such price!</li>
            <li> I usually think of Neutrogena as a good brand.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and this one is very light and dissipates almost immediately which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I also have a sensitive nose and very much appreciate the fact it has no fragrance!</li>
            <li> This seems to work for me, but if you have very dry skin, opt for something more emollient.</li>
            <li> This is the reason why I don&#x27;t really have any loyalty for any particular brands, thus I always just buy the first fragrance-free moisturizer I find in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so it can be a chore trying to keep the dryer parts moisturized and the oily parts from getting worse, but my skin looks and feels great at the end of the day when I use this.</li>
            <li> works very well agaisnt the suns rays</li>
            <li> I did not break out from this product, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it as much as others in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel very greasy and absorbs well in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it is an SPF over 30</li>
            <li> The smell fades fast</li>
            <li> This product goes on skin very well.lo</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, simple moisturizer-perfect for daily dryness.</li>
            <li> Due to my fair skin, my dermatologist recommended that I wear a daily moisturizer with SPF in order to protect my face.</li>
            <li> Funny enough, my skin does not like this particular moisturizer (the one for sensitive skin is fine).</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and smells normal, like a lighter version of standard Neutrogena sunblock.</li>
            <li> Our family has used this product daily for protection from the sun for almost twenty years because it works, is not expensive, and it is quickly absorbed without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Small size does tuck nicely into my purse and stays there.</li>
            <li> In the meantime my old standby Neutrogena arrived and will remain my first choice.</li>
            <li> I found that this price on Amazon is way better than what I can get at a typical drug store.</li>
            <li> so it goes quickly,  How about a larger bottle?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and does a decent job protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and always wear sunblock when exercising outside or at the beach, but I always neglected everyday spf.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly of sunscreen, which is minus one star.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be getting the other again; this is far better.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this spf lotion because I&#x27;m outside walking to the train on most days and my skin needs protection and gets a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it will feel all right when you put it on, but if you put anything over it, like a tinted moisturizer or foundation, all of a sudden the combination starts to burn.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> As the summer started I needed a new one</li>
            <li> I love this on my skin, feels really soft after use, but after a few hours my skin feels oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very surprised they had a reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> I picked it up at Target for ten dollars; one of the cheaper skin products for higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with it burning or itching!</li>
            <li> Actually it smells exactly like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Even other brands that say they are non-comedogenic lead to breakouts for me (maybe it&#x27;s an allergic reaction to the ingredients), but this one has been tried and true.</li>
            <li> I always still had dry flaky skin right after using this product.</li>
            <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dirty or clog your pores&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face looks clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what this would feel like on a person with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> My face is too sensitive for tradional sunscreen, so I use this instead.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.</li>
            <li> so i am always looking to find products that are sensitive towards my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, but I generally have normal skin that doesn&#x27;t break out too often</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a reasonably priced moisturizer with SPF 30, but now the only time I use it is when I am doing something active outside and don&#x27;t care what I look like.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product last night for the first and last time.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying something different.  </li>
            <li> but it was easy to find here on Amazon but not available in my local stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using moisturizer for many years because without it my face would just dry up and peal off in a few hours.</li>
            <li> (a minor con)&lt;br /&gt;-not really moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than the other Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizers of similar prices.</li>
            <li> I believe this product caused some new comedones on my face, which is why I knocked off the second star.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel my skin dry, and I don&#x27;t need as much powder as before.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> she highly recommended it, she said there is literally no difference from the much more expensive brands she&#x27;d tried.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels quite soft, actually!</li>
            <li> Soaks in similarly to the regular Sensitive Skin version.</li>
            <li> The SPF of the moisturizer makes the texture a little more gritty and heavy.</li>
            <li> It needs to be reapplied as sweat breaks it down as well as just the absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this one because it is less greasy and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny when I get to work.  </li>
            <li> There are so many other SPF moisturizers without irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I only put on a little bit of powder most days, and usually by the end of the day, my face would look shiny and feel extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I had really dry skin before, where it was flaking a lot, especially in my T-Zone, but now it&#x27;s evened out after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t break out in my T zone, but in the dry areas I still get flaking.  </li>
            <li> she said she just spent a fortune on some facial cream that she loves, but when she runs out, she&#x27;s going back to olay regenerist.  </li>
            <li> the spots may be small pimples, they are red dots that i developed after the second day of using it.  </li>
            <li> I hate moisturizers that feel greasy or slimy, but this is very light and soft.</li>
            <li> I overcome this by applying almond oil in the dry places before I moisturize so it doesn&#x27;t add additional oil.  </li>
            <li> a few days later i went to a different store--a target this time--and they didnt have it [my fav] either.  </li>
            <li> While I love that the smell of sunscreen reminds me of summer, I hate that in 24 hours the tip can dry up enough that the first bit on my finger is always hard.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me pale, with a white cast across my face, as physical sunscreens tend to do.</li>
            <li> In some other moisturizers, I had to wait to put on foundation or the rubbing action would make little</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive (maybe 2% of the products I&#x27;ve used in the past haven&#x27;t irritated my skin), but this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all, and it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It has lasted for a long time as I only need just a little for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years and never had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would only recommend this for those who have normal skin (for all dry, combo, and oily skin types, sorry, but just stick to a moisturizer and a sunscreen).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 24 hours since I last applied it, and the only part of my face that feels a little slick is my nose.</li>
            <li> This seems to dry quickly, it&#x27;s not too think or creamy, and it protects my skin.</li>
            <li> I have other of their products that I like.  </li>
            <li> After use, my skin get extremely oily.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not very good at appreciating the difference between different face care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon than at Walmart too ;)</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that it is slightly oilier and shinier on my skin than past bottles.</li>
            <li> - less greasy than other spf lotions out there</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is hard to get the last 1/4 of cream out of container.</li>
            <li> help blotchiness and the appearance of dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 or 6 brands, but I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and it&#x27;s the only one keeps me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the gas it took to get to the store I bought it from.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sometimes burns my eyes when I rub it into them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is Neutrogena quit making the tinted version.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena let me down with this product.  </li>
            <li> It balled up on my skin and flaked down onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> A little pricy is my only complaint</li>
            <li> The redness in my cheeks has slightly subsided.</li>
            <li> Bought it based on the previous reviews..</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a product with sun screen in it so that there is one less thing to worry</li>
            <li> For years, I avoided even using moisturizer because my face would be a greasy mess at the end of the day, whether or not the formula was \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; or formulated for greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day before I put on my slightly creamy-powder foundation, and it is a fantastic base.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my 12 year old who suffers with acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after washing my face or getting out of the pool.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel anything heavy on my face</li>
            <li> This cream has helped her a lot, and she even applies it after swimming if her face feels dried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is a waste of lotion and the tissue I wipe it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this version of Neutrogena Moisture for a few years after switching from the SPF 15 one.  </li>
            <li> a few other reviewers have complained about.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that some other reviewers complained about the lotion burning their skin, well, I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get why they would make a daytime moisturizer that makes a face look like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 pcs and sad to see that the expiry date is December 2015 just 4 months left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con- made me broke out in small ance bumbs</li>
            <li> I started to get small pimples after usage.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes have become very sensitive, and painful since using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative review at all.</li>
            <li> neither did my mom, who has complained about the smell of every moisturizer and sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not really set with me&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream lasts a long time, (it lasted her about a year,) and it never changed its consistency or got dirty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hate throwing away anything without fully using it, but this stuff is not going back on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily or sticky, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> it was a bit expensive, so</li>
            <li> I opened my package and was like wtf.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with anything by Nuetrogena?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find at a brick-and-mortar</li>
            <li> From a person who is literally afraid of pimples</li>
            <li> It also smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> but this product burned my face so badly.  </li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has a terrible chemical odor that lasted through the night, and even through the shower this morning.  </li>
            <li> it may not be horrible to others, i may just have a skin reaction to something in it, but the reaction is one i dont like</li>
            <li> It was terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is greate, I will continue using it and will told to somebody aboout it. My skin is now protect from sun and wether.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off.  The bottle said oil-free moisture cream.  I emailed Neutrogena customer service and they said they don&#x27;t make a cream, just a lotion.  It also smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena let me down with this product.  I was excited to find a reasonably priced moisturizer with SPF 30, but now the only time I use it is when I am doing something active outside and don&#x27;t care what I look like.  It absorbs nicely and feels good on my skin, but after an hour or two my face looks greasier than I have ever seen it look in my life.  It makes makeup melt off my face.  I hate this stuff.  But with the high SPF it is good to use when doing yard work or exercise.  Once it&#x27;s gone I will never buy it again.  I just don&#x27;t get why they would make a daytime moisturizer that makes a face look like an oil slick.  Yesterday I bought Cetaphil&#x27;s Dermacontrol Moisturizer with SPF 30 and look forward to trying it.  It claims to be an oil control moisturizer.  It&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon than at Walmart too ;)</li>
            <li> This product is oil free, but it feels super greasy. I&#x27;ve moved on to use the oil free moisture for sensitive skin and that works wonders for me :)</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. I have used Oil of Olay SPF 30 moisturizer, Purpose SPF 15, and Eucerin SPF30. This is the best of them all. I can apply my make-up over this without any interaction. In some other moisturizers, I had to wait to put on foundation or the rubbing action would make little \\&quot;boogers\\&quot; of make-up and moisturizer all over my face. This seems to dry quickly, it&#x27;s not too think or creamy, and it protects my skin. Plus, it&#x27;s a good price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the non-greasy feel of the 35 spf moisturizer.  Only complaint is that it is hard to get the last 1/4 of cream out of container.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but you can definitely feel like you&lt;br /&gt;just applied moisturizer. The SPF is good for me&lt;br /&gt;since I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars, I would.  I tried this product last night for the first and last time.  Immediately after applying it my face felt like I had just rubbed some sort of acid on it.  The burning sensation continued for hours.  Also, it has a terrible chemical odor that lasted through the night, and even through the shower this morning.  I will never use it again and it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer actually makes my skin feel soft and is great under my makeup. I picked it up at Target for ten dollars; one of the cheaper skin products for higher SPF. I don&#x27;t understand the negative review at all. I have combination skin and my skin doesn&#x27;t burn from this. And there&#x27;s no odor either. All in all great little thing to have.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever! It&#x27;s not oily or sticky, and it&#x27;s not too expensive. It also provides sunblock, and has highest rating for moisturizers by consumer reports.</li>
            <li> Excellent for daily use, especially on oily skin. It&#x27;s also UV protective.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have extremely oily skin. For years, I avoided even using moisturizer because my face would be a greasy mess at the end of the day, whether or not the formula was \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; or formulated for greasy skin. Recently I decided I that needed to start wearing sunscreen, and figured that something especially formulated for facial skin would be best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this works awesomely!! It doesn&#x27;t leave me pale, with a white cast across my face, as physical sunscreens tend to do. It&#x27;s virtually odorless. The redness in my cheeks has slightly subsided. My skin is even clearer than it was before (NO breakouts at all when I use this). And finally, it doesn&#x27;t leave grease pouring off my face at the end of the day. It&#x27;s been almost 24 hours since I last applied it, and the only part of my face that feels a little slick is my nose. My skin feels quite soft, actually!</li>
            <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dirty or clog your pores&lt;br /&gt; i Will buy this product again.  blah</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years now, and I absolutely love it. It protects my skin from the sun but it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy. I wear it under my make up every day and don&#x27;t plan to stop!</li>
            <li> Very good products.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer/sunscreen combination I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for the price. I had just run out of the moisturizer I usually use, and as the only store in the area that carries it anymore is on the other side of the city, I picked this up, just so I would have something until I could get more of the other. I won&#x27;t be getting the other again; this is far better.    I didn&#x27;t have to use very much and it absorbed quickly. My skin is extremely sensitive (maybe 2% of the products I&#x27;ve used in the past haven&#x27;t irritated my skin), but this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all, and it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily. I only put on a little bit of powder most days, and usually by the end of the day, my face would look shiny and feel extremely oily. That wasn&#x27;t the case with this. I have combination skin, so it can be a chore trying to keep the dryer parts moisturized and the oily parts from getting worse, but my skin looks and feels great at the end of the day when I use this. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, either, and I didn&#x27;t notice any bad/unusual smells - neither did my mom, who has complained about the smell of every moisturizer and sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.    I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this when the bottle I have runs out.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit greasy.. Bought it based on the previous reviews.. but it does the job..! keeps the skin moisturized but looks greasy for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product while I was on vacation (I had forgotten my regular SPF moisturizer).  I do NOT have sensitive skin at all but this product burned my face so badly.  I have never had a product hurt this much (OK maybe the super cheap foundation I bought once when I was a teenager LOL!)  I can&#x27;t imagine what this would feel like on a person with sensitive skin.  I was really surprised.  I usually think of Neutrogena as a good brand.  I have other of their products that I like.  There are so many other SPF moisturizers without irritating ingredients.  I would highly recommend trying something different.  Check Beautypedia for a list.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it is a great product.  Se has been using it for years, and continues to do so.</li>
            <li> i bought it for the clearance price, red tag deal at whatever store..  and im not using it anymore.  my face didnt burn like a few other reviewers have complained about.  but i did start to break out.  some bumps.  the spots may be small pimples, they are red dots that i developed after the second day of using it.  my face never breaks out so i dont know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the reason i tried this product is because the moisturizer that i do like was out of stock that day.  a few days later i went to a different store--a target this time--and they didnt have it [my fav] either.  so i needed facial cream.  i talked with a nice woman who was much older and had nice skin.  she happened to be there in the aisle and i needed some advice.  she said she just spent a fortune on some facial cream that she loves, but when she runs out, she&#x27;s going back to olay regenerist.  she highly recommended it, she said there is literally no difference from the much more expensive brands she&#x27;d tried.  it was a bit expensive, so i hope it&#x27;s worth it; but she was pretty supportive of it so im pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hate throwing away anything without fully using it, but this stuff is not going back on my face.  it may not be horrible to others, i may just have a skin reaction to something in it, but the reaction is one i dont like and therefore i will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ^^^ Mine was more of a bronze and silver tube and it was \\&quot;Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer\\&quot;. It has SPF 30 with soy ingredients \\&quot;to help blotchiness and the appearance of dark spots\\&quot;.  I opened my package and was like wtf. I decided to try it because its the middle of summer and I have no SPF products. It was very moisturizing and it smelled nice. I use it everyday after washing my face or getting out of the pool. I&#x27;m just glad that I like the product that isn&#x27;t being shown. Hoped this helped.</li>
            <li> I ordered this spf lotion because I&#x27;m outside walking to the train on most days and my skin needs protection and gets a bit dry. This stuff feels more like sunscreen than I hoped it would, but it does spread very easily and I can put it fairly close to my eyes without irritation. (Regular sunscreen seems to emanate stinging vapor or something). So, yeah, this stuff is pretty smooth and lotiony and I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Feels like regular lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, or cause breakouts. Love that it&#x27;s SPF 35. Isn&#x27;t waterproof or sweat proof.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day before I put on my slightly creamy-powder foundation, and it is a fantastic base. I use one pump for my whole face, and I love that it has the built in sunscreen (it never occurred to me that I was getting a bit of a sunburn on my one cheek that is always in the sun when I drive! This is helping that). I had really dry skin before, where it was flaking a lot, especially in my T-Zone, but now it&#x27;s evened out after about two weeks of use. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all which is great, and afterwards I just pat on my powder and it looks great! Definitely recommend! I&#x27;m now subscribing through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really like this, it gives my skin a smooth matte finish</li>
            <li> I use to use this moisturizer everytime after I washes my face and it never left me moisturized. I always still had dry flaky skin right after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the negative reviews for this product. I&#x27;m not arguing about that feedback, nor am I trying to dismiss these customer&#x27;s issues. I&#x27;m just very surprised they had a reaction to this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years and never had a bad reaction. My skin is very fair and somewhat sensitive, and this lotion feels just right to me. I hate moisturizers that feel greasy or slimy, but this is very light and soft. My face is too sensitive for tradional sunscreen, so I use this instead.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed at a better price than its name brand rivals.  I reapply probably three times a day so it goes quickly,  How about a larger bottle?  Small size does tuck nicely into my purse and stays there.</li>
            <li> Perfect lotion with sunblock</li>
            <li> I do like this moisturizer but it is not so great if you are in the inbetween stage of being oily and dry.  I definitely don&#x27;t break out in my T zone, but in the dry areas I still get flaking.  I overcome this by applying almond oil in the dry places before I moisturize so it doesn&#x27;t add additional oil.  This seems to work for me, but if you have very dry skin, opt for something more emollient.</li>
            <li> I have given my Asian skin many freckles from being irresponsible and not wearing any sunscreen for years, even while baking at the beach. I feel like this is too sunblock-y versus lotion-y but will continue to use for the sake of protection. There is a daytime lotion with 15 spf that feels and smells better but I feel it may not be enough.</li>
            <li> Due to my fair skin, my dermatologist recommended that I wear a daily moisturizer with SPF in order to protect my face. I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 or 6 brands, but I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and it&#x27;s the only one keeps me from breaking out. Even other brands that say they are non-comedogenic lead to breakouts for me (maybe it&#x27;s an allergic reaction to the ingredients), but this one has been tried and true. It&#x27;s light weight, smells good, isn&#x27;t overly greasy and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 pcs and sad to see that the expiry date is December 2015 just 4 months left. Suggest to check expiry date beofre buying.</li>
            <li> works very well agaisnt the suns rays</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to! I mix it with liquid foundation and use as a tinted moisturizer almost every day.</li>
            <li> non greasy so I don&#x27;t feel anything heavy on my face</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for me. It will not and can not be massaged into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products. Funny enough, my skin does not like this particular moisturizer (the one for sensitive skin is fine). I did not break out from this product, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it as much as others in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-SPF 35&lt;br /&gt;-dries matte&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-this dries out my skin. Then after about 2-3 hours, my skin becomes even more oily that I am naturally (to make up for the lack of moisture my skin has)&lt;br /&gt;-smell of sunscreen lingers after product dries (a minor con)&lt;br /&gt;-not really moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would only recommend this for those who have normal skin (for all dry, combo, and oily skin types, sorry, but just stick to a moisturizer and a sunscreen). I did put on another moisturizer and then this one, but I still have the same issues.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Moisture SPF 15 for twenty years. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with sun screen. I do have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with it burning or itching! I also have a sensitive nose and very much appreciate the fact it has no fragrance! Recently my dermatologist suggested I use a stronger SPF. Hmmm... what to do? And then I found the Neutrogena Moisture with 35 SPF. Perfect! So happy! Love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a moisturizer, but it feels and smells more like sunscreen. Actually it smells exactly like sunscreen. After use, my skin get extremely oily. It burns and makes me break out, it feels like the $3 foundation you get at the department stores. I&#x27;ve never had a product irritate my skin. Also, my eyes have become very sensitive, and painful since using it. Not worth the gas it took to get to the store I bought it from. Will not use this again.</li>
            <li> wish it smelled nice but works good</li>
            <li> So easy to put on this moisturizer every day, and have your sun protection too! My husband and I both use it.  Not greasy!</li>
            <li> It does the jib. Nothing to necessarily rave about...</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have used it for years; it has sufficient sunscreen, but doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or go on oily.</li>
            <li> My wife regularly uses it.</li>
            <li> I started developing rosacea about a year ago and I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer before and after I knew about my rosacea.  It doesn&#x27;t feel very greasy and absorbs well in my skin.  I really like that it is an SPF over 30 and it works against UVA/UVB.  I am thinking about trying the Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer again.  I think they both work great, but the Aveeno leaves a stinkier sulfur sunscreen smell on your skin. Don&#x27;t forget to reapply this moisturizer!  You don&#x27;t just put it on in the morning and it protects you all day.  It needs to be reapplied as sweat breaks it down as well as just the absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was not what I was looking for. It still broke me out, I decided I did not need to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Consistently great product for those with sensitive skin who also want an oil free product.</li>
            <li> I have combo acne prone skin so i am always looking to find products that are sensitive towards my skin. Unfortunately this product did not really set with me&lt;br /&gt;PRO- absorbs well&lt;br /&gt;  - less greasy than other spf lotions out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- made me broke out in small ance bumbs&lt;br /&gt;  not alcohal free&lt;br /&gt; i am returning this product</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is OK but the top that attaches to a spring came off as soon as I go it.  Now when I travel it leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my 12 year old who suffers with acne and dry skin. This cream has helped her a lot, and she even applies it after swimming if her face feels dried. This cream is great for any time of the day, but she prefers applying it after washing her face at night. It prevents tightness and dryness of skin, but doesn&#x27;t prevent peeling when used with anti-acne solutions. It leaves an oily residue for several minutes, (30 at the most,) but that doesn&#x27;t bother her a lot. It&#x27;s a nice, simple moisturizer-perfect for daily dryness. The packaging is very sleek and clean, and the cap is a twistable that makes you twist it before getting cream, which prevents cream leaks. This cream lasts a long time, (it lasted her about a year,) and it never changed its consistency or got dirty. Besides not preventing peeling, this cream is a great buy for people just looking for a simple moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with a great name.  How can you go wrong with anything by Nuetrogena?  Nice light feel, not oily or slimy and a nice light fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> Good value (size, SPF, etc) and although aging out of &#x27;oily Italian&#x27; skin, it feels great when applied. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this on my skin, feels really soft after use, but after a few hours my skin feels oily</li>
            <li> Good cream, especially for such price!</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35 for years but had run out. So for $28.00 I bought a jar of salon sold SPF 30 moisturizer. It was terrible! It balled up on my skin and flaked down onto my clothes. In the meantime my old standby Neutrogena arrived and will remain my first choice. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that it is slightly oilier and shinier on my skin than past bottles. I checked the formula and it was exactly the same except for one small change. Maybe that&#x27;s the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find at a brick-and-mortar so I occasionally order it from Amazon. It&#x27;s not greasy and does a decent job protecting from the sun. I am very sensitive to scents and this one is very light and dissipates almost immediately which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Thaks to the costumers than helped me, this is my second day using it, and love it. I don&#x27;t feel my skin dry, and I don&#x27;t need as much powder as before. Recomended</li>
            <li> For day to day use is ok, but no tratment</li>
            <li> Very good package and nice to use it.</li>
            <li> This a really nice Spf moisturizer. I have fair skin and always wear sunblock when exercising outside or at the beach, but I always neglected everyday spf. This product is light weight and smells normal, like a lighter version of standard Neutrogena sunblock. The smell fades fast so I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like sunblock all day. Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, but I generally have normal skin that doesn&#x27;t break out too often</li>
            <li> I started to get small pimples after usage. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;Currently i am using aveeno. works much better.</li>
            <li> While I love that the smell of sunscreen reminds me of summer, I hate that in 24 hours the tip can dry up enough that the first bit on my finger is always hard.  That is a waste of lotion and the tissue I wipe it on.  I will be trying a different one after this runs out.</li>
            <li> So easy to get exactly the amount you need with just a slight pump of the top button... the liquid is the consistency of hand lotion and rubs in so smoothly even on my manly arms. The SPF is just right for my blond hair , blue eyes, and fair skin protecting me everywhere I apply it. A little pricy is my only complaint but it was easy to find here on Amazon but not available in my local stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product when I was looking for a oil-free moisturizer with enough spf to use as an every day sunscreen. I am happy with the everyday use. it is very light, and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> This product has worked for me. My face looks clear and radiant. It has lasted for a long time as I only need just a little for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years now and is perfect for my normal skin plus the SPF 35 makes it complete.</li>
            <li> Simply it does its job, best bang for the buck. Don&#x27;t buy 40 dollars sun cream, and save your money by buying this.</li>
            <li> my wife likes to use it, not greasy and spf protection. she also likes the smell, pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer actually hurts.  It must use alcohol in order to be oil free, but if you have sensitive skin, it will burn about 10 minutes after you apply. Sometimes, it will feel all right when you put it on, but if you put anything over it, like a tinted moisturizer or foundation, all of a sudden the combination starts to burn.</li>
            <li> h must use every day, had cancer on face and donot want that again.This product goes on skin very well.lo</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion from Neutrogena its light weight, smells great (not overpowering), and I know that it won&#x27;t clog my pores. From a person who is literally afraid of pimples it&#x27;s a big deal to trust a face lotion. It&#x27;s a huge plus that it&#x27;s SPF 35 because I have very fair skin. I found that this price on Amazon is way better than what I can get at a typical drug store.</li>
            <li> The SPF of the moisturizer makes the texture a little more gritty and heavy. I think I will purchase the non-SPF versions in the future and apply my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I find the product as advertised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this version of Neutrogena Moisture for a few years after switching from the SPF 15 one.  I much prefer this one because it is less greasy and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny when I get to work.  It keeps my skin hydrated most of the day and is reasonably priced.  Can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Smells strongly of sunscreen, which is minus one star. Soaks in similarly to the regular Sensitive Skin version. Stings a bit for the first couple of uses. The bottle is smaller than the other Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizers of similar prices. I believe this product caused some new comedones on my face, which is why I knocked off the second star. Not my favorite sunscreen, but it works. I now use it exclusively for morning runs before I&#x27;ve showered and applied my regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and I&#x27;ve been using moisturizer for many years because without it my face would just dry up and peal off in a few hours. Also I&#x27;m not very good at appreciating the difference between different face care products. A moisturizer is a moisturizer for me. This is the reason why I don&#x27;t really have any loyalty for any particular brands, thus I always just buy the first fragrance-free moisturizer I find in the drug store. As the summer started I needed a new one so I decided to buy a product with sun screen in it so that there is one less thing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very satisfied with the lotion. It works great as a moisturizer, invisible, protects from the sun, fragrance-free, has convenient packaging. My only complaint is that it sometimes burns my eyes when I rub it into them. I noticed that some other reviewers complained about the lotion burning their skin, well, I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>
            <li> Again, I have used this for years.  My only complaint is Neutrogena quit making the tinted version.  I loved it but now I have to settle for the untinted version.</li>
            <li> Our family has used this product daily for protection from the sun for almost twenty years because it works, is not expensive, and it is quickly absorbed without feeling greasy.</li>
