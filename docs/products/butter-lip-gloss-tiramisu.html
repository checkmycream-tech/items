            <li>and I have access to whatever I want, and I choose this lip gloss as my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this gloss.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the color of this gloss.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and lasts about 1-2 hours with out eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>so I immediately wanted more colors.  </li>
            <li>I completely love this color.</li>
            <li>love the feel of this gloss</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>Love the formula.</li>
            <li>I love NYX makeup and this lip gloss was no exception.  </li>
            <li>I just love the soft buttery feel and the beautiful colors that they come in.  </li>
            <li>It has the perfect amount of color and keeps your lips super soft.</li>

            <li>Not only does it smell good, It looks good.</li>
            <li>Holds color and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Not too shiny, extremely smooth, and the color lasts for hours on end.</li>
            <li>color was a bit light for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are worth giving a try for the inexpensive price!</li>
            <li>NYX makes great glosses, and they are what I reach for a lot more than my more expensive lip products.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of taste, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It is the color I wanted (not really the color of the container, but I saw swatches), applies nicely and smoothly, and has decent staying power.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like tiramisu?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting more of these.</li>
            <li>This lip gloss does exactly what the name says.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Belfurt cosmetics!</li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky, and will show slightly lines if you, for example, press your lips together -- but that&#x27;s true with most glosses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>usually stick to NARS and Laura Mercier lip glosses, but Tiramisu is just as good as the ones I&#x27;ve bought at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I took 2 stars off because it&#x27;s really sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sticky-</li>
            <li>Although the color is really identical to what you see here on amazon, she was convinced it would look how it did in the blog.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>The color on my lips is gorgeous-my lip are naturally mauve, and this enhances with pretty coverage.</li>
            <li>It looks super sheer on me</li>
            <li>Your lips feel very soft and once again, buttery!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great color, not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t taste weird like some glosses can.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in other colors.</li>
            <li>and I swear it&#x27;s almost the exact same color.</li>
            <li>A little sticky if too much is applied but that actually goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty pigmented/pink lips as is, so I was worried that it would look strange on me.</li>
            <li>I love the color and only have to apply a few times a day.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency (it is a bit thick</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, just be aware that this product has no wrapper or barcode sealing it closed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how much I like these cheapy little glosses.  </li>
            <li>I got my first NYX butter gloss in an ipsy bag a few months ago.  </li>

            <li> I got my first NYX butter gloss in an ipsy bag a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale, but I seen other women wearing this online and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I will say, I feel that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> Also if there is wind and you have long hair it gets all over it and</li>
            <li> The other reason is that I had to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li> If I kept my hair down, inevitably it got stuck to my lips.</li>
            <li> Not much in the moisture category, either.</li>
            <li> Once I put it on over some pink lipstick, however, it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other lip glosses.</li>
            <li> The color is less brown than it appears here</li>
            <li> Stays on for a few hours before needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer and went on with my business drinking water talking eating and 3 hrs later it was still on my lip&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Color is just a bit too pale for my coloring.</li>
            <li> It was not good, it smelled weird it was not worth my buck.</li>
            <li> Too bad the blogger made such a blunder.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad about the color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I hate lip glosses that are so glossy and sticky  ,</li>
            <li> and I hate that!</li>
            <li> Its a terrible product!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the color and shine</li>
            <li> This is my personal opinion after trying to wear this lippy several times. It smells delicious. Exactly like tiramisu? No. Not a lot of taste, but not unpleasant. The color on my lips is gorgeous-my lip are naturally mauve, and this enhances with pretty coverage. The sponge-ish applicator is perfect, making application simple and decently precise. I took 2 stars off because it&#x27;s really sticky. If I kept my hair down, inevitably it got stuck to my lips. The other reason is that I had to constantly reapply. If I took more than one sip of coffee, I had to put more on. Not much in the moisture category, either. Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Nice lip color it goes well with my complexion.</li>
            <li> Lip Butter is the perfect name for this gloss. Not too shiny, extremely smooth, and the color lasts for hours on end. No cons about it.</li>
            <li> Love NYX Butter Gloss. Great colors and not sticky like some lip glosses. Will definitely buy more in other colors.</li>
            <li> Very pretty neutral color that looks great on.  A little sticky if too much is applied but that actually goes away pretty quickly.  Stays on for a few hours before needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> I intend on getting one in every color!! They also smell amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> This Is thr best nude lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever bought! I absolutely LOVE the smell! It is very nice buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> This is lip gloss with a great price and a nice shine!  NYX Butter Lip Gloss has not taste...which is great!  It is also long-lasting.  On the down-side, it has that sticky feel a lot of the lower priced lip glosses have.  It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale, but I seen other women wearing this online and wanted to try it. It looks super sheer on me and I&#x27;m sad about the color. I still use it over lipsticks that I have. But I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. It&#x27;s also very sticky- and I hate that!</li>
            <li> When I opened this gloss and swatched it, I was hesitant to wear it - it seemed too beige-y for my lips. I have pretty pigmented/pink lips as is, so I was worried that it would look strange on me. Once I put it on over some pink lipstick, however, it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stick to NARS and Laura Mercier lip glosses, but Tiramisu is just as good as the ones I&#x27;ve bought at Sephora. I&#x27;m definitely getting more of these.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss does exactly what the name says. It goes on like butter.  The colors are beautiful and I love the consistancy.  I have them in every color they make. I am a lip gloss junkie and I even sell Avon products on the side as a hobby because I love makeup and I have access to whatever I want, and I choose this lip gloss as my favorite.  I just love the soft buttery feel and the beautiful colors that they come in.  Your lips feel very soft and once again, buttery!  Try it, you can&#x27;t lose with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss. It has the perfect amount of color and keeps your lips super soft. I want every color</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the color of this gloss. It goes on nice and smooth and lasts about 1-2 hours with out eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> This was my first nyx product and I really love it happy I got it I hate lip glosses that are so glossy and sticky  , but this lip gloss is just perfect  not to glossy and NOT STICKY I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got my first NYX butter gloss in an ipsy bag a few months ago.  It was amazing so I immediately wanted more colors.  I love the Tiramisu!  I think it would look good on anybody!</li>
            <li> Nice color, good product!  I love the color and only have to apply a few times a day.  Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> i LOVEEEEE this lip gloss i recommed this to all the girls ... nude brown but perfect</li>
            <li> I completely love this color. I will say, I feel that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long, I feel like I have to keep reapplying but not a big deal for the price. I also feel that almost all the colors are the same, i have Tiramisu and Creme Brulee and I swear it&#x27;s almost the exact same color.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, just be aware that this product has no wrapper or barcode sealing it closed. Unfortunately, this was an issue for me. If I had realized, I would of picked a different product to buy.</li>
            <li> It was not good, it smelled weird it was not worth my buck. Do not buy it! It leaves streaks and when you lick your lips the taste isn&#x27;t pleasant. Also if there is wind and you have long hair it gets all over it and your hair becomes sticky! Its a terrible product!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Holds color and easy to apply. Color is just a bit too pale for my coloring. Otherwise it is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I like these cheapy little glosses.  You can adjust the color with your lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;They are worth giving a try for the inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as she had seen it on a beauty blog.  Although the color is really identical to what you see here on amazon, she was convinced it would look how it did in the blog.  Too bad the blogger made such a blunder.  My daughter kept it anyway as it is still a nice neutral.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty and it feels good on my lips, not sticky at all. It also smells good!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this when it came in.  It is the color I wanted (not really the color of the container, but I saw swatches), applies nicely and smoothly, and has decent staying power.  It is a bit sticky, and will show slightly lines if you, for example, press your lips together -- but that&#x27;s true with most glosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I dislike is the smell.  Tiramisu, the dessert, is coffee-based, and I can definitely smell coffee in the lip gloss.  Since I don&#x27;t like coffee, this is a downside for me.</li>
            <li> Great color, not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t taste weird like some glosses can. NYX makes great glosses, and they are what I reach for a lot more than my more expensive lip products.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, It looks good.It&#x27;s not like other lip glosses.It has a lipstick feel to it and that&#x27;s why I like it.I put on a thin layer and went on with my business drinking water talking eating and 3 hrs later it was still on my lip&#x27;s.I&#x27;m really impressed with it.RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitively taste like Tiramisu cake! it&#x27;s smell delicious too. It&#x27;s a beautiful buttery color and at a very inexpensive price. Thanks again Belfurt cosmetics!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> The color is great, like a light brownish-pink, for fair to medium skin tones. The drawback is that the lip gloss is sticky.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Nice nude color for women of color!</li>
            <li> love the feel of this gloss &#x3D;)  color was a bit light for me tho, will try a different color.</li>
            <li> love this lip gloss; not sticky and glides on easily</li>
            <li> Came it great timing, great product affordable price!</li>
            <li> Love the formula. The color is less brown than it appears here and it&#x27;s the perfect nude for people who have pigmented lips.</li>
            <li> I love NYX makeup and this lip gloss was no exception.  I love the consistency (it is a bit thick but it doesn&#x27;t bother me) and the color.  Highly recommend.</li>
