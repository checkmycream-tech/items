            <li> This product may sting a little at first.</li>
            <li> Really works well and long lasting with wet or dry hair, and there is no fragrance to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (read snarls after washing) and a few spritz of this straightner</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry</li>
            <li> I use it whenever my hair seems to be getting a bit dry and it keeps the condition of the hair without any greasiness.</li>
            <li> Since it takes so little to work, one bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the spray nozzle jams and the liquid leaks out, not pleased that it is getting wasted.</li>
            <li> A few spritzes on the bottom half of my long hair while I&#x27;m blowdrying smoothes everything down, and a little spray over the crown of my hair to finish.</li>
            <li> Not sure what was in this bottle.  </li>
            <li> This liquid appeared to be too thick to spray through sprayer.  </li>
            <li> What was weird was when I switched liquid to bottle that was previously worker</li>
            <li> Tough choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice and both times the spray failed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after my stylist used it on me and we were both shocked at the results afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Also helps when the weather is very cold to keep your hair controlled</li>

            <li> This liquid appeared to be too thick to spray through sprayer.  Not sure what was in this bottle.  What was weird was when I switched liquid to bottle that was previously worker it quit working.</li>
            <li> This product does work and once heat is applied all stickiness dissipates. The cons for me were the presence of \\&quot;cones\\&quot; (Silicone type substances)and I wish the ingredients were listed out. This stuff also has a STRONG smell.</li>

This helps my hair be much more controllable and I can get it straighter than I ever have been able to before.  My hair tends to be dry and I get split ends very easily.

            <li> My mom used to work at a salon and she gave me a sample of this to help tame my fine, fly-away, split-endy hair. I love it! A few spritzes on the bottom half of my long hair while I&#x27;m blowdrying smoothes everything down, and a little spray over the crown of my hair to finish. Very lightweight for fine hair that is easily weighted down by product. Beats the frizzies and humidity in windy Chicago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice and both times the spray failed. The product is good, but if you can&#x27;t get it out, does not help much!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It makes my hair so easy to handle and make straight.  However, it breaks my skin out.  Tough choice!</li>
            <li> The product is good, however each time I buy it the pump breaks or clogs.  I have to transfer the product to another spray container to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great followup product for Keratin aftercare, or for those with only slightly frizzy hair.  It kept my hair frizz free, yet allowed body.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have been happy with the results obtained.  It&#x27;s also recommened for the Keratin hair treatment I had.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the spray nozzle jams and the liquid leaks out, not pleased that it is getting wasted.</li>
            <li> This product may sting a little at first. But overall I like it. It works great. It tames flyaways and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I loved using it, but wanted to find a lower price than my salon offered.  After one use, the spray nozzle clogged and it wouldn&#x27;t spray.  I tried transferring to another bottle and realized it wasn&#x27;t the sprayer, but the product was not quite the same as what my salon offered.  Product was super sticky and didn&#x27;t do the same as the one I bought from my salon.  I would not recomend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loves the product and it&#x27;s at a much cheaper price than at the salon.</li>
