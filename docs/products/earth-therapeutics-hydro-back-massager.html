            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice, I have to admit, I want one now.</li>
            <li>The brush looked so nice and looked high quality.</li>
            <li>The wood handle is thick and strong with a wonderful rubberized grip.</li>
            <li>length and tuft are useful.</li>
            <li>They usually last several months and they work great.</li>
            <li>This happened in the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>but most of the heads on the others I have tried do not last.</li>
            <li>This is not the first of these that I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>So my first one lasted like 8 months</li>
            <li>and then the handle broke, so I ordered another one and the handle broke first use</li>
            <li>mesh part feel apart from brush even before getting wet, cheap product, nice handle, but i did not need the handle to wash my back</li>
            <li>and this guy has had two shoulder operations and obviously finds it comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the poof part looked big and full.  </li>
            <li>However, as per the Customer Return Policy you must return this item to your local Organic Market for a full refund or replacement.  </li>
            <li>While they&#x27;re not expensive, I certainly expect them to stand up to regular use.</li>
            <li>But if it falls apart as with the reviewer who left a one-star review (I left two stars because two of three were fine</li>
            <li>well it was brand new when I got it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a $5 item and they refused to send a new one to replace the one I bought.  </li>
            <li>the mesh comes loose too quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy back brush.</li>
            <li>We bought this to replace one we already had that was old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a old one that was worn out.</li>
            <li>The 2nd and 3rd fell apart and unraveled on their first use.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows a rubber grip on the handle but the one received had a bare wood handle.  </li>
            <li>, i need the handle to reach my back, the mesh part feel apart completely.</li>
            <li>Of course I no longer had my receipt after 6 weeks (nor does the local natural foods supermarket take back items after 30 days)</li>

            <li> Have not had this product very long, and is already starting to mold.</li>
            <li> I want it long</li>

            <li> Once bit and twice shy, but twice bit and we&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> Sad to report that it&#x27;s the skimpiest saddest bath brush EVER!  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> He got used to this brush and I can&#x27;t ween him off. It&#x27;s pretty nice, I have to admit, I want one now.</li>
            <li> This item took over two weeks to get here and had what looks like a logo piece or something on the front missing.  And after about two weeks of using it, it has now come apart.  The whole material piece has come undone and is now useless. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!</li>
            <li> Good sturdy brush,and does everything I need it too.  I like the wood handle of a plastic handle and rubber grip</li>
            <li> I bought three of them. The 1st was great and lasted 6 months. The 2nd and 3rd fell apart and unraveled on their first use.  No quality control so cannot recommend and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and withing 5 minutes of use it fell apart and I contacted seller to refund my money and they told me they do not refund used items....well it was brand new when I got it and it was used less than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> The handle broke at the grip where they had cut out the wood to keep it in place.  This happened in the first week of use.  The reason I give it 3 stars is the after trimming the wood and sliding the grip on the shortened handle it worked well as a short brush.  The head is great and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am torn about buying another.  I want it long but most of the heads on the others I have tried do not last.</li>
            <li> I purchased two backbrushes. One of them came untied after just 3 uses. While they&#x27;re not expensive, I certainly expect them to stand up to regular use.</li>
            <li> product met expectations</li>
            <li> This is not the first of these that I&#x27;ve ordered. I have used these for years and I keep coming back</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed. The brush looked so nice and looked high quality. I purchased it last year and my husband used it for 2 weeks and the brush unraveled. Because it looked so nice I purchased another on this Christmas, hoping it had just been a flaw, and when my husband pulled it out of the box to feel the brush, it fell apart in his hands. Once bit and twice shy, but twice bit and we&#x27;re finished. 2 purchases down the drain.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy back brush. The wood handle is thick and strong with a wonderful rubberized grip. The nylon used is not scratchy and it has a long reach. Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> poor quality the mesh comes loose too quickly. nice grip and reach though otherwise reasonably useful but for a short while not likely to last a year</li>
            <li> It arrived SO quickly and is a great, quality product,</li>
            <li> The picture shows a rubber grip on the handle but the one received had a bare wood handle.  Not Earth Therapeutics Ergo Form Brush.  Seemed to be bait and switch</li>
            <li> my only thing i did&#x27;t like was the handle could have been longer. the grip on the handle helped when you have soapy hands</li>
            <li> My favorite. Head held on well as other brands fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Not as pictured.  Without silicone grip which was on my prior one.&lt;br /&gt;Silicon grip gets moldy so better without.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace one we already had that was old. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great and really keeps in good condition in a very humid bathroom!</li>
            <li> Have not had this product very long, and is already starting to mold. Going to have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> mesh part feel apart from brush even before getting wet, cheap product, nice handle, but i did not need the handle to wash my back, i need the handle to reach my back, the mesh part feel apart completely.</li>
            <li> AMAZON ASKED ME TO REVIEW MY RECENT PURCHASE OF THIS BACK BRUSH.  SO I SAID \\&quot;honey....do you like that bath brush I bought you?\\&quot; He replied.. \\&quot;Yes, yes I do a lot!\\&quot;  Sooo....there ya go folks....and this guy has had two shoulder operations and obviously finds it comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It works good, serves the purpose its intended for. Just a bit pricey for what you get. I like it, just woulda liked it better $5 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the poof part looked big and full.  Sad to report that it&#x27;s the skimpiest saddest bath brush EVER!  I used it only a few times and basically it was like stabbing myself with a sharp wooden stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for me.  Easy grip handle and is super handy to use because my arthritis doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a old one that was worn out. I was disappointed that, although I ordered the same item, it did not resemble the previous one. There was no rubber hand grip on the wooden handle. The rubber hand grip helps me hold on to it while scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li> Worked great until it broke. Handle is very weak. Not recommended for heavy scrubbers.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  rubber grip helps keep it from sliding out of your hands when showering.  length and tuft are useful.</li>
            <li> So my first one lasted like 8 months and then the handle broke, so I ordered another one and the handle broke first use, I will be trying something else now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these. They usually last several months and they work great. However, the last one I got fell apart after 6 weeks of use. It looks like the mesh at the end of the stick was not tied on tightly at the factory. Of course I no longer had my receipt after 6 weeks (nor does the local natural foods supermarket take back items after 30 days) so I wrote to Earth Therapeutics who replied \\&quot;We apologize for the experience you have had with one of our product.  However, as per the Customer Return Policy you must return this item to your local Organic Market for a full refund or replacement.  You can send us a picture of the product with UPC code and a copy of the receipt for our quality team review. Also note, these brushes tend to last from three to six months depending on how often they are used and stored.\\&quot;  Not sure how I would still have a tag with the UPC code that I threw away the day I started to use the brush. The \\&quot;as per the Customer Return Policy\\&quot; is something companies say but it&#x27;s ridiculous.  They made up the policy.  It&#x27;s a $5 item and they refused to send a new one to replace the one I bought.  Heck of a company.  Bottom line-- if it works it will work well.  A five star item.  But if it falls apart as with the reviewer who left a one-star review (I left two stars because two of three were fine but the company was terrible to deal with when there was a problem), you are on your own.  It&#x27;s a ten dollar gamble.</li>
