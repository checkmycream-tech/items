            <li>The powder brush does a great job picking up product and blending it in.</li>

            <li>Really nice airbush finish!</li>
            <li>Great variety of sizes &amp; types -  good value</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, that&#x27;s the biggest reason why I just couldn&#x27;t resist buying them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Ecotools brushes for their excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>They look very nice, are good quality</li>
            <li>This is a great set, great quality and look nice too.</li>
            <li>great quality, even better price!</li>
            <li>These work just as good as the Sephora brand</li>
            <li>Good for travel I guess.</li>
            <li>They could be good as travel brushes</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, but you need good ones.</li>
            <li>... somewhat good condition..</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use these for allover application, but they&#x27;re good brushes nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Bought them at a good price.</li>
            <li>But if you just want some cute travel brushes, these are a beautiful option.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pretty and the bristles are the amazing quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Ecotools, but it&#x27;s not their best set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>Sooooooo cute!</li>
            <li>If you are okay with the size, just buy it!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this set!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>They are labeled and come in a box type thing with a flapping lid and each brush has it&#x27;s own spot.</li>
            <li>I liked the explanation for the use and application of each brush printed inside the lid.</li>
            <li>The buffing brush seems like it will do a nice job.</li>
            <li>they work really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice set.  </li>
            <li>Really nice brushes.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality and good price, rarely do I get one that sheds.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and apply makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li>A very thoughtful stocking stuffer for a makeup person.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a very important part of your make up.</li>
            <li>I use the foundation brush the most.</li>
            <li>I love ecotools.</li>
            <li>but then i fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>cute compact brushes love the colors.  </li>
            <li>Ecotools brushes that work as well and cover more surface area if that is what you need.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>They dont shed and the price is ok for the set.</li>
            <li>From top of the bristles to the bottom of the handle, each brush measures 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) in length.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a travel sized brush set lol!</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>I love love love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>though I prefer to use the smaller one as an eye shadow crease brush) and the buffing concealer brush is particularly excellent-</li>
            <li>While the powder brush does work for powder, it is more appropriate as a blush brush.</li>
            <li>The stand out of this kit is the foundation buffing brush, it is actually the best I&#x27;ve ever tried for applying and blending foundation.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>They do have quite a strong noticeable scent to them, but I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve washed them a couple more times that will begin to fade.</li>
            <li>and I got them for a pretty good price on their website.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very soft to the face.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and work great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very easy to clean because they&#x27;re compact.</li>
            <li>when these brushes arrived I was expecting them to ne bigger than they are, however they are still absolutely brilliant.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and because they were so cheap I was not expecting to.</li>
            <li>think the colorful metal on the handles where the brush meets the wood, is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how soft they are, they make applying face make up so easy and flawless.</li>
            <li>very light weight and full coverage.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>That makes it easy to gift them or take them on the go.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean them before using because it broke me out when I tried it without washing it.</li>
            <li>Compact, which makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Love theses brushes they don&#x27;t shred at all easy to put On makeup and easy to clean</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong, so</li>
            <li>If these brushes would have been full size, they would have been a five star for sure...</li>
            <li>compact and easy to fit into your make up bag and tote along in your purse for a night on the town</li>
            <li>These brushes are cute, small, and blend wonderfully.</li>
            <li>but there fine</li>
            <li>That would be fine, if it weren&#x27;t for the price paid.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense, very soft and feel good to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>perfect little set with the softest bristles to ever touch your face.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>So nice I thought they were real &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These would be great if the foundation &amp; powder brushes were larger....</li>
            <li>This set is nicely boxed and nestled in convenient storage to lessen drawer or travel bag real estate.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes work great for doing eyeshadow and under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>The bigger ones are really great for applying bronzer and contouring my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality and soft.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, they are just the right size.</li>
            <li>sometimes it is better to spend good money in one brush than try to purchase more for less.</li>
            <li>Great brushes as Eco Tools always is however if you are looking for full size brushes I suggest you try a different set from Eco Tools.</li>
            <li>Small but perfect for my makeup and my purse.</li>
            <li>The reviews say they are small, but I think they are perfect size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The small buffer brush is perfect for concealer either powder or cream.</li>
            <li>The fun colors are just an added bonus!</li>
            <li>Like the unique design</li>
            <li>The brush heads are full and soft, apply your cream, liquid &amp; powder cosmetics easily and evenly, and clean up nicely, while retaining their shapes.  </li>
            <li>The short handles aren&#x27;t pleasant to work with.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality, very soft.</li>
            <li>The ferrules are beautiful but there are other full size</li>
            <li>I love them very soft brushes and easy to cary on as they are travel size ..</li>
            <li>Super soft and luxurious, and I love the leaf detailing!</li>
            <li>I thought these were a full make up brush set</li>
            <li>A lady in Walgreen was telling me about this brushes I had to try I love them for real</li>
            <li>You will find the bristles to be wonderfully pliable and not the least scratchy.</li>
            <li>For some reason I bought this set thinking that they were full sizes, but they&#x27;re travel size brushes.</li>
            <li>The full powder brush, largest one in the set, measures 1 and 1/8 of inch (3 cm) at the widest part of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made BIG brushes with the same cute design, but they good for traveling or my purse :)</li>
            <li>Yes, the handles are short and the heads aren&#x27;t very big at all, but that makes them absolutely perfect for throwing in my purse for touch-ups on the go.</li>
            <li>super brushes..</li>
            <li>quick shipping .  </li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth, they make my makeup application so much easier and my makeup looks more even and smooth.</li>
            <li>but they are very soft and work perfectly fine, would recommend if you are going to use it as a travel set!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the designs on the brush are very pretty</li>
            <li>But I do use it to apply a light dusting of my translucent eye shadow, and that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>They are super short and work a lot better as shadow application than foundation!</li>
            <li>they are very soft i love them</li>
            <li>Such cute packaging!</li>
            <li>Received package quickly than expected which is good</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes, I have no complaints plus for the price I am surprised with the good quality.</li>
            <li>Great little brushes.  </li>
            <li>These are cute and soft.</li>
            <li>wanted to use something more natural on my face.  </li>
            <li>The larger three of the five brushes are definitely not the ideal size for their intended purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, and are both well made and cute.  </li>
            <li>but so far i am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I only own Ecotools brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall nice though.</li>
            <li>They were a lot smaller than I expected but the quality of the brushes are superb.</li>
            <li>Honestly I got this kit just for the buffing concealer brush, but the other brushes are really nice and soft too.</li>
            <li>It makes me happy to see them and use them and they meet my purposes well enough, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price, can not get things like this locally for anywhere near this price</li>
            <li>Okay, so these little brushes are pretty adorable.</li>
            <li>Also, the bonus is that the packaging they come in is actually a small hardcover &amp;#34;book&amp;#34; storage case, which makes this very handy for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Great little brushes!!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I love EcoTools however, I recently purchased this set from Target.  </li>
            <li>they are SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li>The purple one will probably sit unused and I&#x27;m sure I could find a use for the blue one, but it&#x27;s not likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave this three stars because they seem well made, and of course the pretty ferrules that prompted me to purchase them.</li>
            <li>I think they would have done better making a fancy version of their essential eye set.</li>
            <li>they are small and great for travel brushes are made very well</li>
            <li>Love this company and my second time buying a brush set from them.</li>
            <li>They would make for better travel brushes because the travel brushes (eye brush set) they do have are even smaller than these.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to a seasoned makeup user.</li>
            <li>I was at my local superstore and noticed this set sitting out by itself and couldn&#x27;t find any more of them</li>
            <li>so I am really glad I got the last one.</li>
            <li>Gave these to my granddaughter for xmas, she likes them very much and very pretty colors on the handles, brush&#x27;s are very soft..</li>
            <li>A very cute little travel kit.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and these feel very gentle on my face and don&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>She said these are good for traveling since they&#x27;re small.</li>
            <li>Very soft after first use and does the job!</li>
            <li>The little designs are so cute!</li>
            <li>With the smaller handles, it&#x27;s easy to blend the concealer</li>
            <li>no one&#x27;s face is that small lol except my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>Love these because they’re small and fit in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love EcoTools, and as always, these brushes were soft and cute; however, they were just too small</li>
            <li>Overall nice looking soft brushes, I would recommend if looking into a new mini-travel brushes.</li>
            <li>nice little brush set</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find a really good face brush like that Sephora one.</li>
            <li>Although they still have the great quality of Ecotools, they need to be broken in a bit before they really pick up product well.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really like them they have held up well and do not lose bristles.</li>
            <li>foundation brush blends product real well.</li>
            <li>Very petite, though.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would specify the size here.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like them, and</li>
            <li>it blends concealer with absorbing it.</li>
            <li>They are well-made, don&#x27;t seem to be shedding, and blend my cosmetics very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes were a gift, recipient says they are just as good as more expensive brands she has tried!  </li>
            <li>Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>A little too small but the quality is awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although most of the brushes are small for their intended purposes, and even a little small for the purposes I&#x27;ve found for them, they work okay and are definitely great for on-the-go touch ups where you don&#x27;t want to lug full-sized brushes around.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some fun, pretty brushes for touch-up purposes these are definitely for you.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>Great soft brushes I thought they would be a little bigger</li>
            <li>However, even though they are small and travel-sized, they are amazing.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is the pretty design on each handle...a classy touch.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re awesome and small enough to fit in the same bag with the other set</li>
            <li>brushes looked nice smaller than i expected it to be</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are small but it was exactly what I was looking for &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I was planning on buying some for my Mom and Sister for their Birthday, but they already ran out on Ecotools main website</li>
            <li>The product feels very soft n gentle against your skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I would still highly recommend buying any Eco Tools brushes.</li>
            <li>I like the tiny flat top brush</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a professional set that is well made and smartly designed.</li>
            <li>also love that these brushes come in a little book, per say.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I was wrong.</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a set of long handled, full sized brushes, this is not the set for you.  </li>
            <li>They are tiny, but I kind of like that since it&#x27;s what kept the cost down</li>
            <li>these brushes are very soft and high quality.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting brushes that are professional quality for applying and buffing your foundation every morning, you may want to go elsewhere and splurge on something a little more practical.</li>
            <li>but when I got it the box isnt even new</li>
            <li>It comes as it shows and for those who are new to using brushes they have descriptions on how to use them and why.</li>
            <li>I needed new travel brushes and was hoping these would work for me.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if that buffing brush was sold on its own, I would buy 5.</li>
            <li>I love these little brushes!</li>
            <li>(I love Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer) and dust on a little finishing powder and my dark circles are erased without emphasizing fine lines or getting that weird too bright undereye circle.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves make-up and these brushes are so soft and well made for the money!</li>
            <li>I love Ecotools brushes &amp; this set is extremely small.</li>
            <li>They are nice brushes, they&#x27;re soft and fairly good quality the only down side to thus set is that they are very small!!</li>
            <li>Brushes are really pretty but super small.</li>
            <li>The powder brush doesn&#x27;t distribute the right amount of pressed or loose powder , foundation brush makes my foundation streak  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the brushes do the job, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>its soft</li>
            <li>I wish that they came in a soft case rather in this box</li>
            <li>They are soft and not harsh to your face when using.</li>
            <li>The concealer brush and powder brush are my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>Really they deserve one or two for being such an impractical set.</li>
            <li>and they are not so soft as my Charm Pro Kabuki.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, they hold product well...</li>
            <li>This is a good travel kit, I returned them, sorry just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super silky soft, think are actually very comparable in terms of quality to a set I paid $60 for at a major beauty store a few years ago.</li>
            <li>The usage guide inside the inner cover is also very handy for beginners or for anyone who wants to know which brushes were designed to do what (though one can use the brushes for cosmetics outside of the recommendations on the box without any ill effect, as I have).  </li>
            <li>I do like these brushes they are very soft little to no shedding the furils are very pretty</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the flat or paddle type foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the EcoTools brushes, especially the eye brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any brushed from EcoTools.</li>
            <li>They do the job and don&#x27;t shed (which is a plus) but I have to spend a HUGE amount of time with these as they only cover half inch at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two biggest and the smallest (pink, brown, and green) are the most practical.</li>
            <li>Most brushes are hard for me to do my eye makeup with because they are too long.</li>
            <li>What surprised me when I opened the box was how tiny the brushes are!!!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure why I thought they were going to be full size.</li>
            <li>two pointed brushes are good for eye shadow but the flat one is a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li>For overnight travel, though, I would need to add my large Eco-tools kabuki brush to the mix in order to apply my Bare Minerals loose powder foundation to my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the two largest sizes aren&#x27;t very useful sizes (too big for eye shadow, too small for anything else).  </li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, the foundation brush takes some work to get your whole face covered.</li>
            <li>These brushes are smaller than I expected but still get the job done and very well done at that.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on little - be aware that these are travel sized.</li>
            <li>brushes are really soft too,the texture feel plush and like some high end brushes I have used in the past and a fraction of the cost.</li>

            <li> Great for contouring eye shadow, cover up face make up.</li>
            <li> The powder brush does a great job picking up product and blending it in.</li>

            <li> Really nice airbush finish!</li>
            <li> Great variety of sizes &amp; types -  good value</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, that&#x27;s the biggest reason why I just couldn&#x27;t resist buying them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Ecotools brushes for their excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> They look very nice, are good quality</li>
            <li> This is a great set, great quality and look nice too.</li>
            <li> great quality, even better price!</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the Sephora brand</li>
            <li> Good for travel I guess.</li>
            <li> They could be good as travel brushes</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, but you need good ones.</li>
            <li> ... somewhat good condition..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these for allover application, but they&#x27;re good brushes nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Bought them at a good price.</li>
            <li> But if you just want some cute travel brushes, these are a beautiful option.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pretty and the bristles are the amazing quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Ecotools, but it&#x27;s not their best set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Sooooooo cute!</li>
            <li> If you are okay with the size, just buy it!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this set!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> They are labeled and come in a box type thing with a flapping lid and each brush has it&#x27;s own spot.</li>
            <li> I liked the explanation for the use and application of each brush printed inside the lid.</li>
            <li> The buffing brush seems like it will do a nice job.</li>
            <li> they work really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice set.  </li>
            <li> Really nice brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are good quality and good price, rarely do I get one that sheds.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and apply makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> A very thoughtful stocking stuffer for a makeup person.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a very important part of your make up.</li>
            <li> I use the foundation brush the most.</li>
            <li> I love ecotools.</li>
            <li> but then i fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> cute compact brushes love the colors.  </li>
            <li> Ecotools brushes that work as well and cover more surface area if that is what you need.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> They dont shed and the price is ok for the set.</li>
            <li> From top of the bristles to the bottom of the handle, each brush measures 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) in length.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a travel sized brush set lol!</li>
            <li> love them.</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> though I prefer to use the smaller one as an eye shadow crease brush) and the buffing concealer brush is particularly excellent-</li>
            <li> While the powder brush does work for powder, it is more appropriate as a blush brush.</li>
            <li> The stand out of this kit is the foundation buffing brush, it is actually the best I&#x27;ve ever tried for applying and blending foundation.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> They do have quite a strong noticeable scent to them, but I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve washed them a couple more times that will begin to fade.</li>
            <li> and I got them for a pretty good price on their website.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very soft to the face.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and work great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very easy to clean because they&#x27;re compact.</li>
            <li> when these brushes arrived I was expecting them to ne bigger than they are, however they are still absolutely brilliant.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and because they were so cheap I was not expecting to.</li>
            <li> think the colorful metal on the handles where the brush meets the wood, is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how soft they are, they make applying face make up so easy and flawless.</li>
            <li> very light weight and full coverage.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> That makes it easy to gift them or take them on the go.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean them before using because it broke me out when I tried it without washing it.</li>
            <li> Compact, which makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Love theses brushes they don&#x27;t shred at all easy to put On makeup and easy to clean</li>
            <li> and they are still going strong, so</li>
            <li> If these brushes would have been full size, they would have been a five star for sure...</li>
            <li> compact and easy to fit into your make up bag and tote along in your purse for a night on the town</li>
            <li> These brushes are cute, small, and blend wonderfully.</li>
            <li> but there fine</li>
            <li> That would be fine, if it weren&#x27;t for the price paid.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense, very soft and feel good to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> perfect little set with the softest bristles to ever touch your face.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> So nice I thought they were real &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These would be great if the foundation &amp; powder brushes were larger....</li>
            <li> This set is nicely boxed and nestled in convenient storage to lessen drawer or travel bag real estate.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes work great for doing eyeshadow and under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> The bigger ones are really great for applying bronzer and contouring my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality and soft.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are just the right size.</li>
            <li> sometimes it is better to spend good money in one brush than try to purchase more for less.</li>
            <li> Great brushes as Eco Tools always is however if you are looking for full size brushes I suggest you try a different set from Eco Tools.</li>
            <li> Small but perfect for my makeup and my purse.</li>
            <li> The reviews say they are small, but I think they are perfect size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The small buffer brush is perfect for concealer either powder or cream.</li>
            <li> The fun colors are just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Like the unique design</li>
            <li> The brush heads are full and soft, apply your cream, liquid &amp; powder cosmetics easily and evenly, and clean up nicely, while retaining their shapes.  </li>
            <li> The short handles aren&#x27;t pleasant to work with.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality, very soft.</li>
            <li> The ferrules are beautiful but there are other full size</li>
            <li> I love them very soft brushes and easy to cary on as they are travel size ..</li>
            <li> Super soft and luxurious, and I love the leaf detailing!</li>
            <li> I thought these were a full make up brush set</li>
            <li> A lady in Walgreen was telling me about this brushes I had to try I love them for real</li>
            <li> You will find the bristles to be wonderfully pliable and not the least scratchy.</li>
            <li> For some reason I bought this set thinking that they were full sizes, but they&#x27;re travel size brushes.</li>
            <li> The full powder brush, largest one in the set, measures 1 and 1/8 of inch (3 cm) at the widest part of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made BIG brushes with the same cute design, but they good for traveling or my purse :)</li>
            <li> Yes, the handles are short and the heads aren&#x27;t very big at all, but that makes them absolutely perfect for throwing in my purse for touch-ups on the go.</li>
            <li> super brushes..</li>
            <li> quick shipping .  </li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth, they make my makeup application so much easier and my makeup looks more even and smooth.</li>
            <li> but they are very soft and work perfectly fine, would recommend if you are going to use it as a travel set!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the designs on the brush are very pretty</li>
            <li> But I do use it to apply a light dusting of my translucent eye shadow, and that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> They are super short and work a lot better as shadow application than foundation!</li>
            <li> they are very soft i love them</li>
            <li> Such cute packaging!</li>
            <li> Received package quickly than expected which is good</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes, I have no complaints plus for the price I am surprised with the good quality.</li>
            <li> Great little brushes.  </li>
            <li> These are cute and soft.</li>
            <li> wanted to use something more natural on my face.  </li>
            <li> The larger three of the five brushes are definitely not the ideal size for their intended purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, and are both well made and cute.  </li>
            <li> but so far i am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I only own Ecotools brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall nice though.</li>
            <li> They were a lot smaller than I expected but the quality of the brushes are superb.</li>
            <li> Honestly I got this kit just for the buffing concealer brush, but the other brushes are really nice and soft too.</li>
            <li> It makes me happy to see them and use them and they meet my purposes well enough, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, can not get things like this locally for anywhere near this price</li>
            <li> Okay, so these little brushes are pretty adorable.</li>
            <li> Also, the bonus is that the packaging they come in is actually a small hardcover &amp;#34;book&amp;#34; storage case, which makes this very handy for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Great little brushes!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools however, I recently purchased this set from Target.  </li>
            <li> they are SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li> The purple one will probably sit unused and I&#x27;m sure I could find a use for the blue one, but it&#x27;s not likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave this three stars because they seem well made, and of course the pretty ferrules that prompted me to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I think they would have done better making a fancy version of their essential eye set.</li>
            <li> they are small and great for travel brushes are made very well</li>
            <li> Love this company and my second time buying a brush set from them.</li>
            <li> They would make for better travel brushes because the travel brushes (eye brush set) they do have are even smaller than these.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to a seasoned makeup user.</li>
            <li> I was at my local superstore and noticed this set sitting out by itself and couldn&#x27;t find any more of them</li>
            <li> so I am really glad I got the last one.</li>
            <li> Gave these to my granddaughter for xmas, she likes them very much and very pretty colors on the handles, brush&#x27;s are very soft..</li>
            <li> A very cute little travel kit.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and these feel very gentle on my face and don&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> She said these are good for traveling since they&#x27;re small.</li>
            <li> Very soft after first use and does the job!</li>
            <li> The little designs are so cute!</li>
            <li> With the smaller handles, it&#x27;s easy to blend the concealer</li>
            <li> no one&#x27;s face is that small lol except my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li> Love these because they’re small and fit in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools, and as always, these brushes were soft and cute; however, they were just too small</li>
            <li> Overall nice looking soft brushes, I would recommend if looking into a new mini-travel brushes.</li>
            <li> nice little brush set</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find a really good face brush like that Sephora one.</li>
            <li> Although they still have the great quality of Ecotools, they need to be broken in a bit before they really pick up product well.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really like them they have held up well and do not lose bristles.</li>
            <li> foundation brush blends product real well.</li>
            <li> Very petite, though.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would specify the size here.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like them, and</li>
            <li> it blends concealer with absorbing it.</li>
            <li> They are well-made, don&#x27;t seem to be shedding, and blend my cosmetics very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes were a gift, recipient says they are just as good as more expensive brands she has tried!  </li>
            <li> Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> A little too small but the quality is awesome!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although most of the brushes are small for their intended purposes, and even a little small for the purposes I&#x27;ve found for them, they work okay and are definitely great for on-the-go touch ups where you don&#x27;t want to lug full-sized brushes around.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some fun, pretty brushes for touch-up purposes these are definitely for you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> Great soft brushes I thought they would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> However, even though they are small and travel-sized, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is the pretty design on each handle...a classy touch.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awesome and small enough to fit in the same bag with the other set</li>
            <li> brushes looked nice smaller than i expected it to be</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are small but it was exactly what I was looking for &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I was planning on buying some for my Mom and Sister for their Birthday, but they already ran out on Ecotools main website</li>
            <li> The product feels very soft n gentle against your skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I would still highly recommend buying any Eco Tools brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the tiny flat top brush</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a professional set that is well made and smartly designed.</li>
            <li> also love that these brushes come in a little book, per say.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a set of long handled, full sized brushes, this is not the set for you.  </li>
            <li> They are tiny, but I kind of like that since it&#x27;s what kept the cost down</li>
            <li> these brushes are very soft and high quality.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting brushes that are professional quality for applying and buffing your foundation every morning, you may want to go elsewhere and splurge on something a little more practical.</li>
            <li> but when I got it the box isnt even new</li>
            <li> It comes as it shows and for those who are new to using brushes they have descriptions on how to use them and why.</li>
            <li> I needed new travel brushes and was hoping these would work for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if that buffing brush was sold on its own, I would buy 5.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes!</li>
            <li> (I love Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer) and dust on a little finishing powder and my dark circles are erased without emphasizing fine lines or getting that weird too bright undereye circle.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves make-up and these brushes are so soft and well made for the money!</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools brushes &amp; this set is extremely small.</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes, they&#x27;re soft and fairly good quality the only down side to thus set is that they are very small!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are really pretty but super small.</li>
            <li> The powder brush doesn&#x27;t distribute the right amount of pressed or loose powder , foundation brush makes my foundation streak  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the brushes do the job, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> its soft</li>
            <li> I wish that they came in a soft case rather in this box</li>
            <li> They are soft and not harsh to your face when using.</li>
            <li> The concealer brush and powder brush are my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> Really they deserve one or two for being such an impractical set.</li>
            <li> and they are not so soft as my Charm Pro Kabuki.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, they hold product well...</li>
            <li> This is a good travel kit, I returned them, sorry just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super silky soft, think are actually very comparable in terms of quality to a set I paid $60 for at a major beauty store a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The usage guide inside the inner cover is also very handy for beginners or for anyone who wants to know which brushes were designed to do what (though one can use the brushes for cosmetics outside of the recommendations on the box without any ill effect, as I have).  </li>
            <li> I do like these brushes they are very soft little to no shedding the furils are very pretty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the flat or paddle type foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the EcoTools brushes, especially the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any brushed from EcoTools.</li>
            <li> They do the job and don&#x27;t shed (which is a plus) but I have to spend a HUGE amount of time with these as they only cover half inch at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two biggest and the smallest (pink, brown, and green) are the most practical.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are hard for me to do my eye makeup with because they are too long.</li>
            <li> What surprised me when I opened the box was how tiny the brushes are!!!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why I thought they were going to be full size.</li>
            <li> two pointed brushes are good for eye shadow but the flat one is a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> For overnight travel, though, I would need to add my large Eco-tools kabuki brush to the mix in order to apply my Bare Minerals loose powder foundation to my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the two largest sizes aren&#x27;t very useful sizes (too big for eye shadow, too small for anything else).  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, the foundation brush takes some work to get your whole face covered.</li>
            <li> These brushes are smaller than I expected but still get the job done and very well done at that.</li>
            <li> Emphasis on little - be aware that these are travel sized.</li>
            <li> brushes are really soft too,the texture feel plush and like some high end brushes I have used in the past and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like small brushes .</li>
            <li> brushes are small but work very well.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to fit in a small makeup bag.</li>
            <li> i cannot comment to the durability since I haven&#x27;t had them long enough</li>
            <li> The flat concealer brush, smallest one in the set, measures 3/8 of an inch (0.9 cm) in width at the widest part of the brush bristles.  </li>
            <li> Even though I read the reviews and saw them in store, when you use them they are still smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft but they are way too small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel guilty about investing in a few more for the long term.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than other brands</li>
            <li> The smallest one is actually no different than their other travel concealer brush, it&#x27;s just prettier.</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27;</li>
            <li> Be advised--these brushes are only a few inches long.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised how small and short these are.  </li>
            <li> I imagine the brushes a little bigger</li>
            <li> Other than that, you can only basically use the brushes for eyes and maybe contouring because they are too small for foundation or powder, maybe as travel size, but I like bigger brushes because it gets the work done faster.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these ,they were a little smaller than expected,but I ordered on the fly,and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I use as a travel touch up kit, they are two small for me to do an entire makeup look - it would take to long.</li>
            <li> Although, the hairs can be quite rough when they are shedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shorter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and cute design, but very very small. :(</li>
            <li> but the bigger brushes are too small for what they are intended to do.</li>
            <li> so the bristles don&#x27;t touch each other (OCD here)</li>
            <li> They are compact enough that I can put them in my small makeup bag.</li>
            <li> the only thing is they are small</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I thought, you have to work a lot longer to do your makeup with these because there so small compared to their other brush sets.</li>
            <li> But they are too small, my travel size brushes are larger then these.</li>
            <li> Love brushes, hate handles.</li>
            <li> I use the brown brush (second largest) for buffing out uneven areas of my foundation or applying touch ups to small areas, and I use the largest brush (pink) for blush and contouring even though it&#x27;s on the small side for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could see the pink one working for blush (although it&#x27;s a bit small for that) and the brown one would work well for blending.</li>
            <li> flat buffer brush was a little squished when I received it making it difficult to actually use as a buffer</li>
            <li> I know others are complaining about how small the brushes are, but as I am extremely nearsighted</li>
            <li> I was a little disapointed in the size.</li>
            <li> you can find theses cheaper at cvs or Walmart a little over price here</li>
            <li> I have already been aware of how small they are, so I won&#x27;t as disappointed as other reviews.</li>
            <li> Really small travel sized.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they were gunna be so small, even after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> So I did read the reviews before purchasing and saw all of the comments about how small these brushes were,</li>
            <li> They are literally as small as everyone is stating.</li>
            <li> Small in size</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the brushes to be so small .</li>
            <li> i knew they were so small</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure it works well for anything but applying eye</li>
            <li> but at first i was disappointed</li>
            <li> but, the brushes are so small.  </li>
            <li> As everyone else has already stated, these are small brushes.</li>
            <li> i have small hands</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;&#x27;t have bought them if I had known how small they are.</li>
            <li> I have small hands a skinny fingers.</li>
            <li> I haven’t had any problems with excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re soooo small.</li>
            <li> These brushes are quite small even though I purchased them as a travel set.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is way too small for its intended purpose (it would take about 10 minutes to apply foundation with it)</li>
            <li> These brushes are small- even though I bought them in a store and saw them in person before I bought them, it was still hard to realize quite how small they were before I took them out of the package and started to use them.</li>
            <li> I am not saying all Eco Tools brushes are bad, because I only tested this set, and it is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hard to cough up $28 per brush.</li>
            <li> SMALL!</li>
            <li> Very small and not usable at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why make up brushes are so crazy expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they tried to come up with something new, they really failed this time.</li>
            <li> a bit small!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like that the bristles are so thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost false advertising.</li>
            <li> They also had a slight smell but not too bad.</li>
            <li> They can be used for other purpose but if you buy them for what it says in the product description, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this set.</li>
            <li> Why should the cosmetic brush be a boring necessity?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT brushes. I want to expand my selections and get different styles of brushes! These work just as good as the Sephora brand and it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find a really good face brush like that Sephora one. It&#x27;s just hard to cough up $28 per brush. I highly recommend the EcoTools brushes, especially the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Small but perfect for my makeup and my purse.</li>
            <li> Great little brushes.  Emphasis on little - be aware that these are travel sized.</li>
            <li> Really small travel sized. I didn&#x27;t think they were gunna be so small, even after reading the reviews. Guess it&#x27;s ny fault.</li>
            <li> They look very nice, are good quality brushes,0 but the bigger brushes are too small for what they are intended to do. They can be used for other purpose but if you buy them for what it says in the product description, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Okay, so these little brushes are pretty adorable. Yes, the handles are short and the heads aren&#x27;t very big at all, but that makes them absolutely perfect for throwing in my purse for touch-ups on the go. If you&#x27;re expecting brushes that are professional quality for applying and buffing your foundation every morning, you may want to go elsewhere and splurge on something a little more practical. But if you just want some cute travel brushes, these are a beautiful option.</li>
            <li> A little too small but the quality is awesome! Really nice airbush finish!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast! I got it next day. Very soft brushes, I have no complaints plus for the price I am surprised with the good quality. The reviews say they are small, but I think they are perfect size. Easy to hold and use. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> super brushes.. I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> So I did read the reviews before purchasing and saw all of the comments about how small these brushes were, I assumed they were probably travel size. They are literally as small as everyone is stating. They are very soft and cute design, but very very small. :(</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! This is the only brand I use now. They are good quality and good price, rarely do I get one that sheds. These sizes are perfect for my make up desk.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Target. They are tiny, but I kind of like that since it&#x27;s what kept the cost down haha. I really don&#x27;t understand why make up brushes are so crazy expensive! Anyway, the brushes do the job, the bristles are soft. They are labeled and come in a box type thing with a flapping lid and each brush has it&#x27;s own spot. I like to keep them in there so the bristles don&#x27;t touch each other (OCD here) I use the foundation brush the most.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Small in size but they do what they&#x27;re meant to do! Great for travel!</li>
            <li> i wish I knew this before but these are like baby-brushes. They do the job and don&#x27;t shed (which is a plus) but I have to spend a HUGE amount of time with these as they only cover half inch at a time. Good for travel I guess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the brushes to be so small . i really don&#x27;t like small brushes . i prefer regular size brushes.&lt;br /&gt;if i knew they were so small i would never would have order them</li>
            <li> My daughter loves make-up and these brushes are so soft and well made for the money! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this set. I am not sure why I thought they were going to be full size. Very small and not usable at all. I would skip this and not purchase.</li>
            <li> Great variety of sizes &amp; types -  good value</li>
            <li> I love ecotools. I&#x27;ve never purchased anything from them that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I thought they would be but they are not mini. They are big enough to use on a daily basis as regular brushes but I prefer to use them as touch up brushes because of the length of the handles.&lt;br /&gt;The flat buffer brush was a little squished when I received it making it difficult to actually use as a buffer brush.&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush is great because you can use it for a flawless application of either blush or powder foundation. It applies perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The small buffer brush is perfect for concealer either powder or cream. With the smaller handles, it&#x27;s easy to blend the concealer perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I found that cream products do not stick in the bristles once these brushes are washed.&lt;br /&gt;The two pointed brushes are good for eye shadow but the flat one is a little hard to get used to. I am not entirely sure it works well for anything but applying eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;I think the colorful metal on the handles where the brush meets the wood, is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that these brushes come in a little book, per say. That makes it easy to gift them or take them on the go.</li>
            <li> These are cute and soft. They are smaller than regular brushes but still get the job done.!</li>
            <li> This brand is one of my favorites. Love brushes, hate handles. Way too short! This is a good travel kit, I returned them, sorry just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I imagine the brushes a little bigger but they are perfect i can take them with me&lt;br /&gt;the designs on the brush are very pretty they are very soft i love them</li>
            <li> WARNING: These are very short handled travel sized brushes. So, if you are looking for a set of long handled, full sized brushes, this is not the set for you.  However, even though they are small and travel-sized, they are amazing. The brush heads are full and soft, apply your cream, liquid &amp; powder cosmetics easily and evenly, and clean up nicely, while retaining their shapes.  Also, the bonus is that the packaging they come in is actually a small hardcover &amp;#34;book&amp;#34; storage case, which makes this very handy for traveling.  The usage guide inside the inner cover is also very handy for beginners or for anyone who wants to know which brushes were designed to do what (though one can use the brushes for cosmetics outside of the recommendations on the box without any ill effect, as I have).  A very thoughtful stocking stuffer for a makeup person. I know I keep mine in my purse and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I thought these were a full make up brush set but at first i was disappointed but then i fell in love with them. Great quality and very soft to the face.</li>
            <li> a bit small!! but they are very soft and work perfectly fine, would recommend if you are going to use it as a travel set!</li>
            <li> Very soft after first use and does the job! Although, the hairs can be quite rough when they are shedding.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, THESE ARE MINI BRUSHES. Travel-size, even.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  They are great quality.  They don&#x27;t shed bristles.  They are very soft and work great.</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools however, I recently purchased this set from Target.  I read the reviews and ignored them thinking that everyone else was exaggerating but, the brushes are so small.  They could be good as travel brushes but, I would not purchase them for that price.</li>
            <li> sometimes it is better to spend good money in one brush than try to purchase more for less. The brushes are a very important part of your make up. You don&#x27;t need a lot, but you need good ones. I am not saying all Eco Tools brushes are bad, because I only tested this set, and it is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Eco Tools are the best makeup brushes I have ever used! The bristles are extremely soft and apply makeup perfectly. You also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Brushes were a gift, recipient says they are just as good as more expensive brands she has tried!  Great news!</li>
            <li> Received package quickly than expected which is good but when I got it the box isnt even new... somewhat good condition.. brushes are used... had glitter and foundation on them...brushes looked nice smaller than i expected it to be</li>
            <li> very light weight and full coverage. compact and easy to fit into your make up bag and tote along in your purse for a night on the town</li>
            <li> As everyone else has already stated, these are small brushes. I find that they&#x27;re perfect for contouring/highlighting though. I wouldn&#x27;t use these for allover application, but they&#x27;re good brushes nonetheless.</li>
            <li> handle is way too short!</li>
            <li> cute compact brushes love the colors.  wanted to use something more natural on my face.  quick shipping .  really like them they have held up well and do not lose bristles.</li>
            <li> excellent product. foundation brush blends product real well. leaves no streaks. brushes are small but work very well. i have small hands</li>
            <li> These brushes are small- even though I bought them in a store and saw them in person before I bought them, it was still hard to realize quite how small they were before I took them out of the package and started to use them. The larger three of the five brushes are definitely not the ideal size for their intended purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I definitely found uses for all of the brushes. The smallest two brushes, intended for concealer, do indeed work well for concealer so that&#x27;s great. The foundation brush, the purple one, I would never dream of attempting to use for foundation because it&#x27;s just tiny. But I do use it to apply a light dusting of my translucent eye shadow, and that works pretty well. I use the brown brush (second largest) for buffing out uneven areas of my foundation or applying touch ups to small areas, and I use the largest brush (pink) for blush and contouring even though it&#x27;s on the small side for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although most of the brushes are small for their intended purposes, and even a little small for the purposes I&#x27;ve found for them, they work okay and are definitely great for on-the-go touch ups where you don&#x27;t want to lug full-sized brushes around. For overnight travel, though, I would need to add my large Eco-tools kabuki brush to the mix in order to apply my Bare Minerals loose powder foundation to my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are SO PRETTY. Let&#x27;s be honest, that&#x27;s the biggest reason why I just couldn&#x27;t resist buying them! It makes me happy to see them and use them and they meet my purposes well enough, especially for the price. I have some Eco-tools brushes that I&#x27;ve been using for over five years now and they are still going strong, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about investing in a few more for the long term. If you&#x27;re looking for some fun, pretty brushes for touch-up purposes these are definitely for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my daughter since she asked for it. The shipping was very quick. My daughter loves it. She said these are good for traveling since they&#x27;re small.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cute, small, and blend wonderfully. They are compact enough that I can put them in my small makeup bag. They are perfect for contouring on the go.</li>
            <li> A lady in Walgreen was telling me about this brushes I had to try I love them for real its soft</li>
            <li> These brushes are a bit shorter than I pictured but they&#x27;re great! Very soft and smooth, they make my makeup application so much easier and my makeup looks more even and smooth. I have super sensitive skin and these feel very gentle on my face and don&#x27;t irritate me at all. They&#x27;re also very easy to clean because they&#x27;re compact. Very happy I purchased!</li>
            <li> I think these brushes have some of the best value out there. This is a great set, great quality and look nice too.</li>
            <li> The product I received looked a lot different from this and was not the same pattern/ or even product.</li>
            <li> These and my Sigma brushes make my makeup applications perfection and a pleasure!</li>
            <li> So nice I thought they were real &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; brushes. Bought them for my daughter who loves the too!!</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools brushes &amp; this set is extremely small. Even though I read the reviews and saw them in store, when you use them they are still smaller than expected. Although they still have the great quality of Ecotools, they need to be broken in a bit before they really pick up product well. I recommend for detail work or travel touch up. I use as a travel touch up kit, they are two small for me to do an entire makeup look - it would take to long. This set will not be for everyone, if you don&#x27;t need or want tiny brushes, don&#x27;t need a travel touch up set or a detail brush set I would say look elsewhere. The ferrules are beautiful but there are other full size Ecotools brushes that work as well and cover more surface area if that is what you need.</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes, they&#x27;re soft and fairly good quality the only down side to thus set is that they are very small!! They also had a slight smell but not too bad. These would be great if the foundation &amp; powder brushes were larger.... no one&#x27;s face is that small lol except my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft but they are way too small. Wouldn&#x27;&#x27;t have bought them if I had known how small they are. Just travel size?</li>
            <li> Why should the cosmetic brush be a boring necessity? This set is nicely boxed and nestled in convenient storage to lessen drawer or travel bag real estate. I liked the explanation for the use and application of each brush printed inside the lid. You will find the bristles to be wonderfully pliable and not the least scratchy. An added bonus is the pretty design on each handle...a classy touch. For the money, this is a professional set that is well made and smartly designed.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised how small and short these are.  Truly &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; brushes.  The short handles aren&#x27;t pleasant to work with.  and the two largest sizes aren&#x27;t very useful sizes (too big for eye shadow, too small for anything else).  Only the smallest three are usable sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, and are both well made and cute.  Very petite, though.</li>
            <li> nice little brush set</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of reviews complaining about the size. These are perfect for me beacuse I have small hands a skinny fingers. Most brushes are hard for me to do my eye makeup with because they are too long. The smaller brushes work great for doing eyeshadow and under eye concealer. The bigger ones are really great for applying bronzer and contouring my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are really soft too,the texture feel plush and like some high end brushes I have used in the past and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love them very soft brushes and easy to cary on as they are travel size .. I wish that they came in a soft case rather in this box</li>
            <li> Shorter than I expected.  Still work okay.</li>
            <li> Such cute packaging! when these brushes arrived I was expecting them to ne bigger than they are, however they are still absolutely brilliant. The first thing I noticed was how soft they are, they make applying face make up so easy and flawless. They do have quite a strong noticeable scent to them, but I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve washed them a couple more times that will begin to fade. These are very convenient for travel and everyday use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools, and as always, these brushes were soft and cute; however, they were just too small, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what to use them for, so I just gave them away.</li>
            <li> Love these because they’re small and fit in my travel makeup bag. EcoTools always has quality brushes. I haven’t had any problems with excessive shedding. The fun colors are just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Great soft brushes I thought they would be a little bigger but there fine</li>
            <li> these brushes are very soft and high quality.  i cannot comment to the durability since I haven&#x27;t had them long enough but so far i am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are just the right size. Much smaller than other brands but you will get used to it. I only own Ecotools brushes. It comes as it shows and for those who are new to using brushes they have descriptions on how to use them and why. They are even labeled which brush is which on the handle. They are soft and not harsh to your face when using. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really pretty but super small. The only brush I get any use out of is the concealer buff brush.</li>
            <li> SMALL! Omgosh, had I known how tiny these brushes are I would&#x27;ve skipped them. I really wish they would specify the size here. It&#x27;s almost false advertising. Will not be returning because I don&#x27;t want to go through the return hassle. :/</li>
            <li> Great brushes as Eco Tools always is however if you are looking for full size brushes I suggest you try a different set from Eco Tools. They are a travel size but I would still highly recommend buying any Eco Tools brushes. Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> These are great tools for making your beauty routine a ritual. Super soft and luxurious, and I love the leaf detailing!</li>
            <li> For some reason I bought this set thinking that they were full sizes, but they&#x27;re travel size brushes. Make sure you clean them before using because it broke me out when I tried it without washing it. I like the tiny flat top brush and I use that for doing smokey eye looks. Other than that, you can only basically use the brushes for eyes and maybe contouring because they are too small for foundation or powder, maybe as travel size, but I like bigger brushes because it gets the work done faster. They dont shed and the price is ok for the set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Ecotools brushes for their excellent quality.  The brushes in this set are no exception.  The bristles are dense, very soft and feel good to the touch.  What surprised me when I opened the box was how tiny the brushes are!!!  From top of the bristles to the bottom of the handle, each brush measures 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) in length.  The flat concealer brush, smallest one in the set, measures 3/8 of an inch (0.9 cm) in width at the widest part of the brush bristles.  The full powder brush, largest one in the set, measures 1 and 1/8 of inch (3 cm) at the widest part of the bristles.  These brushes will probably work well for detail makeup applications or as travel brushes...  If I have known about the brush sizes beforehand, however, I would not have ordered this set.</li>
            <li> A very cute little travel kit.  Be advised--these brushes are only a few inches long.  That being said, they work perfectly for travel, are study, and nicely designed.  Purchased one for myself and one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Great for contouring eye shadow, cover up face make up. The product feels very soft n gentle against your skin.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect to go kit!!&lt;br /&gt;I use these a lot and over all great quality and beautiful coloring.</li>
            <li> Honestly I got this kit just for the buffing concealer brush, but the other brushes are really nice and soft too. The concealer brush and powder brush are my favorites so far. I can stipple and blend concealer under my eyes (I love Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer) and dust on a little finishing powder and my dark circles are erased without emphasizing fine lines or getting that weird too bright undereye circle. The powder brush does a great job picking up product and blending it in. I don&#x27;t really use the flat or paddle type foundation brushes. The buffing brush seems like it will do a nice job. Very happy with my purchase. I know others are complaining about how small the brushes are, but as I am extremely nearsighted I actually like shorter handles so I can get close to the mirror and see what I&#x27;m doing, lol.</li>
            <li> I needed new travel brushes and was hoping these would work for me. I really wanted to like them, and I do- but they&#x27;re soooo small. It&#x27;s not just the handles, but the brush heads as well and that&#x27;s the part that counts. They&#x27;re very pretty and the bristles are the amazing quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Ecotools, but it&#x27;s not their best set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two biggest and the smallest (pink, brown, and green) are the most practical. I could see the pink one working for blush (although it&#x27;s a bit small for that) and the brown one would work well for blending. The smallest one is actually no different than their other travel concealer brush, it&#x27;s just prettier. The purple one will probably sit unused and I&#x27;m sure I could find a use for the blue one, but it&#x27;s not likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this three stars because they seem well made, and of course the pretty ferrules that prompted me to purchase them. Really they deserve one or two for being such an impractical set. I think they would have done better making a fancy version of their essential eye set. It&#x27;s too bad they tried to come up with something new, they really failed this time.</li>
            <li> Definitely a travel sized brush set lol! They are super short and work a lot better as shadow application than foundation!</li>
            <li> they work really nice. love them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, but be prepared, the handles are shorter than you think.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes.  Highly recommend any brushed from EcoTools.</li>
            <li> Perfect for conturing and concealer. I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, the foundation brush takes some work to get your whole face covered. The blemish brush works well, so does the blush brush. Nice quality, very soft. Considering getting a different ecotool brush for foundation. Overall nice though.</li>
            <li> Sooooooo cute! Very soft and pretty. Bought them at a good price. I have already been aware of how small they are, so I won&#x27;t as disappointed as other reviews. If you are okay with the size, just buy it!</li>
            <li> Perfectttttt! Great quality, soft.&lt;br /&gt;They are small but it was exactly what I was looking for &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> perfect little set with the softest bristles to ever touch your face.  As always ecotools brushes are well made and work beautifully.</li>
            <li> Get these while you still can!  They&#x27;re awesome and small enough to fit in the same bag with the other set I purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EcoTools BAMBOO 6-pc Makeup Brush Set 1206</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, can not get things like this locally for anywhere near this price</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes.  They do not shed and applies your makeup flawlessly. Compact, which makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this set. The powder brush doesn&#x27;t distribute the right amount of pressed or loose powder , foundation brush makes my foundation streak  and they are not so soft as my Charm Pro Kabuki. I also didn&#x27;t like that the bristles are so thin.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes they are small and great for travel brushes are made very well</li>
            <li> They were a lot smaller than I expected but the quality of the brushes are superb.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the brushes I just thought they would be a bit bigger!!! Over all okay I guess</li>
            <li> These brushes are quite small even though I purchased them as a travel set. Because of the size not all of the brushes work for their described purpose. Still they are excellent quality and I have found uses for them all. The two concealer brushes work as described (though I prefer to use the smaller one as an eye shadow crease brush) and the buffing concealer brush is particularly excellent- it blends concealer with absorbing it. The foundation brush is way too small for its intended purpose (it would take about 10 minutes to apply foundation with it) so I use it as another concealer brush. While the powder brush does work for powder, it is more appropriate as a blush brush. The stand out of this kit is the foundation buffing brush, it is actually the best I&#x27;ve ever tried for applying and blending foundation. Seriously, if that buffing brush was sold on its own, I would buy 5.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and because they were so cheap I was not expecting to. I am happy to say that I was wrong. great quality, even better price!</li>
            <li> Love this company and my second time buying a brush set from them. Like the unique design</li>
            <li> Great little brushes!!</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes! They are small enough to fit in a small makeup bag. I used them every day with my regular size brushes, and then take them with me, when I am on the go! They are great for doing touch ups throughout the day. The brushes are good quality and soft. Excellent price and great product! I totally recommend these for any beauty diva.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Easy to use, easy to clean. Perfect size.</li>
            <li> I do like these brushes they are very soft little to no shedding the furils are very pretty the only thing is they are small the handles are short and the heads are short. They are much smaller than I thought, you have to work a lot longer to do your makeup with these because there so small compared to their other brush sets. I was a little disapointed in the size. They would make for better travel brushes because the travel brushes (eye brush set) they do have are even smaller than these. Overall nice looking soft brushes, I would recommend if looking into a new mini-travel brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very lovely, the design is chic and with all ecotools products they are very good quality. Soft bristles, they hold product well... But they are TINY! If these brushes would have been full size, they would have been a five star for sure... But they are too small, my travel size brushes are larger then these. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to a seasoned makeup user.</li>
            <li> Love theses brushes they don&#x27;t shred at all easy to put On makeup and easy to clean you can find theses cheaper at cvs or Walmart a little over price here</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I was at my local superstore and noticed this set sitting out by itself and couldn&#x27;t find any more of them so I am really glad I got the last one. These brushes are super silky soft, think are actually very comparable in terms of quality to a set I paid $60 for at a major beauty store a few years ago. They are well-made, don&#x27;t seem to be shedding, and blend my cosmetics very well. So glad I found this set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are smaller than I expected but still get the job done and very well done at that.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!! Feel and work like the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I thought these brushes looked like a great set - and they would be if they weren&#x27;t miniature! They are travel size, although they are not advertised this way.  That would be fine, if it weren&#x27;t for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Handles too short.</li>
            <li> Nice set.  Really nice brushes.  Great travel sizes</li>
            <li> Gave these to my granddaughter for xmas, she likes them very much and very pretty colors on the handles, brush&#x27;s are very soft.. Nice set Good Price!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these ,they were a little smaller than expected,but I ordered on the fly,and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The little designs are so cute! I wish they weren&#x27;t &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27; I was planning on buying some for my Mom and Sister for their Birthday, but they already ran out on Ecotools main website and I got them for a pretty good price on their website. I wish they made BIG brushes with the same cute design, but they good for traveling or my purse :)</li>
            <li> The brushes serve there purpose, Haven&#x27;t had any fall out while cleaning them. Image is deceiving though they are ALOT smaller in person! they should put mini brush set somewhere in the description!</li>
