            <li>As advertised, original manufacturer product.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Lathers easy and smellls really nice, especially in the morning when you need help waking up.</li>
            <li>Removes impurities, and gently removes buildup from other products; smells great.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner because it leaves my hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It probably works better for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s hydrating my hair any more than my other shampoos and on top of that, my hair gets oily and dirty looking 5-6 hours after washing with it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this shampoo after reading all the great reviews, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> I SWITCH OFF BETWEEN THE PUREOLOGY HYDRATE SHAMPOO AND PUREOLOGY PURE VOLUME SHAMPOO AS I HAVE RECENTLY STARTED CHEMOTHERAPY AND MY HAIR HAS ALREADY CHANGED IN TEXTURE. THIS SEEMS TO WORK FOR ME. I HAVE USED PUREOLOGY PRODUCTS FOR A LONG TIME.</li>

            <li> Love Pureology.  It is the best shampoo for my fizzy, curly (though I straighten it), blonde, shoulder length hair.  Pureology makes my mane manageable.</li>

            <li> Very happy with my product. Thank you</li>
