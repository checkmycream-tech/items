            <li>a fair shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for an outstanding probiotic with</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Since taking these probiotics I have never felt better!</li>
            <li>Two hours after taking it,  if you keep your feet warm,  then you can expect to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the ever popular Three Lac and Five Lac and they seemed to not do anything for</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Fine product good price</li>
            <li>Great but very costly!!</li>
            <li>Best probiotic I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, they are the best on the market.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best probiotic on the market.  </li>
            <li>but I feel it is more effective taken this</li>
            <li>I have tried others and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the BEST Probiotic on the market today.</li>
            <li>Simply the best probiotic on the planet everyone should use it.</li>
            <li>I have used most on the market, this was recommended by Lyme/Bartonella specialist.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad it works for so many people and send well wishes to everyone in the company</li>
            <li>I love it and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The package had a March 2014 date and I received it in September/ October, having better results with VSL#3 (112.5 billion per capsule)</li>
            <li>Use them daily and they work great!  </li>
            <li>I take this probiotic twice daily with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I don&#x27;t understand why that would make it better.  </li>
            <li>It works MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I feel more at eased.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>These are easier to take than most probiotics that need to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li>However, I agree with another reviewer, that if you take this with a meal it will act more like a digestive enzyme.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price if you need a good quality probiotic.</li>
            <li>I love these probiotics.</li>
            <li>I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li>I tried many inferior pro biotic , then I found Dr. Ohhiras and I have been sold on it for two years now.</li>
            <li>i seem to have an allergic reaction to many probiotics but not this one.</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to get it</li>
            <li>Need to order more, works well.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use as directed.</li>
            <li>and I feel better.</li>
            <li>However, it can upset stomach with people with GERD and acid reflux because it has more than just the lactobacillus component.</li>
            <li>The Kampuku soap showed an immediate improvement and thus we were quite pleased with that product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
            <li>I took a chance when ordering the Pro Formula probiotics from Amazon and was pleased to see an expiration date of well in to 2015.  </li>
            <li>Prompt service and feel better on them.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s more aggressive in colonizing the gut.</li>
            <li>easy to take, seems to be good so far so good.  </li>
            <li>We have found these probiotics to be the most quickly balancing, effective and enduring in our bodies.</li>
            <li>When I took them for a whole week, life was good :)</li>
            <li>Stomach a lot more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li>Take on an empty stomach for best results.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like this was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great price and got here super fast.</li>
            <li>We love this product and the original one.</li>
            <li>I love that Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics, both Original and Pro formulas, don&#x27;t require refrigeration.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Ohhira has many different probiotics and all of them are great.</li>
            <li>An easy product to personalize.</li>
            <li>However &amp;#34;Professional Formula&amp;#34; may be too strong for some people&#x27;s digestive systems and they may want to try a milder version.</li>
            <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t bc of this type of probiotic because i&#x27;ve taken it before and was completely fine.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in my digestion.  </li>
            <li>I do believe that gut health is important though, so, for now, these are my probiotics of choice.</li>
            <li>(I believe Align is not dairy free).  </li>
            <li>so  important to keep the &amp;#34;good guys&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>Started with the original formula , which was helpful as well as the soap.  </li>
            <li>This probiotic is recommended far and wide as the best and most reliable.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an increase of more than 10 whole bucks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the top-dollar for me!  </li>
            <li>Amazon usually has the best prices too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would not be without it and definately worth the price!</li>
            <li>A fantastic product, and the best probiotic I&#x27;ve tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other brands, all refrigerated and claiming to be potent).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t verify if any of it is true</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason so many people, including me, pay so much for Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics.  </li>
            <li>He is still breast feeding at present which may also be a cause for the good results.</li>
            <li>This newer formula by Dr. Ohhira includes more types of bacteria than the original formula, and I found it actually works better for me.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I am now 19 weeks pregnant and continue to take them at night.</li>
            <li>It took her almost one more week to return to normal.  </li>
            <li>Gas and bloating so much better and eczema on abdomen is gone, and dry winter skin is much better.  </li>
            <li>It is also great that they are few that do not have to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with Dr. Ohira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula capsules.</li>
            <li>Entirely worth the money.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey , but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also, customer service has been good, with emails from company asking if everything was ok, and offering help if I had any problems or questions, so they have taken customer reviews seriously, which is encouraging.</li>
            <li>Received the shipment right on time.  </li>
            <li>This special formula has the strains that really work.</li>
            <li>It took about a week to notice the full affect; functions are running much smoother now.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple different brands, and I am so happy my doctor recommended this brand.</li>
            <li>I tried the regular and found personally I do better with the pro, and it&#x27;s worth the premium.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of hype about this product - about how its made and the quality of the probiotic bacterial cultures and how they help you maintain essential healthy body bacterial health and get rid of candida etc.</li>
            <li>Helps me with stomach/intestine issues and really bolsters immune system!</li>
            <li>I just assumed it would be higher strength</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey but does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different probiotics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because after all, despite being done with the loading phase, and currently taking more than the recommended follow up doses of 2-4 capsules a day</li>
            <li>Because I rotate probiotics as each  has various benefits, and the research and track record of Dr. O. is outstanding, I really  like to keep this in my  &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; of preventative measures as the immune system starts in the &amp;#34; gut&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>It simply keeps you healthy.</li>
            <li>I probably get on my &amp;#34;soap box&amp;#34; more about probiotics than any other preventative procedure and find it a confimation of their value as even now Phillips has a product on the market, you know for sure  when Big Pharm hops on the band wagon, they have &amp;#34;seen the light&amp;#34; (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been taking these for a  few years, and I feel better!</li>
            <li>After having long term antibiotic use kill off much of the good bacteria in my gut, this is the only product i have found that helps to restore the balance.</li>
            <li>About a year or so ago, I noticed two things; (1) the softgel capsule was not soft any more; rather, it was a hard, or more accurately crispy gel capsule; (2) it wasn&#x27;t working like it used to-</li>
            <li>, I believe radiation there is still very high  -</li>
            <li>A little bit pricey, but this product actually works, and is great for sensitives stomaches.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been able to function better without having the constant heartburn pain when I was doing something that involved a little strenuousness.</li>
            <li>These probiotics work really fast to restore intestinal health after intense stress or antibiotics.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>After careful review of all the probiotics on the market, I found this to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have had chronic inflammation in my stomach and this really has worked&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>If you are having bloating issues, you really should give it a try.</li>
            <li>My husband has IBS and these really help.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you research them and see if they work for you!</li>
            <li>Instead, they give out other products like Align, which may help for some, but contain fillers and excipients that aggravate many people</li>
            <li>Just eat less than two weeks, there should be a better long-term effects of eating.</li>
            <li>I did write the main Ohhira company about it and of course, no word.....</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever left a review for anything I&#x27;ve bought online and the first reason is that I want to gripe about the exorbitant and unreasonable increase in prices!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the higher price, but would recommend the professional formula over the regular formula.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Been buying these for years and highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great probiotic, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This probiotic was highly recommended to me by my chiropractor.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For the past 3 years I occasionally try something different that&#x27;s cheaper with a lot of good reviews but nothing holds a candle to these probiotics!</li>
            <li>Since eating the probiotic, stool began to feel normal.</li>
            <li>Better than eating yoghurt all the time, which I can&#x27;t stomach after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>I also feel more energy everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>They also go down easily and contain lots of food ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I feel more energized and no more stomach issues.  </li>
            <li>Some have helped but these are the only ones that have worked consistently for me.</li>
            <li>I just began using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>In fine it has been a waste of money and of energies, my gas, spasms and intestinal motility is the same as it was before taking this bogus yet very well marketed product.</li>
            <li>This product is high quality and does exactly what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li>I have since gone on to the Professional Formula.</li>
            <li>I have been taking Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Professional Formula for over 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>switched to the Professional Formula</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Ohhira for your terrific product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking the original formula and then bumped up to the Professional Formula after a few boxes.</li>
            <li>The fermented contents and particular probiotics in Dr Ohhira&#x27;s have definitely helped my IBS-C.  </li>
            <li>We started with a high dose for the first few days and are now maintaining.  </li>
            <li>well i just wanted it for IBS related problems and after going thru a whole box I still am in the same point where I started it:</li>
            <li>which hence makes even lesser sense for me to shell out so much money for something that could possibly harm my body even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel as much relief as I expected since this is the Professional Formula.</li>
            <li>I started with the regular probiotic, which worked o.k., then switched to the Professional probiotic.  </li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to the professional version when I found out</li>
            <li>, I have still given it 3 stars and not the 2 stars that I originally thought of giving as, at least, it did not cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Work so very very well and regulate your body to once again work as it did before gluten began to destroy your intestine.</li>
            <li>The capsules are small and easy to swallow; should be taken twice a day on an empty stomach.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really know if taking them has any different effect on me than any other probiotic.</li>
            <li>After a few days on the Probiotics Professional Formula, I was able to go back to my exercise regimen with kettlebells with only a few minor issues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Years ago my acupuncturist had me take large doses of the &#x27;non-professional&#x27; (green box) version after taking Cipro.</li>

            <li> stuff good but overpriced</li>
            <li> a fair shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for an outstanding probiotic with</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Since taking these probiotics I have never felt better!</li>
            <li> Two hours after taking it,  if you keep your feet warm,  then you can expect to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the ever popular Three Lac and Five Lac and they seemed to not do anything for</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Fine product good price</li>
            <li> Great but very costly!!</li>
            <li> Best probiotic I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, they are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best probiotic on the market.  </li>
            <li> but I feel it is more effective taken this</li>
            <li> I have tried others and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the BEST Probiotic on the market today.</li>
            <li> Simply the best probiotic on the planet everyone should use it.</li>
            <li> I have used most on the market, this was recommended by Lyme/Bartonella specialist.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad it works for so many people and send well wishes to everyone in the company</li>
            <li> I love it and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The package had a March 2014 date and I received it in September/ October, having better results with VSL#3 (112.5 billion per capsule)</li>
            <li> Use them daily and they work great!  </li>
            <li> I take this probiotic twice daily with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> but I guess I don&#x27;t understand why that would make it better.  </li>
            <li> It works MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I feel more at eased.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> These are easier to take than most probiotics that need to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li> However, I agree with another reviewer, that if you take this with a meal it will act more like a digestive enzyme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price if you need a good quality probiotic.</li>
            <li> I love these probiotics.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> I tried many inferior pro biotic , then I found Dr. Ohhiras and I have been sold on it for two years now.</li>
            <li> i seem to have an allergic reaction to many probiotics but not this one.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get it</li>
            <li> Need to order more, works well.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use as directed.</li>
            <li> and I feel better.</li>
            <li> However, it can upset stomach with people with GERD and acid reflux because it has more than just the lactobacillus component.</li>
            <li> The Kampuku soap showed an immediate improvement and thus we were quite pleased with that product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
            <li> I took a chance when ordering the Pro Formula probiotics from Amazon and was pleased to see an expiration date of well in to 2015.  </li>
            <li> Prompt service and feel better on them.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s more aggressive in colonizing the gut.</li>
            <li> easy to take, seems to be good so far so good.  </li>
            <li> We have found these probiotics to be the most quickly balancing, effective and enduring in our bodies.</li>
            <li> When I took them for a whole week, life was good :)</li>
            <li> Stomach a lot more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li> Take on an empty stomach for best results.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like this was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great price and got here super fast.</li>
            <li> We love this product and the original one.</li>
            <li> I love that Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics, both Original and Pro formulas, don&#x27;t require refrigeration.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Ohhira has many different probiotics and all of them are great.</li>
            <li> An easy product to personalize.</li>
            <li> However &amp;#34;Professional Formula&amp;#34; may be too strong for some people&#x27;s digestive systems and they may want to try a milder version.</li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t bc of this type of probiotic because i&#x27;ve taken it before and was completely fine.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in my digestion.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that gut health is important though, so, for now, these are my probiotics of choice.</li>
            <li> (I believe Align is not dairy free).  </li>
            <li> so  important to keep the &amp;#34;good guys&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> Started with the original formula , which was helpful as well as the soap.  </li>
            <li> This probiotic is recommended far and wide as the best and most reliable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an increase of more than 10 whole bucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the top-dollar for me!  </li>
            <li> Amazon usually has the best prices too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would not be without it and definately worth the price!</li>
            <li> A fantastic product, and the best probiotic I&#x27;ve tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other brands, all refrigerated and claiming to be potent).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t verify if any of it is true</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason so many people, including me, pay so much for Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics.  </li>
            <li> He is still breast feeding at present which may also be a cause for the good results.</li>
            <li> This newer formula by Dr. Ohhira includes more types of bacteria than the original formula, and I found it actually works better for me.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I am now 19 weeks pregnant and continue to take them at night.</li>
            <li> It took her almost one more week to return to normal.  </li>
            <li> Gas and bloating so much better and eczema on abdomen is gone, and dry winter skin is much better.  </li>
            <li> It is also great that they are few that do not have to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with Dr. Ohira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula capsules.</li>
            <li> Entirely worth the money.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey , but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also, customer service has been good, with emails from company asking if everything was ok, and offering help if I had any problems or questions, so they have taken customer reviews seriously, which is encouraging.</li>
            <li> Received the shipment right on time.  </li>
            <li> This special formula has the strains that really work.</li>
            <li> It took about a week to notice the full affect; functions are running much smoother now.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple different brands, and I am so happy my doctor recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular and found personally I do better with the pro, and it&#x27;s worth the premium.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of hype about this product - about how its made and the quality of the probiotic bacterial cultures and how they help you maintain essential healthy body bacterial health and get rid of candida etc.</li>
            <li> Helps me with stomach/intestine issues and really bolsters immune system!</li>
            <li> I just assumed it would be higher strength</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey but does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different probiotics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because after all, despite being done with the loading phase, and currently taking more than the recommended follow up doses of 2-4 capsules a day</li>
            <li> Because I rotate probiotics as each  has various benefits, and the research and track record of Dr. O. is outstanding, I really  like to keep this in my  &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; of preventative measures as the immune system starts in the &amp;#34; gut&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It simply keeps you healthy.</li>
            <li> I probably get on my &amp;#34;soap box&amp;#34; more about probiotics than any other preventative procedure and find it a confimation of their value as even now Phillips has a product on the market, you know for sure  when Big Pharm hops on the band wagon, they have &amp;#34;seen the light&amp;#34; (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for a  few years, and I feel better!</li>
            <li> After having long term antibiotic use kill off much of the good bacteria in my gut, this is the only product i have found that helps to restore the balance.</li>
            <li> About a year or so ago, I noticed two things; (1) the softgel capsule was not soft any more; rather, it was a hard, or more accurately crispy gel capsule; (2) it wasn&#x27;t working like it used to-</li>
            <li> , I believe radiation there is still very high  -</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey, but this product actually works, and is great for sensitives stomaches.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been able to function better without having the constant heartburn pain when I was doing something that involved a little strenuousness.</li>
            <li> These probiotics work really fast to restore intestinal health after intense stress or antibiotics.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> After careful review of all the probiotics on the market, I found this to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic inflammation in my stomach and this really has worked&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> If you are having bloating issues, you really should give it a try.</li>
            <li> My husband has IBS and these really help.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you research them and see if they work for you!</li>
            <li> Instead, they give out other products like Align, which may help for some, but contain fillers and excipients that aggravate many people</li>
            <li> Just eat less than two weeks, there should be a better long-term effects of eating.</li>
            <li> I did write the main Ohhira company about it and of course, no word.....</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever left a review for anything I&#x27;ve bought online and the first reason is that I want to gripe about the exorbitant and unreasonable increase in prices!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the higher price, but would recommend the professional formula over the regular formula.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Been buying these for years and highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great probiotic, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This probiotic was highly recommended to me by my chiropractor.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I occasionally try something different that&#x27;s cheaper with a lot of good reviews but nothing holds a candle to these probiotics!</li>
            <li> Since eating the probiotic, stool began to feel normal.</li>
            <li> Better than eating yoghurt all the time, which I can&#x27;t stomach after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I also feel more energy everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> They also go down easily and contain lots of food ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I feel more energized and no more stomach issues.  </li>
            <li> Some have helped but these are the only ones that have worked consistently for me.</li>
            <li> I just began using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> In fine it has been a waste of money and of energies, my gas, spasms and intestinal motility is the same as it was before taking this bogus yet very well marketed product.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality and does exactly what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li> I have since gone on to the Professional Formula.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Professional Formula for over 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> switched to the Professional Formula</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Ohhira for your terrific product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking the original formula and then bumped up to the Professional Formula after a few boxes.</li>
            <li> The fermented contents and particular probiotics in Dr Ohhira&#x27;s have definitely helped my IBS-C.  </li>
            <li> We started with a high dose for the first few days and are now maintaining.  </li>
            <li> well i just wanted it for IBS related problems and after going thru a whole box I still am in the same point where I started it:</li>
            <li> which hence makes even lesser sense for me to shell out so much money for something that could possibly harm my body even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel as much relief as I expected since this is the Professional Formula.</li>
            <li> I started with the regular probiotic, which worked o.k., then switched to the Professional probiotic.  </li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the professional version when I found out</li>
            <li> , I have still given it 3 stars and not the 2 stars that I originally thought of giving as, at least, it did not cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Work so very very well and regulate your body to once again work as it did before gluten began to destroy your intestine.</li>
            <li> The capsules are small and easy to swallow; should be taken twice a day on an empty stomach.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really know if taking them has any different effect on me than any other probiotic.</li>
            <li> After a few days on the Probiotics Professional Formula, I was able to go back to my exercise regimen with kettlebells with only a few minor issues.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago my acupuncturist had me take large doses of the &#x27;non-professional&#x27; (green box) version after taking Cipro.</li>
            <li> For years I relied on the Original Formula to alleviate what is commonly known as heartburn but is really acid reflux, at least that&#x27;s what I believe it to be.</li>
            <li> I take two capsules at night right before going to bed, since the directions say to take at least an hour before or after eating.  </li>
            <li> It is a heartburn condition caused by antibiotics when I was sick that began reducing the good bacteria in my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Even I have no major issues with my health</li>
            <li> I take mine on an empty stomach which can be rough the first few times doing so</li>
            <li> I plan on taking this for a long time</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this product for approximately 3 months before I notice a daily consistent difference.  </li>
            <li> This will do the trick in either direction (too fast from antibiotics or too slow from something else).  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been taking these for a 3-4 years after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li> Buy the basic ones, save your money and do your research - there are other supplementary products that can help with candida that helped me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other probiotics but this one seems to be a notch or 2 above all the others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is labeled professional formula.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is you have to wait either an hour before you eat or an hour and a half after you eat.</li>
            <li> so therefore, I&#x27;m considering really really hard whether I should continue purchasing this brand, given moreover, that these are from Japan, and regardless how far the production &amp; fermentation place is from Fukushima</li>
            <li> but i wish i hadn&#x27;t spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;michael</li>
            <li> I have not really seen a difference after taking Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics after taking about 50 caps (2 per day).  </li>
            <li> it is aged 2 yrs longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but seems to be worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands of Probiotics.  </li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune disease that must be supplemented and balanced with the help of probiotics among other things.</li>
            <li> works well but is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I have not found myself suffering from the usual pregnancy constipation (very regular!)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare with any other brand because have not used any others.</li>
            <li> But after having it on hand for a month, I came down with a cold/flu that was going around.  </li>
            <li> Other Probiotics make me gassy, this one just works!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than half the price of the 120 capsules box for half the number of capsules.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Along with the Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Kampuku soap, I purchased these probiotics for one of my children to address a slight acne issue.  </li>
            <li> it works for me everyday and every night i recommend it to all my working friends who have stomach problems</li>
            <li> Have been around others who have been sick with various illnesses, and so far, have stayed well,  so feel my immune system is also  strengthened.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re system ever needs regulating it usually lies in the gut bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive, yes they are tiny and yes they do NOT have to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past year</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try and update this review in a few months if I can recall to do so!</li>
            <li> Been using them for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with this version and got sick (a reaction to too much).</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to know whether or not it&#x27;s working, but I like the product.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately the product slowed down my already slow digestion.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when purchasing it from Amazon I was unable to view the back of the package as sometimes you can where it would have shown the content.</li>
            <li> I see no harm, yet no good.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived to see that it only has 600 million CFU per capsule and</li>
            <li> I like the story behind these probiotics.</li>
            <li> This is frustrating sometimes trying to schedule eating however, the results make up for it.</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive, it is working.</li>
            <li> Megaflora Plus from Megafood ( 50 billion per capsule) bought at a healthfood store for $68 (expensive, recommend the Vsl#3 take two before or after a meal) and a drink of three tablespoons of DIATOMACEOUS EARTH powder-food graded, diluted in a cup of water (please research it).</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> No wonder its so expensive.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from allergies or a cold or any type of digest problem</li>
            <li> I took this for a few days and had horrible bloating and diarrhea.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My niece recommended this product.  If you&#x27;re system ever needs regulating it usually lies in the gut bacteria.  This will do the trick in either direction (too fast from antibiotics or too slow from something else).  Doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated and very effective.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula.  Have tried other brands of Probiotics.  This is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Simply the best probiotic on the planet everyone should use it. If you suffer from allergies or a cold or any type of digest problem it&#x27;s a cure for all 3 stay on it for life.</li>
            <li> Best probiotic I have used so far.  I have used most on the market, this was recommended by Lyme/Bartonella specialist. Dr. James Schaller.</li>
            <li> Best probiotic ever! Worth the higher price, but would recommend the professional formula over the regular formula. I use it when I am prescribed anti-biotics.</li>
            <li> I AS patients, intestinal improve very good to me. Just eat less than two weeks, there should be a better long-term effects of eating.Since eating the probiotic, stool began to feel normal. Stomach a lot more comfortable than before. Worth buying!</li>
            <li> Started with the original formula , which was helpful as well as the soap.  Gas and bloating so much better and eczema on abdomen is gone, and dry winter skin is much better.  I have since gone on to the Professional Formula. Although it is expensive, it is working. Have been around others who have been sick with various illnesses, and so far, have stayed well,  so feel my immune system is also  strengthened.  Presently, only taking once daily, but will begin taking morning and evening.  Also, customer service has been good, with emails from company asking if everything was ok, and offering help if I had any problems or questions, so they have taken customer reviews seriously, which is encouraging.</li>
            <li> Fine product good price</li>
            <li> excellent product, best price from this seller.</li>
            <li> Have been using this probiotic for a couple of years, and it works! Better than eating yoghurt all the time, which I can&#x27;t stomach after a few days of use. Everyone should take a probiotic, and this is a good one!</li>
            <li> all the info on this product was excellent.  unfortunately the product slowed down my already slow digestion.  i&#x27;m glad it works for so many people and send well wishes to everyone in the company but i wish i hadn&#x27;t spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;michael</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been taking these for a 3-4 years after trying several other brands. We have found these probiotics to be the most quickly balancing, effective and enduring in our bodies. We continue to take them on and off basis to keep our internal system in balance. We call them &amp;#34;black gold&amp;#34; of probiotics.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading that a god is contained in it and helps you with everything even pimples....talk about psychosis and the placebo effect...well i just wanted it for IBS related problems and after going thru a whole box I still am in the same point where I started it: NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER, it has been like taking a sugar pill.....I did write the main Ohhira company about it and of course, no word..... In fine it has been a waste of money and of energies, my gas, spasms and intestinal motility is the same as it was before taking this bogus yet very well marketed product.</li>
            <li> This product is THE BEST there is for a probiotic. I love it and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. Thank you and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> We love this product and the original one.</li>
            <li> The package had a March 2014 date and I received it in September/ October, having better results with VSL#3 (112.5 billion per capsule) the living shield bought at Walgreens for $45, in combination with Megaflora Plus from Megafood ( 50 billion per capsule) bought at a healthfood store for $68 (expensive, recommend the Vsl#3 take two before or after a meal) and a drink of three tablespoons of DIATOMACEOUS EARTH powder-food graded, diluted in a cup of water (please research it). Hope it helps anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to improve your gut flora!  This newer formula by Dr. Ohhira includes more types of bacteria than the original formula, and I found it actually works better for me.  I take one between meals twice a day to help me digest the extra fish oil I must take for ADHD.</li>
            <li> Great but very costly!!</li>
            <li> Thank you.  This is exactly what I ordered.  I have been taking Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Professional Formula for over 2 years now.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Been buying these for years and highly recommend them.  As far as I am concerned, they are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of hype about this product - about how its made and the quality of the probiotic bacterial cultures and how they help you maintain essential healthy body bacterial health and get rid of candida etc. I bought 8 different probiotics and tested them in my lab because I am a biochemist and I had candida. There was essentially no difference. Buy the basic ones, save your money and do your research - there are other supplementary products that can help with candida that helped me.</li>
            <li> Use them daily and they work great!  I have used them for a couple of years. Helps me with stomach/intestine issues and really bolsters immune system!</li>
            <li> I take this probiotic twice daily with wonderful results.  Would recommend to anyone for help with gut flora.  Will continue to purchase and use this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this product for approximately 3 months before I notice a daily consistent difference.  I had two surgeries a month apart  and ended up with a lot of constipation, gas bloating and yeast problems. I did take this product as directed on the box.  It is still working well and I will be receiving my next box soon.  I plan on taking this for a long time but I will probably lower the dose for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I was having pain/abnormal stools.  This product has cleared up that problem.  I am thankful. I will continue to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second box of these. I like the story behind these probiotics. I can&#x27;t verify if any of it is true and I don&#x27;t really know if taking them has any different effect on me than any other probiotic. I don&#x27;t feel any different. I do believe that gut health is important though, so, for now, these are my probiotics of choice.</li>
            <li> These probiotics work really fast to restore intestinal health after intense stress or antibiotics. Works best if taken in the AM before eating or drinking anything (except water). You will feel relief in a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen a difference after taking Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics after taking about 50 caps (2 per day).  I see no harm, yet no good.  Possibly there are unseen benefits.  Will probably try another type.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in my digestion.  I am no longer constipated .  I also feel more energy everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife took one week of the recommended dosage leaving her totally congested, so she stopped taking them.  It took her almost one more week to return to normal.  As for myself, this is the third week and with hope of being regular it hasn&#x27;t made a bit of difference.  I am going to continue the product with hope it will kick in.  If it works I will write a review.  Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> For years I relied on the Original Formula to alleviate what is commonly known as heartburn but is really acid reflux, at least that&#x27;s what I believe it to be. Anyway, the product worked like a charm. About a year or so ago, I noticed two things; (1) the softgel capsule was not soft any more; rather, it was a hard, or more accurately crispy gel capsule; (2) it wasn&#x27;t working like it used to- I had to take two, three, or even four capsules to alleviate my symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the Professional Formula but it made no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the change in the type of capsule has somehow reduced the efficacy of the product. Or, if the capsule change also accompanied a change in the formula itself. All I know is that it no longer works for me and that the moment when it stopped working was associated with an obvious change in the capsule.</li>
            <li> It has helped me auth my IBS and skin issues. I love them! Two hours after taking it,  if you keep your feet warm,  then you can expect to go.</li>
            <li> Very effective in helping to boost immune system. Product arrived quickly. Completely satisfied with Dr. Ohira&#x27;s Probiotics Professional Formula capsules.</li>
            <li> easy to take, seems to be good so far so good.  Sorry nothing more to say about it just now..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best probiotic on the market.  Very effective, easy to take and ideal for a mobile lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I have found that of the 3 Dr.Ohhira formulas, this one suits my body best. This product is stable at room temperature, so I always keep a couple in my purse.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived to see that it only has 600 million CFU per capsule and the originals have 900 million. Why should these be so much more expensive? it isn&#x27;t explained.  Unfortunately when purchasing it from Amazon I was unable to view the back of the package as sometimes you can where it would have shown the content. I&#x27;m not sure why this is labeled professional formula.  it is aged 2 yrs longer but I guess I don&#x27;t understand why that would make it better.  I just assumed it would be higher strength and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> stuff good but overpriced</li>
            <li> it helps, was recommended by nutritionist</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve tried other probiotics but this one seems to be a notch or 2 above all the others.  Also it&#x27;s great not having to be overly concerned with refrigeration issues.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics for years and now have my husband using it also.  We are up in age and need all the help we can get.</li>
            <li> This is a quality probiotic.  I started with the regular probiotic, which worked o.k., then switched to the Professional probiotic.  It works MUCH better.  The capsules are small and easy to swallow; should be taken twice a day on an empty stomach.  It took about a week to notice the full affect; functions are running much smoother now.  I&#x27;ve had problems for 25 years and never used anything close to this.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I&#x27;ll order again, soon!!!</li>
            <li> I love them. Work great. Been using them for years.</li>
            <li> My doctor referred me to this probiotic for leaky gut. Within weeks I could notice a difference with improved energy and a healthier GI system. If you have problems with your GI system, I would recommend this. The only downside is you have to wait either an hour before you eat or an hour and a half after you eat. This is frustrating sometimes trying to schedule eating however, the results make up for it.</li>
            <li> This product has literally turned my health around!!</li>
            <li> This is a great probiotic pill.  I feel more energized and no more stomach issues.  I feel more at eased.  :)  It&#x27;s pretty pricey but does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This probiotic is recommended far and wide as the best and most reliable. It was delivered fast and in pristine condition. Good health awaits me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different probiotics. I&#x27;ve tried the ever popular Three Lac and Five Lac and they seemed to not do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking the original formula and then bumped up to the Professional Formula after a few boxes. These are easier to take than most probiotics that need to be refrigerated. However, I agree with another reviewer, that if you take this with a meal it will act more like a digestive enzyme. I take mine on an empty stomach which can be rough the first few times doing so but I feel it is more effective taken this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great probiotic, I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s worth the price if you need a good quality probiotic.</li>
            <li> Great price for an outstanding probiotic with it&#x27;s own prebiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probiotic is fermented for 5 years and doesn&#x27;t require refrigeration</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products because he feels it is one of the best full-spectrum probiotics on the market.  I recently upgraded to the professional version when I found out I had leaky gut.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m yet 100% so it&#x27;s hard to know whether or not it&#x27;s working, but I like the product.  I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive, yes they are tiny and yes they do NOT have to be refrigerated. For the past 3 years I occasionally try something different that&#x27;s cheaper with a lot of good reviews but nothing holds a candle to these probiotics! I have an autoimmune disease that must be supplemented and balanced with the help of probiotics among other things. Nothing else comes close to the results felt with these. I will never switch again. Entirely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever left a review for anything I&#x27;ve bought online and the first reason is that I want to gripe about the exorbitant and unreasonable increase in prices!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purchase, I bought 3 of these 120 capsules boxes and each was priced at around USD74.53. Now they&#x27;re priced at USD85.99! That&#x27;s an increase of more than 10 whole bucks! And I still need to convert it to my country&#x27;s currency :&amp;#60; If you look at the 60 capsules box, it&#x27;s being sold for USD42.49. That&#x27;s less than half the price of the 120 capsules box for half the number of capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So either I&#x27;m gonna buy the 60 capsules box instead, or I&#x27;m not going to buy this brand of probiotics anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because after all, despite being done with the loading phase, and currently taking more than the recommended follow up doses of 2-4 capsules a day (I&#x27;m taking 6 each day, split into 2 dosages, and I&#x27;m even on to my 2nd box), I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement in any part of my life - whether in terms of my skin and eczema problem, or in terms of my food intolerances and gut &amp; digestive issues. This is my second reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so therefore, I&#x27;m considering really really hard whether I should continue purchasing this brand, given moreover, that these are from Japan, and regardless how far the production &amp; fermentation place is from Fukushima, I believe radiation there is still very high  - which hence makes even lesser sense for me to shell out so much money for something that could possibly harm my body even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, I have still given it 3 stars and not the 2 stars that I originally thought of giving as, at least, it did not cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I love these probiotics. They truly make a difference and make you feel great. I have tried others and these are by far the best. I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason so many people, including me, pay so much for Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics.  These are definitely top-notch probiotics.  I work with GI doctors and they don&#x27;t know about this product b/c it&#x27;s not sampled by the pharma companies. Instead, they give out other products like Align, which may help for some, but contain fillers and excipients that aggravate many people (I believe Align is not dairy free).  The fermented contents and particular probiotics in Dr Ohhira&#x27;s have definitely helped my IBS-C.  My skin always improves when I&#x27;m on it too! It&#x27;s worth the top-dollar for me!  Amazon usually has the best prices too. Oh, and they don&#x27;t need to be refrigerated which is super-convenient!</li>
            <li> Works well and speedy delivery . I tried many inferior pro biotic , then I found Dr. Ohhiras and I have been sold on it for two years now. A bit pricey , but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product! Best probiotic for digestion issues!</li>
            <li> * * * There is NON like it.  It takes 7 years to make this products.  Reviews are off the chart. This product is by far the BEST Probiotic on the market today. No wonder its so expensive. Co. Must add NON-GMO project verified labeling.</li>
            <li> Taking the probiotics  for &amp;#34;non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy&amp;#34; and it seems to be giving me some relief from the pain associated with the neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Great product! It seems to be working. I do feel like it has helped my immune system. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> After careful review of all the probiotics on the market, I found this to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just as described.</li>
            <li> My naturopath,regular internist &amp; chiropractor all recommend this product and it has been of great benefit for me and while taking it during nursing my baby too.</li>
            <li> works well but is pretty expensive. i seem to have an allergic reaction to many probiotics but not this one. Glad to be able to get it</li>
            <li> Need to order more, works well.</li>
            <li> Dr. Ohhira has many different probiotics and all of them are great. Have taken a variety of probiotics over the years to help with food allergies and digestive discomfort. Some have helped but these are the only ones that have worked consistently for me.</li>
            <li> Because I rotate probiotics as each  has various benefits, and the research and track record of Dr. O. is outstanding, I really  like to keep this in my  &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; of preventative measures as the immune system starts in the &amp;#34; gut&amp;#34;! so  important to keep the &amp;#34;good guys&amp;#34; in the flora of the colon to erradicate the &amp;#34;bad guys&amp;#34; that seek to invade.  I probably get on my &amp;#34;soap box&amp;#34; more about probiotics than any other preventative procedure and find it a confimation of their value as even now Phillips has a product on the market, you know for sure  when Big Pharm hops on the band wagon, they have &amp;#34;seen the light&amp;#34; (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MLG</li>
            <li> I love this product, its the best probiotic I have used.  I have had chronic inflammation in my stomach and this really has worked&lt;br /&gt;in taking away the discomfort.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with H Pylori, a stomach bacteria! Since taking these probiotics I have never felt better!</li>
            <li> Work so very very well and regulate your body to once again work as it did before gluten began to destroy your intestine.</li>
            <li> Good value and in to my knowledge the best probiotic on the market with the best results. However &amp;#34;Professional Formula&amp;#34; may be too strong for some people&#x27;s digestive systems and they may want to try a milder version.</li>
            <li> Received the shipment right on time.  After reading reviews and doing personal research, decided to use in effort to assist in healing digestive issues.  Still too soon to report outcome.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Everyone should get this. My husband can now eat ice cream with out a reaction. The stuff works!</li>
            <li> works wonders! It&#x27;s expensive but seems to be worth it. If you are having bloating issues, you really should give it a try. Be sure to use as directed. Take 1hr before eating. It does not work if you eat before the hour is up.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey, but this product actually works, and is great for sensitives stomaches. I have tried multiple different brands, and I am so happy my doctor recommended this brand. Since using, I have never missed a day. Really a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My husband has IBS and these really help.</li>
            <li> This probiotic was highly recommended to me by my chiropractor.  I have been using it for the past year and it has been very effective.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for a  few years, and I feel better! Before, I tended to get a lot of gas. I even saw a specialist who said I may need a colonoscopy (at age 31?). I added probiotics to my diet and found that is no longer an issue - and my immune system is awesome. I am now 19 weeks pregnant and continue to take them at night. I have not found myself suffering from the usual pregnancy constipation (very regular!) and credit these probiotics! I tried the regular and found personally I do better with the pro, and it&#x27;s worth the premium.</li>
            <li> This version of is stronger than the &#x27;non-professional&#x27; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago my acupuncturist had me take large doses of the &#x27;non-professional&#x27; (green box) version after taking Cipro. I tried it with this version and got sick (a reaction to too much). This is a stronger dose and I&#x27;d recommend someone ease into it (i.e. one capsule at a time). Obviously consult your doctor etc -- just, when they say this is stronger -- it IS stronger.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> My son contracted C. difficile while fighting pneumonia in our local hospital.  While NOT recommending this as a treatment, we have kept him on this product and it has not returned.  It&#x27;s almost been a year.  We started with a high dose for the first few days and are now maintaining.  He is still breast feeding at present which may also be a cause for the good results.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like this was worth the price. I didn&#x27;t feel as much relief as I expected since this is the Professional Formula. I think I&#x27;ll keep looking and trying others.</li>
            <li> My Dr. told me to take this product.  She sells it and it&#x27;s very expensive but Amazon had it at a great price.  So far, so good.  It&#x27;s working and I feel better.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my chiropractor.  However, it can upset stomach with people with GERD and acid reflux because it has more than just the lactobacillus component.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use this, it works great.  I take two capsules at night right before going to bed, since the directions say to take at least an hour before or after eating.  I occasionally get constipated, and have never been very regular, and I feel this has helped when I take it.  When I took them for a whole week, life was good :)</li>
            <li> Great price and got here super fast.</li>
            <li> Along with the Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Kampuku soap, I purchased these probiotics for one of my children to address a slight acne issue.  The Kampuku soap showed an immediate improvement and thus we were quite pleased with that product.  Can&#x27;t make a call yet on the Pro Formula probiotics as I believe you have to use them for 2-3 months.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more so I can give the product a fair shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to mention is the statement on the formal Dr. Ohhira web page warning not to buy products from Amazon as the expiration date and freshness of the product can&#x27;t be guaranteed.  I took a chance when ordering the Pro Formula probiotics from Amazon and was pleased to see an expiration date of well in to 2015.  I have no trepidations about future orders through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try and update this review in a few months if I can recall to do so!</li>
            <li> Prompt service and feel better on them.</li>
            <li> This probiotic works with 99% of the public.  No refrigeration is needed.  Helps also if you have problems with gas.  Keeps your gut flora in-line.</li>
            <li> This special formula has the strains that really work. Even I have no major issues with my health I take them as a supplement to keep up my immune system. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best probiotics around.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t purchase from an unauthorized dealer, you risk getting spoiled product! I took this for a few days and had horrible bloating and diarrhea. I know it wasn&#x27;t bc of this type of probiotic because i&#x27;ve taken it before and was completely fine.</li>
            <li> Other Probiotics make me gassy, this one just works! After having long term antibiotic use kill off much of the good bacteria in my gut, this is the only product i have found that helps to restore the balance. Take on an empty stomach for best results.</li>
            <li> Upon starting using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics, my heartburn and indigestion seemed to lessen.  I was taking prescription Nexium and with the probiotics, it has doubled the effect of reducing my heartburn and what seems to be gas pressure in my stomach and lower chest. I&#x27;ve been to the doctor&#x27;s several times for the heartburn and had stress tests done.  It is a heartburn condition caused by antibiotics when I was sick that began reducing the good bacteria in my stomach.  After a few days on the Probiotics Professional Formula, I was able to go back to my exercise regimen with kettlebells with only a few minor issues.  Since then, I have been able to function better without having the constant heartburn pain when I was doing something that involved a little strenuousness. Any time I feel the heartburn and pressure coming on, I take 1 capsule and the problem dissipates after about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s more aggressive in colonizing the gut.</li>
            <li> But after having it on hand for a month, I came down with a cold/flu that was going around.  I took 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and by the 2nd day, my symptoms had abated dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not be without it and definately worth the price!</li>
            <li> These are the best probiotics bar none. It is also great that they are few that do not have to be refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous probiotics, including the Klaire labs thera-biotic powder, and I was still fighting constant constipation. I just began using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s and all I can say is WOW! A fantastic product, and the best probiotic I&#x27;ve tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other brands, all refrigerated and claiming to be potent). It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it works for me everyday and every night i recommend it to all my working friends who have stomach problems</li>
            <li> This product is high quality and does exactly what it is expected to do. It simply keeps you healthy. Our family can&#x27;t be without them. This is the best price I have found. Locally I would pay $120 for the same amount.</li>
            <li> Been using them for the past year.  Recommended by a medical person. They are the only ones I have used  and will continue to use.  Can&#x27;t compare with any other brand because have not used any others.</li>
            <li> Been using for almost year now.  Best probiotic out there!</li>
            <li> I love that Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics, both Original and Pro formulas, don&#x27;t require refrigeration.  They also go down easily and contain lots of food ingredients.  The only caveat I have is that they may not work for everyone based on the needs of each person&#x27;s body.  I highly recommend you research them and see if they work for you!</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Ohhira for your terrific product. I take it as prescribed and sometimes increase or decrease depending on my digestive condition. An easy product to personalize.</li>
