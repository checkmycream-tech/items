            <li>my own based on my personal use of the product.</li>
            <li>An ounce of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure.</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on high-end cosmetics and multiple prescription cream, including steroids with no change in my skin until I tried this wonderful hydrating anti wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li>But shortly after beginning this she started noticing a nice change in her face.</li>
            <li>As I have been getting older, I have noticed more and more wrinkles starting to appear on my face.</li>
            <li>The very first thing that I noticed about this serum was the pretty, shiny packaging.</li>
            <li>Since I have purchased, I have an whole new beauty routine and my skin is better for it.</li>
            <li>This has a lot of great stuff in it, green tea, sage, vitamin E, jojoba oil, lavender, lemon, witch hazel, and rosemary!</li>
            <li>This actually makes me to feel my skin very smooth and appear fresh whie I wake up.</li>
            <li>In just first two weeks I started feeling my wrinkles and freckles smoothing out.</li>
            <li>The lovely gel consistency of Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum helps not only to moisturize your face and neck, but to help minimize the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>Alice Nouveau anti-aging serum is a blend of organic and natural ingredients and is free from alcohols, parabens, and sulphates, which may irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really pretty, too.</li>
            <li>Not that it matters, but I navigate towards pretty packages</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of sensitivity when I first apply it</li>
            <li>Best of all, this serum will last such a long time so it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Never heard of it before, but I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>It is a must have for anyone who wants to look younger and confident.</li>
            <li>I have the normal smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin on my face,and I have tried too many creams and motions over the years to count.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but works good and fast, so much better than other products.</li>
            <li>Natural young looking skin is so easy to obtain now as long as you have Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum! :)</li>
            <li>It also reduces the fine lines that I am starting to get on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Just one pump of the anti-wrinkle serum covers a large area and about two pumps covers your whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural fresh scent to it that I really like.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but nothing seemed to work for me as much as Alice Nouvea Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum.</li>
            <li>and it really worked for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really saw nothing, after 2 wks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed a morning time skincare routine that helps keep my skin looking fresh all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;First, I start by cleansing, and 3x a week,</li>
            <li>but my skin is much softer &amp; smoother since I’ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Even my mom in India loves it and wants me to buy one for her.</li>
            <li>was really working for them either.</li>
            <li>I felt my skin younger and shinier and it looked very fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and refreshed, I’ve been really liking it in my evening routine!</li>

            <li>At first it made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This is an investment I can live with!</li>
            <li>I look younger and less tired, and looking good makes me feel good too.</li>
            <li>was totally clear!!</li>
            <li>For anyone who is starting to show the signs of aging, this product starts working pretty fast.</li>
            <li>With this I had a new boost of energy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a health kick since the new year</li>
            <li>It is my number one skincare product that I just don&#x27;t want to live without.</li>
            <li>I thought the cursive logo was cute, usually skincare packaging is pretty</li>
            <li>I believe you have to start early to age gracefully and combat wrinkles!</li>
            <li>She started preserving her skin early!</li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and supple!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and skip the more expensive products; this is a five star serum at the right price!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to reuse it for complete clear skin!</li>
            <li>I live a very stressful life and you can definitely tell by just looking at me.  </li>
            <li>Over a period of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li>anti-wrinkle serum makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like a few others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have noticed results since using it for 2 weeks now and even my friends can feel a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried  quite a few different serums over the past year or so, but my new, absolute favorite is this hydrating anti-wrinkle serum from Alice Nouveau!</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with dry patches on certain parts of my face and have noticed this serum helps to provide much-needed moisture.</li>
            <li>This serum is easier to use than a lot of other serums, thanks to the luxurious thickness of this serum combined with the easy-to-use pump that allows me to only pump as much as I want it</li>
            <li>Since it doesn’t take much serum for each use, this 1 ounce pump bottle will last me for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The antioxidants in your facial serum can take up to 4 weeks to completely soak into the skin and remove toxins that cause dullness, dryness, and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, and it has a soothing effect thanks to the natural ingredients like Green Tea, and Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li>It worked for her to ease a few laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Few more days, my smile lines have drastically decreased.</li>
            <li>, She likes to try new products as long as she doesn&#x27;t have any allergy reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but I&#x27;m active in preventing them.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face was so dry that it made me look much older than I actually was.</li>
            <li>I am a little obsessed with having great skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li>I apply it and after a few weeks I have already seen the little lines on my forehead getting smaller and my face looking smoother and more youthful.  </li>

            <li> my own based on my personal use of the product.</li>
            <li> An ounce of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on high-end cosmetics and multiple prescription cream, including steroids with no change in my skin until I tried this wonderful hydrating anti wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li> But shortly after beginning this she started noticing a nice change in her face.</li>
            <li> As I have been getting older, I have noticed more and more wrinkles starting to appear on my face.</li>
            <li> The very first thing that I noticed about this serum was the pretty, shiny packaging.</li>
            <li> Since I have purchased, I have an whole new beauty routine and my skin is better for it.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of great stuff in it, green tea, sage, vitamin E, jojoba oil, lavender, lemon, witch hazel, and rosemary!</li>
            <li> This actually makes me to feel my skin very smooth and appear fresh whie I wake up.</li>

            <li> Not that it matters, but I navigate towards pretty packages</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of sensitivity when I first apply it</li>
            <li> Best of all, this serum will last such a long time so it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Never heard of it before, but I was willing to try anything.</li>

            <li> but nothing seemed to work for me as much as Alice Nouvea Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum.</li>
            <li> and it really worked for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really saw nothing, after 2 wks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a morning time skincare routine that helps keep my skin looking fresh all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;First, I start by cleansing, and 3x a week,</li>
            <li> but my skin is much softer &amp; smoother since I’ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Even my mom in India loves it and wants me to buy one for her.</li>
            <li> was really working for them either.</li>

            <li> It is my number one skincare product that I just don&#x27;t want to live without.</li>
            <li> I thought the cursive logo was cute, usually skincare packaging is pretty</li>
            <li> I believe you have to start early to age gracefully and combat wrinkles!</li>
            <li> She started preserving her skin early!</li>

            <li> Do yourself a favor and skip the more expensive products; this is a five star serum at the right price!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to reuse it for complete clear skin!</li>
            <li> I live a very stressful life and you can definitely tell by just looking at me.  </li>
            <li> Over a period of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li> anti-wrinkle serum makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like a few others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have noticed results since using it for 2 weeks now and even my friends can feel a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried  quite a few different serums over the past year or so, but my new, absolute favorite is this hydrating anti-wrinkle serum from Alice Nouveau!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dry patches on certain parts of my face and have noticed this serum helps to provide much-needed moisture.</li>
            <li> This serum is easier to use than a lot of other serums, thanks to the luxurious thickness of this serum combined with the easy-to-use pump that allows me to only pump as much as I want it</li>
            <li> Since it doesn’t take much serum for each use, this 1 ounce pump bottle will last me for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The antioxidants in your facial serum can take up to 4 weeks to completely soak into the skin and remove toxins that cause dullness, dryness, and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh, and it has a soothing effect thanks to the natural ingredients like Green Tea, and Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> It worked for her to ease a few laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Few more days, my smile lines have drastically decreased.</li>
            <li> , She likes to try new products as long as she doesn&#x27;t have any allergy reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but I&#x27;m active in preventing them.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face was so dry that it made me look much older than I actually was.</li>
            <li> I am a little obsessed with having great skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> I apply it and after a few weeks I have already seen the little lines on my forehead getting smaller and my face looking smoother and more youthful.  </li>
            <li> This product has done a good job of keeping my skin from getting worse and slowly working on making my skin healthier.</li>
            <li> I personally have had difficulty with resurfacing products due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mean I apply one thin layer, and then a second layer on fresh clean skin before I go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to notice a difference in the lines and wrinkles on my face, but I do notice the moisture and hydration has improved.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take very long to dry, and there’s no sticky feeling left over.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product before, but not I am a huge believer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long</li>
            <li> After continuous use of Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum, many of my friends have really commented on my skin and my appearnace that I look shiny and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and I actually never felt shy in confessing the reason behind this!</li>
            <li> The bottle has 1 oz, but since I only need a little bit for each use, this will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer unless you&#x27;re really dry.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m almost out of my 20&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;s time to start taking extra care of my skin, before I start to notice deep wrinkles, dark spots, and other signs of aging.</li>
            <li> It does take some time, and will only slightly improve already existing wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> Skeptical was putting it mildly of how I felt when ordering.</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks and have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that will hydrate my skin without any harsh chemicals, and that will also soothe my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> However, I do not know if I will purchase it again due to the  increase in cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Facial serums can give you added moisture and you&#x27;ll want to use a serum to get added nutrients deeper into the layers of your skin where a regular moisturizer is not able to reach.  </li>
            <li> For the past several years stress and hormones had taken a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> , it reduces the appearance of dark spots and helps prevent clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recently noticed how my wrinkles are slowly fading or improving.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive combination skin but have not experienced any redness or irritation from using this serum &amp; it does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter months, a problem that has only gotten worse with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2and a half months now</li>
            <li> and I figured that this product was going to be like all the other over the counter ones that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The lid is tight so not even a drop of serum will be wasted on a spill.  </li>
            <li> This is a little heavy for daytime use, but I do like applying it at night.</li>
            <li> It contains retinol, hyaluronic acid, green tea, Vitamin E, and jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> It is a hydrating anti-wrinkle serum, soaks in in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after using for a few weeks, but for $35, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night after I have cleansed &amp; dried my face so that it can work while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I tried a few home remedies and I had no luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Some were inexpensive ,and some were more costly, but until I used this, I  suffered horribly.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is to soon to tell</li>
            <li> I am 32 but a smoker and and often stay up late.</li>
            <li> Shady!</li>
            <li> She is scared I am going to look like a pug in another 10 years, and if I don&#x27;t oblige, she will administer serious consequences.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> It has a faint smell, it reminds me of Chai tea, probably comes from all those herbs and the green</li>
            <li> The effects of aging can be very depressing for some, but with this product you can fight back.</li>
            <li> Around my eyes and mouth, I have always had a tired wrinkle look.  </li>
            <li> I also have not experienced any breakouts from using Alice Nouveau.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> There are a lot of very expensive creams out there that do not work half as well as this one.</li>

            <li> A great product to reverse the effects of aging. If you desire your skin to be healthy, hydrated, and younger looking then this is the perfect product for you. This product has done a good job of keeping my skin from getting worse and slowly working on making my skin healthier. I have recently noticed how my wrinkles are slowly fading or improving. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It has been so important to me in my career that I look my best and I was starting to feel like I wasn&#x27;t. With this I had a new boost of energy. It smells great and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy. I now have the confidence I did when I really was the  age that I look now!! :)</li>
            <li> My mom is in her mid 40&#x27;s now and she take great care of her skin, She likes to try new products as long as she doesn&#x27;t have any allergy reaction to it. I decided to buy her this serum for her birthday since I saw great reviews online so I guess it should be good. After a couple weeks, my mom asked me where did I get this product? She absolutely loves it. The serum is not greasy, light, and soften her skin. I&#x27;m glad that I bought her this wonderful skin care product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my face,and I have tried too many creams and motions over the years to count. Some were inexpensive ,and some were more costly, but until I used this, I  suffered horribly. The skin on my face was so dry that it made me look much older than I actually was. Once I started using this, my skin became supple and looks younger every day. I have had lots of compliments, so it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for five weeks now, applying it both in the morning and at night on my face and neck. I have seen a significant improvement in the condition of my skin. This is the best serum that I have ever used. However, I do not know if I will purchase it again due to the  increase in cost. I paid $19.95 for it the latter part of April and it is now $35.00 from the same seller.</li>
            <li> My wife is making me put this on my face at night. She is scared I am going to look like a pug in another 10 years, and if I don&#x27;t oblige, she will administer serious consequences. I totally did not think this serum would make one difference at all, and I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t so I could tell her I told her so.  As with most things, though, she was/is probably right.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feels smoother. It looks lighter. And best of all, the wife is happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had my doubts about it at first; I have been looking for something to smooth the lines on my forehead and the creases under my eyes for a while now and I figured that this product was going to be like all the other over the counter ones that I have tried in the past. But I was wrong! I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long but I can already begin to see that it is making a difference. Another thing I like about it is that the product is not oily or sticky like some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of great stuff in it, green tea, sage, vitamin E, jojoba oil, lavender, lemon, witch hazel, and rosemary! It has a faint smell, it reminds me of Chai tea, probably comes from all those herbs and the green tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a plastic tube with an airtight pump, and the serum itself is a thick-ish gel, I use two pumps for my whole face, and it spreads out very nicely. It doesn’t take very long to dry, and there’s no sticky feeling left over. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and refreshed, I’ve been really liking it in my evening routine! The bottle has 1 oz, but since I only need a little bit for each use, this will last me quite a while. I thought the cursive logo was cute, usually skincare packaging is pretty blah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this serum in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> A great product to reverse the effects of aging. If you desire your skin to be healthy, hydrated, and younger looking then this is the perfect product for you. The Anti-Wrinkle Serum helps reduce expression line and ultimately make the user look better and feel better. The effects of aging can be very depressing for some, but with this product you can fight back.</li>
            <li> I bought this on ebay a couple of months back because I was looking for a replacement for my Sunday Riley Bionic Anti Aging Cream. (I buy it from Nordstrom) Sunday Riley costs $225, its very expensive, I know, but I got it as a gift from my husband, it came in a set of skin creams and I am only 27 but I am obsessed with my skin! I believe you have to start early to age gracefully and combat wrinkles! My mom 52 but she looks 30! I kid you not! She started preserving her skin early! Anyway, I was looking on for something to replace it because it is very expensive, but it makes my skin feel like silk! So I wanted something just as effective. I have tried the cheaper anti wrinkle serums, but I could not find anything like my Sunday Riley. So I decided I would have to increase my price range, but I still didn&#x27;t want to go back to Sunday Riley price! So I was browsing on ebay to see if they had some cheaper Sunday Riley. I didn&#x27;t find any but I found this. I had not previously heard of Alice Nouveau but the reviews were good and the ebay listing was ending in an hour so I bid on it and won. When I recieved I used It just like my Sunday Riley- once in the morning and once at night. Its been 3 months now and this has kept my skin silky soft and smooth! My complexion is brighter and I have even started to use it on my hands. It keeps them soft and supple! I have officially found a replacement for my Sunday Riley. This is an investment I can live with!</li>
            <li> A great product. I had my doubts when I first bought it because there are so many products and serums out there but nothing seemed to work for me as much as Alice Nouvea Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum. I decided to give it a shot and it really worked for my skin. In just first two weeks I started feeling my wrinkles and freckles smoothing out. I felt my skin younger and shinier and it looked very fresh. It simply my skin hydrating and glowing all the time. Simply love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The lovely gel consistency of Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum helps not only to moisturize your face and neck, but to help minimize the signs of aging.  Wrinkles, fine lines, and skin tone will improve with twice-daily use of this Alice Nouveau serum.  Not only that, it reduces the appearance of dark spots and helps prevent clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Alice Nouveau anti-aging serum is a blend of organic and natural ingredients and is free from alcohols, parabens, and sulphates, which may irritate your skin.  It contains retinol, hyaluronic acid, green tea, Vitamin E, and jojoba oil.  Your serum is manufactured in the USA under strict controls in an FDA approved facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial serums can give you added moisture and you&#x27;ll want to use a serum to get added nutrients deeper into the layers of your skin where a regular moisturizer is not able to reach.  The antioxidants in your facial serum can take up to 4 weeks to completely soak into the skin and remove toxins that cause dullness, dryness, and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a sturdy bottle with a pump that won&#x27;t clog or break.  The lid is tight so not even a drop of serum will be wasted on a spill.  Just one pump of the anti-wrinkle serum covers a large area and about two pumps covers your whole face and neck.  The 1 fluid ounce bottle should last you for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good quality anti-aging facial serum, then you should get yourself some Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I really saw nothing, after 2 wks. of faithful usage. They give no directions, or ingredients, so to me I could have done better at the store!</li>
            <li> Works nicely to reduce wrinkles, smells alright. Product is easy to apply,non greasy or oily. It does take some time, and will only slightly improve already existing wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> I really, really love this serum. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but I&#x27;m active in preventing them. This serum feels so good on my skin and family members quickly wanted to try it because my skin was looking really fresh and said family member was really envious. It worked for her to ease a few laugh lines. Very impressed. The packaging is really pretty, too. Not that it matters, but I navigate towards pretty packages so I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;I received one for free in exchange for my honest review. I am only sharing my actual experience.</li>
            <li> I personally have had difficulty with resurfacing products due to sensitive skin. Alice Nouveau Hydrating Serum has been so wonderful, I actually look forward to washing my face at night just to put this on. It is a hydrating anti-wrinkle serum, soaks in in a few minutes. Don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer unless you&#x27;re really dry. Noticed improvement in pore size and skin smoothness softness.and fine wrinkles. Have only been using a few weeks and have seen a difference. Felt wonderful the night after my microderm. I take really good care of my skin. Great for sensitive skin, nice and dewy, you look refreshed in the morning! Thank you Alice Nouveau Hydrating Serum!!!</li>
            <li> My mom and aunt love this serum! I got it for them as a joking Christmas gift, turns out this product truly works, it lifts and tightens the skins, I notice the wrinkles and bags my mom use to have are definitely going away, along with my aunts as well. It also keeps the skin hydrated and smooth. Natural young looking skin is so easy to obtain now as long as you have Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum! :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m almost out of my 20&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;s time to start taking extra care of my skin, before I start to notice deep wrinkles, dark spots, and other signs of aging. I&#x27;ve developed a morning time skincare routine that helps keep my skin looking fresh all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;First, I start by cleansing, and 3x a week, I do a deep exfoliation as well. Once my skin is clean and my pores are clean, it&#x27;s serum time! I&#x27;ve tried  quite a few different serums over the past year or so, but my new, absolute favorite is this hydrating anti-wrinkle serum from Alice Nouveau! The very first thing that I noticed about this serum was the pretty, shiny packaging. I&#x27;m a packaging nerd, and I really love the way that this is designed. Everything is easy to read, and well laid-out. This serum is easier to use than a lot of other serums, thanks to the luxurious thickness of this serum combined with the easy-to-use pump that allows me to only pump as much as I want it to!&lt;br /&gt;This anti-wrinkle serum makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like a few others that I have tried. It also dries smoothly, without flaking at all. It&#x27;s great on its own, or with another moisturizer over the top of it, and when that&#x27;s all dry, I apply my makeup if i want to, and I&#x27;m good to go! This would make a great gift, as part of a skincare lineup for any woman in my life...though I would avoid giving any woman an anti-wrinkle serum alone...might be a bit offensive! Haha&lt;br /&gt;I received this hydrating anti-wrinkle serum for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after using for a few weeks, but for $35, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle.  What annoys me is how many of these reviews seem fake.  If you look at the people placing all this glowing reviews, the majority are ranting and raving and giving 5 stars to every product they ever reviewed....hmmm.  Shady!</li>
            <li> Week two I can see improvement in my skin, and feel confident to go with out makeup. Yes there are still wrinkles but there is improvement my skin is smoother and I have received compliments. I go out with no makeup.</li>
            <li> Received the product OK although it took some time to arrive.  I have no opinion of results as have only been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> This serum is a lightweight gel with a fresh clean scent. It only takes one pump to cover the areas where I use it each day. I use it at night after I have cleansed &amp; dried my face so that it can work while I sleep. I have somewhat sensitive combination skin but have not experienced any redness or irritation from using this serum &amp; it does not clog my pores. I use this mostly around my eyes, on my neck &amp; the backs of my hands. It absorbs quickly &amp; there is just a hint of the scent when it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now so it is too soon to see long-term results yet but my skin is much softer &amp; smoother since I’ve been using it. Since it doesn’t take much serum for each use, this 1 ounce pump bottle will last me for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my personal use of the product.</li>
            <li> Skin is definitely softer to the touch. It&#x27;s like a baby&#x27;s butt. Great product and I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Got this for fine lines appearing on my bald forehead and under my eyes.  After a month of use, I can honestly say, YES, it WORKS!  It takes some time, but 4 weeks later and those noticeable wrinkles and lines are no longer noticeable.  Use it regularly, as directed, and take care of your skin, and you too will see results.  I am happy with this purchase and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product for young, healthy looking skin! I use this at night before bed and it makes my skin feel really smooth and fresh when I wake up in the morning. My friends have told me that I look like I&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and I tell them it&#x27;s because of this product! Really nice to use as well, not oily at all.</li>
            <li> As I approach age 30,  I have been treating my skin better and looking for products to make my skin more moisturized and nourished.  This anti-wrinkle serum by Alice Nouveau is one of the best products I have tried.  I apply it and after a few weeks I have already seen the little lines on my forehead getting smaller and my face looking smoother and more youthful.  I recommend this product along with your favorite moisturizing cream and plenty of water for a perfect skin care regimen</li>
            <li> When I was very much unhappy with the wrinkles on my face, one of the friends suggested this serum. The serum is very great and it worked well for me. The wrinkles and fine lines started to vanish. I am very happy with the product and would recommend to everyone who are worried about the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks buddy for this wonderful recommendation. Looking forward to reuse it for complete clear skin!</li>
            <li> This anti wrinkle serum is amazing . I am 32 but a smoker and and often stay up late.I noticed fine lines around my eyes 1 year ago. I tried a few home remedies and I had no luck.One of my co workers recomended this product.Skeptical was putting it mildly of how I felt when ordering.I&#x27;ve been using it for 2and a half months now and I&#x27;m getting compliments daily.I look like I am 22 not 32.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter months, a problem that has only gotten worse with age. This serum does an amazing job softening my skin and getting rid of the red, flaky patches that I sometimes get. It also reduces the fine lines that I am starting to get on my forehead and around my eyes. An ounce of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure. If you are in your 20s or 30s, this is a great product to use in order to prevent those pesky little lines from turning into full blown wrinkles!</li>
            <li> ben using about 2 weeks now...not sure if it is to soon to tell but I think some of my eye wrinkles look not so deep.&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on very easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, wasn&#x27;t sure about it because I&#x27;d never heard of it, but bought it based on reviews. I noticed an improvement in some facial lines within days!</li>
            <li> I love this product it works amazingly for me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to notice a difference in the lines and wrinkles on my face, but I do notice the moisture and hydration has improved. I have been plagued with dry patches on certain parts of my face and have noticed this serum helps to provide much-needed moisture. This is a little heavy for daytime use, but I do like applying it at night. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> excellent product - great service from this vendor</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this serum, I keep thinking of those commercials that show these girls poking at their skin that&#x27;s all plump and immediately bounces back after they poke it.  That&#x27;s how my skin feels after using the Alice serum.  There&#x27;s a bit of sensitivity when I first apply it but after a minute or two, there&#x27;s a really nice smooth feel to my skin when I run my fingers lightly along it.  There&#x27;s no greasy feel - just nice, smooth skin.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I just love this anti-wrinkle serum. I came across this product while I was looking for something similar on Amazon and this product caught my attention. I have noticed results since using it for 2 weeks now and even my friends can feel a marked difference in my skin. I have also recommended my friends and family to buy one as the cost is so low and there are no side effects. Even my mom in India loves it and wants me to buy one for her. Try it and you will see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beauty products over the years. I am a little obsessed with having great skin, especially on my face. I have the normal smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. This product was so amazing. At first it made my skin so soft. Which is a huge plus in my book. After a few days, ny crow&#x27;s feet didn&#x27;t stand out as much.  Few more days, my smile lines have drastically decreased. I love it.</li>
            <li> As I have been getting older, I have noticed more and more wrinkles starting to appear on my face. My friends have started using various serums and creams so I figured that I should start doing so as well. They all recommended various brands but nothing seemed to work for me and from what I could tell nothing was really working for them either. I stumbled across this Alice Nouveau serum and saw all the amazing reviews so I though that I would give it a try. I am so glad that I did. I have noticed dramatic wrinkle reduction and even smoother, softer skin. I recommended this to all my friends who have had similar results so I know that it is not just me! Best of all, this serum will last such a long time so it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for about 1 month and truthfully haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to date.  I will continue to use and see if there&#x27;s any change.</li>
            <li> I like to take care of my skin and I encourage others to do so as well. I came across this serum and thought I&#x27;d try it out and my skin is more moisturized and smooth and I feel and look great. Use as directed and don&#x27;t get crazy with it. Great product that&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This serum has changed my skin. For the past several years stress and hormones had taken a toll on my skin. I have been suffering from redness,  and irritation around my nose, mouth and chin. I have spent hundreds of dollars on high-end cosmetics and multiple prescription cream, including steroids with no change in my skin until I tried this wonderful hydrating anti wrinkle serum. A friend gave me some of her serum, and after noticing how great my skin looked about a week later, I was very impressed, my skin was clearing up, irritation healed, reduced redness, and great hydration. I went and bought a bottle and continued to use on my skin I could not believe how beautiful my face looked my skin was totally clear!! This is seriously a miracle worker. So, worth buying! Since I have purchased, I have an whole new beauty routine and my skin is better for it. -- I recommend anyone to try this!</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple weeks, my skin is very smooth with no wrinkles. At first, I was a skeptic, but decided in the end to try it once and the results are now amazing! It is great for people that are starting to age. It is a must have for anyone who wants to look younger and confident.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product! I bought my mom the Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle for Christmas and she loves it! Ever since she started using it her skin has looked healthier and more vibrant. She looks years younger and is super confident in her own skin now. I love seeing my mom this happy.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother who is 51. She had started noticing some changes she didn&#x27;t like...and we tried a couple things and they didn&#x27;t help. But shortly after beginning this she started noticing a nice change in her face. Her skin is smoother and &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;  She&#x27;s very happy</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s, and I have always worshiped the sun and tanning beds. These factors are taking a toll on my face.  I asked for some &amp;#34;wrinkle cream&amp;#34; for Christmas and got Alice Nouveau serum.  Never heard of it before, but I was willing to try anything. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It indeed feels &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; as advertised.  Takes a moment to soak into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t even feel like I needed a moisturizer when I used it.  I noticed smoother skin immediately.  Over a period of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles too.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Around my eyes and mouth, I have always had a tired wrinkle look.  I started using Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum. I have noticed that my skin is becoming clearer.  I use it before breakfast and just before bedtime.  The serum does not smell.  And I am very happy and would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Vow this is an excellent product for making the skin to appear young, and healthy skin! I use this regularly during the night times before I go to bed for sleeping. This actually makes me to feel my skin very smooth and appear fresh whie I wake up. After continuous use of Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum, many of my friends have really commented on my skin and my appearnace that I look shiny and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and I actually never felt shy in confessing the reason behind this! I am feeling really nice in using this as it is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that will hydrate my skin without any harsh chemicals, and that will also soothe my skin at the same time. Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum does just that. It&#x27;s not harsh, and it has a soothing effect thanks to the natural ingredients like Green Tea, and Jojoba Oil. The serum has a gel texture, and absorbs quickly unto the skin. It has a natural fresh scent to it that I really like. I also have not experienced any breakouts from using Alice Nouveau.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels hydrated without a sticky feel to it. Plus after using Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum I also noticed that my skin feels really smooth. The bonus from using the Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum is that not only do I experience hydrated skin, my skin looks fresh too! Plus since it is infused with Retinol it also unclog pores, but because it is infused with Retinol I prefer to use the Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum at night. I love layering the serum, and by that I mean I apply one thin layer, and then a second layer on fresh clean skin before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love that my skin is hydrated and is soothed thanks to the Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum. I love that my skin feels softer, and my pores are minimized. I continue to use the Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum for continued results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sent for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a health kick since the new year and I decided to try and make my appearance better as well.  I live a very stressful life and you can definitely tell by just looking at me.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and I can already see some improvements.  The lines are disappearing before my eyes! Even my coworkers have noticed the changes.  This product is definitely a self esteem booster. I will continue to use it for many moons to come!</li>
            <li> This product really works! My wrinkles just disappear. I was a bit skeptical of this product before, but not I am a huge believer. 100% satisfied-- would recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream does everything it promises. I am loving the way I look! I look younger and less tired, and looking good makes me feel good too. There are a lot of very expensive creams out there that do not work half as well as this one. Believe me, I have tried them. Do yourself a favor and skip the more expensive products; this is a five star serum at the right price!</li>
            <li> Was starting to get some wrinkles and I shouldn&#x27;t be so I was looking for a kind of cream to help. Not a lot just a couple crow&#x27;s feet. There was so many on amazon I was overwhelmed. Based on the price and reviews I picked this one and glad I did was a good choice.</li>
            <li> Alice Nouveau Hydrating Anti-Wrinkle Serum is a superior anti-aging product! For anyone who is starting to show the signs of aging, this product starts working pretty fast. After a week of using this product, I have noticed some of my fine lines around my eyes have started to diminish. It is super easy to apply and seems to be a pretty quality product. It is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This Anti-Wrinkle Serum works wonderfully on my skin. I never like running out of this product, so I try to always have a backup. My skin looks and feels so smooth within minutes of using and the best part, it really does work on the deeper wrinkles! It is my number one skincare product that I just don&#x27;t want to live without. It&#x27;s not cheap but works good and fast, so much better than other products. One more plus, even getting it close to my eyes on occasion, never causes irritation! Great, just please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.</li>
