            <li>This is an okay cleanser.</li>
            <li>I recommend most of Alba products.</li>
            <li>I swear my skin glows more after using this about once a week.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My Hubby uses it and claims that is makes his skin feel better and it makes for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or oily, just perfect.</li>
            <li>I just use a pea sized amount and can comfortably scrub my face with this refreshing scented micro scrub.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite is that no animals were used in order for me to enjoy this product</li>
            <li>The scrub is smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, this is the most important.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels so clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different scrubs and find this one of the most pleasant ones.  </li>
            <li>I find that this product works well for me and helps me maintain a clear bright completion.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>, this scrub does the job gently and effectively.  </li>
            <li>Effective, but gentle exfoliant with clean ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love all the Even products and have been using the facewash, toner, and night cream for years - this was the first time I&#x27;d tried the mask.</li>
            <li>Having used this scrub for the past month, I have nothing but great things to say about it!</li>
            <li>Face feels refreshed and clean after use.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft with a nice dewy glow.</li>
            <li>I love that its all natural ingredients and it the fine sand in it, or whatever it is, doesn&#x27;t dissolve.</li>
            <li>love the all natural, cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; since I started using this one full tube ago.</li>
            <li>Love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only suggest a more sturdy cap so it won&#x27;t break as easily if it falls in the shower.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and the squeeze tube makes it easy to dispense and the cap fastens securely so there is no mess.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin, and it&#x27;s also oily with noticeable pores most of the time.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling completely refreshed, soft, and smooth, and it has become one of my favorite parts of the day to come home and use to &amp;#34;take the day off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Enzyme cleaning is great, but I think it should be used carefully and modestly, to avoid stressing the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great scrub for face - all natural &amp; not too rough on face</li>
            <li>Great price, it works just as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy and quick</li>
            <li>and I bought my first one 6 months ago and just bought another.</li>
            <li>I really like this face scrub!</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft...</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is the size of the particles: they&#x27;re not so big</li>
            <li>I see how clean and clear my face looks.</li>
            <li>I found the Alba Botanical scrub less effective since it was more creamy than exfoliant feeling on my skin and left dry patches where this Advanced scrub takes care of it all without feeling like sand paper and leaving my face bright pink.  </li>
            <li>feels good, natural, not too rough</li>
            <li>It seems hard to find products that are effective and also easier on the planet (and our bodies!)</li>
            <li>Very nice, not too rough, facial scrub.</li>
            <li>This is a great scrub which contains natural ingredients to gently exfoliate the dead layers of your skin.</li>
            <li>It also helps the white heads come off easily after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Alba facial scrub many times as it clears my pores of impurities, dead skin and leaves it smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Thought I would love this product beause it has &amp;#34;sea enzymes&amp;#34;- and I have a dead sea facial mask I love.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 years and really like it.</li>
            <li>I originally received this as a gift and have since bought a second tube and also gave one to a friend.</li>
            <li>It is not tested on animals which is the main reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars that have also been noticeably disappearing, though I also use the daily cream and night creams from the same line, so can&#x27;t say which products are working better than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not greasy, oily, smells good, cleans great, no plastic microbeads in it that are terrible for the lakes!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this scrub.</li>
            <li>I use it 2-3 times a week instead of my normal face wash.  </li>
            <li>The granules are just the right size (small) and evenly distributed, resulting in a gentle scrub that leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Feels much more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than other commercial masks.</li>
            <li>I like these product, but being organic and stuff, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel REALLY clean as other products with SLS do.</li>
            <li>I like the enzyme exfoliation so much better than products with walnut or apricot or walnut scrubbies that can scratch delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>still you need to scrub softly</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and am 35, so I need an exfoliant to avoid clogged pores.</li>
            <li>This does everything I need without over drying and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on skin</li>
            <li>I say micro scrub because the granules are quite fine without being too small.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re wondering how clean your skin is getting (like with St. Ives Apricot scrub), but not so small you can&#x27;t feel them.</li>
            <li>it left my skin soft and didn&#x27;t cause any breakout.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin, and live in a cold, dry climate most of the year!</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a little drying (which I was willing to accept to get rid of that oil!); but I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and no sign of dryness.  </li>

            <li> Works wonders for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Very minimal fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like it, I have been using the Giovanni system, and it&#x27;s very comparable, slightly less expensive, and the abrasive is biodegradable from what I can tell by the ingredient label.</li>
            <li> I used this scrub twice a week, the black heads are reducing.</li>
            <li> The odor is slight and inoffensive.  </li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s been using for a few years now; thought I&#x27;d try it myself.</li>
            <li> eventhough i used it everyday sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> Just need a small amount and rub for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean I should forego a weekly exfoliation to help freshen up my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather used this product, than using those stuff with parabens, sulfates, and other dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> this scrub makes my face feel so soft without the harshness of nasty chemicals.</li>

            <li> Love how this cleans my face without feeling like my skin is being scrubbed off.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash, very nice clean scent. I have the mask also which is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> This leaves my face smooth &amp; feeling great. Perfect for the start of a makeup application before moisturizer &amp; primer.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve always like Alba products, but I&#x27;m really impressed with this one.  I have mature skin, and it&#x27;s also oily with noticeable pores most of the time.  This smooths the skin wonderfully, and minimizes the pores.  I expected it to be a little drying (which I was willing to accept to get rid of that oil!); but I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and no sign of dryness.  It&#x27;s a good way to start the morning with fresh, exfoliated skin.  Enzyme cleaning is great, but I think it should be used carefully and modestly, to avoid stressing the skin.  I like the enzyme exfoliation so much better than products with walnut or apricot or walnut scrubbies that can scratch delicate skin.</li>
            <li> This scrub is excellent to use in cleaning and clearing pores of oil and blackhead and is also gentle.  I have purchased Alba facial scrub many times as it clears my pores of impurities, dead skin and leaves it smooth and clean.  Non-irritating and effective.</li>
            <li> great texture and smell!</li>
            <li> I love all the Even products and have been using the facewash, toner, and night cream for years - this was the first time I&#x27;d tried the mask. Does the job while smelling great and rinsing off easily. No irritation. Feels much more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than other commercial masks.</li>
            <li> Thought I would love this product beause it has &amp;#34;sea enzymes&amp;#34;- and I have a dead sea facial mask I love. Not so much. This scrub doesnt do the job I thought it would, and didnt leave my face any clearer. Find the Alba fruit scrub - works much better. Im sticking with that from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have sensitive dry skin, and live in a cold, dry climate most of the year! It is a great exfoliant!</li>
            <li> This is an okay cleanser. I don&#x27;t find the exfolients as effective as I had read, but it does a good job cleaning. I stopped using this product after this bottle, however.</li>
            <li> I like it, I have been using the Giovanni system, and it&#x27;s very comparable, slightly less expensive, and the abrasive is biodegradable from what I can tell by the ingredient label.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin but that doesn&#x27;t mean I should forego a weekly exfoliation to help freshen up my skin.  I just use a pea sized amount and can comfortably scrub my face with this refreshing scented micro scrub.  I say micro scrub because the granules are quite fine without being too small.  I found the Alba Botanical scrub less effective since it was more creamy than exfoliant feeling on my skin and left dry patches where this Advanced scrub takes care of it all without feeling like sand paper and leaving my face bright pink.  Love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only suggest a more sturdy cap so it won&#x27;t break as easily if it falls in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great scrub for face - all natural &amp; not too rough on face</li>
            <li> I brought it at a CVS in California and loved using it.  I use it every night to refresh my face and.&lt;br /&gt;since using it I see how clean and clear my face looks.</li>
            <li> feels good, natural, not too rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 years and really like it. I notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for a week.</li>
            <li> Effective, but gentle exfoliant with clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> Alba is my choice always. The scrub is smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, this is the most important. I used this scrub twice a week, the black heads are reducing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different scrubs and find this one of the most pleasant ones.  The granules are just the right size (small) and evenly distributed, resulting in a gentle scrub that leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.  The odor is slight and inoffensive.  I originally received this as a gift and have since bought a second tube and also gave one to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels so clean and exfoliated. Also seems to brighten after using. I recommend most of Alba products.</li>
            <li> love the all natural, cruelty free products. this scrub makes my face feel so soft without the harshness of nasty chemicals. it left my skin soft and didn&#x27;t cause any breakout. still you need to scrub softly or you can damage your skin with any scrub.</li>
            <li> Great price, it works just as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I find that this product works well for me and helps me maintain a clear bright completion. My teenage child also has taken to using this product and it has helped to curb acne and excema outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Very nice, not too rough, facial scrub. My mother&#x27;s been using for a few years now; thought I&#x27;d try it myself.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Clears and shrinks my pores, best part is its natural!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for over a year, what can I say - works wonders.</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub which contains natural ingredients to gently exfoliate the dead layers of your skin. I use this product 1x a week when giving myself a facial. I also use their mask. It leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft with a nice dewy glow. I have noticed that my acne scars have faded and that this product truly does even out your skintone. It&#x27;s a great product. This is the first product I bought from this line &amp; am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s great.  I use it 2-3 times a week instead of my normal face wash.  It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this face scrub! It seems hard to find products that are effective and also easier on the planet (and our bodies!) but this one is it. I have sensitive combination skin and am 35, so I need an exfoliant to avoid clogged pores. This does everything I need without over drying and is gentle enough to use every day. My skin looks fresh and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; since I started using this one full tube ago. I just bought a refill!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and so use this product every day. It makes my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Highly recommend this scrub.</li>
            <li> I swear my skin glows more after using this about once a week.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  My face feels smooth and soft...even my husband noticed! My favorite is that no animals were used in order for me to enjoy this product</li>
            <li> Having used this scrub for the past month, I have nothing but great things to say about it! My favorite thing is the size of the particles: they&#x27;re not so big you&#x27;re wondering how clean your skin is getting (like with St. Ives Apricot scrub), but not so small you can&#x27;t feel them. I have combination skin that flakes, and it does an exceptional job of exfoliating the areas that need it, as well as eliminating excess oil, but not over-drying drier spots. I have acne scars that have also been noticeably disappearing, though I also use the daily cream and night creams from the same line, so can&#x27;t say which products are working better than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: This is the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my skin feeling completely refreshed, soft, and smooth, and it has become one of my favorite parts of the day to come home and use to &amp;#34;take the day off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> great scrub. Not greasy, oily, smells good, cleans great, no plastic microbeads in it that are terrible for the lakes!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Simple, easy and quick, this scrub does the job gently and effectively.  I keep it in the shower and the squeeze tube makes it easy to dispense and the cap fastens securely so there is no mess.  But the Number 1 Recommendation is this:  My Hubby uses it and claims that is makes his skin feel better and it makes for a closer shave.  Enough said.......</li>
            <li> Great product. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> I love this. Not harsh on skin eventhough i used it everyday sometimes twice. It also helps the white heads come off easily after a shower. Plus its organic.</li>
