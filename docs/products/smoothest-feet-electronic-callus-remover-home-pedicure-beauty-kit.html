            <li>It comes in a nice box to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>I recommend using after you get out of a bath or soaking your feet in warm water before use.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a good product and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these and the first one was doa, but the seller took wonderful care of me and immediately sent me another one, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say it is beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best callus remover.</li>
            <li>My feet are now very smooth.  .</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and great results!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I Pulled the bottom from the handle and exposed the batteries once more.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>Love the smoothest  feet,only problem  need to  know  where  </li>
            <li>I got amazing results (smooth heels ever)</li>
            <li>have used this a couple more times.  </li>
            <li>I bought for my mom and she doesn&#x27;t use nail clipper any more.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this thing does it, but it works better than all of the tools I&#x27;ve ever had used on me at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Smooth like baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>And I love it</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great, fast results.</li>
            <li>This one had a pretty good &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; rating, so I gave it  shot.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it works amazingly!!</li>
            <li>Works well with a light touch, I imagine a plug in type will have more gumption, but this did the job with time.</li>
            <li>It got my daughter and my feet so smooth way better than the Ped Egg that I have.</li>
            <li>This does a really good job on feet and doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works wonders on your heels.</li>
            <li>Nearly every night I rub his feet with Cerave Moisture Cream (probably the best moisturizer ever created without the high price that goes hand in hand with advertising hype)</li>
            <li>This callus remover is easy to use and makes your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>It does a great job if you can finally get it started!</li>
            <li>Fortunately he did.  </li>
            <li>I just got an e-mail from the company that makes/sells this gadget, and I have updated my rating to FIVE STARS, because refills are now available at http://www.amazon.com/UTILYZE-Rollers-Electronic-CR-500B-Pedicure/dp/B00QMV6MCG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430095701&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;callus+remover+replacement+rollers and, by all appearances, the replacement rollers for http://www.amazon.com/CallusShaver-Replacement-Roller-Heads-3/dp/B00NOI5QTK/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;16CBK77W1XSG4PK6AGVT# may also fit this unit.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I found it to be comfortable to hold and handle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to smooth out my feet and boy</li>
            <li>However, it worked great and for the price I would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I found this very effective, after the very second use.</li>
            <li>It makes giving myself a pedicure so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive my callous remover</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and not painful at all - you just run it along your feet.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cleaner brush so clean up was a breeze.</li>
            <li>My heel feels a bit warm, even now, but it is most definitely smoother than it was before I figured out how to work the thing.</li>
            <li>I saw the positive reviews and decided to take a chance, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and will recommend it highly to anyone who has rough feet.</li>
            <li>Very efficient and smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite color by any means but who really cares what it looks like?</li>
            <li>Returned product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>it was a super deal</li>
            <li>Super smoothe feet</li>
            <li>My wife said it works pretty well!</li>
            <li>I simply just love it!</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, it doesn&#x27;t matter how well a product works fresh from the box.</li>
            <li>after two times using this powerful product.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and has just enough power to rid the feet of calluses without the burn of other products.</li>
            <li>Great little device at a super price ( at least when I bought it lol )  </li>
            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, but after you give it a minute and then feel your feet, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how smooth they are.</li>
            <li>Well...the Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover would be worthy of more stars if they actually made replacement heads for their product.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few days then just quit working all together!</li>
            <li>The buffing heads from this fit on the new one as a bonus.</li>
            <li>after she has used it for a few weeks, she has decided it is wonderful and asked me to purchase replacement heads for the future.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>OMG - I am currently callus free!</li>
            <li>Have used it several times and love it.  </li>
            <li>my feet are so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful and not apply a lot of pressure on the wheel; just take it easy and lightly move over the concerned areas.  </li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d product fast however, right out of the box it did not work.</li>
            <li>I know it will do more for my feet than for Mr. Scaleyfoot, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I can say that my feet is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>It looks very ache.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It does seem a bit cheaply made, struggled to get the battery door latched after putting them in, engineer hubby finally got it.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have normal people feet!</li>
            <li>Better than rubbing a stone or other device.</li>
            <li>I just needed something to help keep my feet smooth because a pumice stone takes too long.</li>
            <li>What this means is, that once the original buffer wheel is worn clean, and you have done the same with the single spare that comes packaged with your device, well, you are out of luck.</li>
            <li>I was little pleased</li>
            <li>You may have trouble getting the device started, make sure the contact points inside are</li>
            <li>Im thinking on buying a few more for birthday gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li>and she claims has made her feet baby smooth in just the first few days.</li>
            <li>could be better and last as long as a pedi have to do my feet within a week</li>
            <li>I grabbed a pair of regular AA&#x27;s and they popped right in.</li>
            <li>Used brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>We used a case of new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I inserted two new batteries it is still working after my 15 minute treatment</li>
            <li>given I live on an island in Alaska.</li>
            <li>It also comes with 2 &amp;#34;sand filers&amp;#34; and a little brush to clean in between uses!</li>
            <li>and once it did I was pretty pleased with how it worked despite the starting trouble !</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This winter I&#x27;ve developed super dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at smoothing out calluses and rough spots on your skin, can burn if you hold it in one spot for tooo long,  but that is expected considering this is just a mini grinder.  </li>
            <li>Works better when feet are completely dry and rough.</li>
            <li>Works very well, had a little trouble getting the batteries in exactly right before it would work but after that it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Its gentle and soft but at the same time it removes the toughest skin from your feet.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>So far, I think we may like it.</li>
            <li>Really like that is did come with a protective cover and extra wheels and at around a quarter of the cost of the amma ped thing at walmart</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft from using it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is that it wears out the batteries rather quickly and when the batteries run low, it stops spinning with the same force it starts with.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t easily make it to the salon within the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>What matters is how much use you will be ale t get from it...and in the case of this Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover, the answer is &amp;#34;not nearly as long as you would expect...</li>
            <li>Normally this isn&#x27;t a big deal, you just turn the thing over, remove the battery and proceed...</li>
            <li>I only ran the thing lightly on my one foot for a few minutes to see how it feels.</li>
            <li>this product is nice, however I wish the spinner was a lil  more powerful constantly buying batteries is annoying as well too bad it didn&#x27;t come with an electrical cord, but it does work you will have to use if a few times for better results after my first use</li>
            <li>This product worked very well in smoothing out my exceptionally rough calloused feet.</li>
            <li>If the current price comes down to that, I plan to buy a few more to gift.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries repositioning the batteries and even giving the unit a couple if taps to see if a possible loose contact would right itself.</li>
            <li>When I finally figured out how to open the battery compartment, and stuck the first battery in, I realized that I had stuck it in up side down.</li>

            <li> Great little device at a super price ( at least when I bought it lol )  </li>
            <li> At first it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, but after you give it a minute and then feel your feet, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how smooth they are.</li>
            <li> Well...the Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover would be worthy of more stars if they actually made replacement heads for their product.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few days then just quit working all together!</li>
            <li> The buffing heads from this fit on the new one as a bonus.</li>
            <li> after she has used it for a few weeks, she has decided it is wonderful and asked me to purchase replacement heads for the future.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> OMG - I am currently callus free!</li>
            <li> Have used it several times and love it.  </li>
            <li> my feet are so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and not apply a lot of pressure on the wheel; just take it easy and lightly move over the concerned areas.  </li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d product fast however, right out of the box it did not work.</li>
            <li> I know it will do more for my feet than for Mr. Scaleyfoot, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I can say that my feet is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> It looks very ache.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit cheaply made, struggled to get the battery door latched after putting them in, engineer hubby finally got it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have normal people feet!</li>
            <li> Better than rubbing a stone or other device.</li>
            <li> I just needed something to help keep my feet smooth because a pumice stone takes too long.</li>
            <li> What this means is, that once the original buffer wheel is worn clean, and you have done the same with the single spare that comes packaged with your device, well, you are out of luck.</li>
            <li> I was little pleased</li>
            <li> You may have trouble getting the device started, make sure the contact points inside are</li>
            <li> Im thinking on buying a few more for birthday gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> and she claims has made her feet baby smooth in just the first few days.</li>
            <li> could be better and last as long as a pedi have to do my feet within a week</li>
            <li> I grabbed a pair of regular AA&#x27;s and they popped right in.</li>
            <li> Used brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> We used a case of new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I inserted two new batteries it is still working after my 15 minute treatment</li>
            <li> given I live on an island in Alaska.</li>
            <li> It also comes with 2 &amp;#34;sand filers&amp;#34; and a little brush to clean in between uses!</li>
            <li> and once it did I was pretty pleased with how it worked despite the starting trouble !</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This winter I&#x27;ve developed super dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at smoothing out calluses and rough spots on your skin, can burn if you hold it in one spot for tooo long,  but that is expected considering this is just a mini grinder.  </li>
            <li> Works better when feet are completely dry and rough.</li>
            <li> Works very well, had a little trouble getting the batteries in exactly right before it would work but after that it was fine.  </li>
            <li> Its gentle and soft but at the same time it removes the toughest skin from your feet.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> So far, I think we may like it.</li>
            <li> Really like that is did come with a protective cover and extra wheels and at around a quarter of the cost of the amma ped thing at walmart</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft from using it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is that it wears out the batteries rather quickly and when the batteries run low, it stops spinning with the same force it starts with.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t easily make it to the salon within the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> What matters is how much use you will be ale t get from it...and in the case of this Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover, the answer is &amp;#34;not nearly as long as you would expect...</li>
            <li> Normally this isn&#x27;t a big deal, you just turn the thing over, remove the battery and proceed...</li>
            <li> I only ran the thing lightly on my one foot for a few minutes to see how it feels.</li>
            <li> this product is nice, however I wish the spinner was a lil  more powerful constantly buying batteries is annoying as well too bad it didn&#x27;t come with an electrical cord, but it does work you will have to use if a few times for better results after my first use</li>
            <li> This product worked very well in smoothing out my exceptionally rough calloused feet.</li>
            <li> If the current price comes down to that, I plan to buy a few more to gift.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries repositioning the batteries and even giving the unit a couple if taps to see if a possible loose contact would right itself.</li>
            <li> When I finally figured out how to open the battery compartment, and stuck the first battery in, I realized that I had stuck it in up side down.</li>
            <li> and I can’t, at this time, tell you how long they will last.  </li>
            <li> Pressing harder does not remove callus&#x27; any faster and can actually damage your skin.</li>
            <li> If you gently and slowly run this across the affected areas it does remove the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It came with an extra head (so someone else in family can use it or you have a spare, as they will wear down eventually).  </li>
            <li> Pressing down will bog the motor which is actually a safety feature.</li>
            <li> I felt the sale price made this affordable to try it to remove the rough dry skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Its a little gadget and his feet are a big task.</li>
            <li> Getting the batteries to work properly was a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> had trouble getting it to work, put batteries in 8 times, it finally worked</li>
            <li> I missed sending it back by a few days.</li>
            <li> this unit never worked, then I had to go through the trouble of sending it back to get a refund which takes forever</li>
            <li> This item performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use Energizer Rechargeable batteries and they did not fit properly into the handle.</li>
            <li> The grinding wheel worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Mine on the other hand, stops when pressure (not much by the way) is applied.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I usually get regular pedicures</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times and had to change the batteries, but remember I have very rough calloused feet.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so dry that the skin just flakes off causing little sores and cuts!</li>
            <li> We tried several sets of batteries to eliminate battery failure as a root cause.  </li>
            <li> My feet tend to form real hard calluses on the outside back edge, but this removes all of them within just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars as mom is particular and tough to please!</li>
            <li> a little  noisy</li>
            <li> There is also a little brush in the pack helps cleaning after.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm on my other half&#x27;s hard working feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from using pedicure files to file them down, to medicated lotions to help them from cracking and nothing has helped!</li>
            <li> It is similar, but looking at the drawing, and then looking at what is in your hand confused my brain.</li>
            <li> I suspect the folks that have issues with these types of devices is because they are impatient and are inclined to lean into it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, It&#x27;s so bad that I have to vacuum in front of his chair nearly every day because he sits watching TV and picking pieces of dried skin off his feet.</li>
            <li> When our newest toy got here, we were anxious to try it, so I opened the box and read the directions, which basically do not tell you a darned thing about how to use it.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try it</li>
            <li> I never write product reviews however this is the first time that I have been disappointed by a product I ordered online.  </li>
            <li> The $40 one that is all over TV is a ridiculous price in my opinion, for something that I&#x27;ll use a few times per year.  </li>
            <li> If you press it hard to your foot, as  some of the reviews state, it will stop the roller from revolving.  </li>
            <li> but I was required to assign at least one.  </li>
            <li> (I had some really thick callus/skin.)  </li>
            <li> No more scrubbing!</li>
            <li> No more sore arms!</li>
            <li> You have to force and push the batteries in and taking them out was next to impossible ...</li>
            <li> It has always been a painful constant battle.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and useless..</li>
            <li> First let me say I have the WORST feet a girl can have!</li>
            <li> As I was saying, I rub his feet and they are still dry, rough flaky and horrible.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the item ,doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong.</li>
            <li> and that is sad.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical whether this Electronic Callus remover would meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Its un expensive and by using it just once, it saved me 30 dollars on a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment design is very poor...</li>
            <li> I am particularly crazy about the shape my feet are in.</li>
            <li> I am comepletly shocked with my results!</li>
            <li> Ask anyone in my family and they will tell you my feet are nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> had trouble getting it to work, put batteries in 8 times, it finally worked</li>
            <li> Nice product. I find it works well.</li>
            <li> You may have trouble getting the device started, make sure the contact points inside are lifted.&lt;br /&gt;You get an extra roller, which is a bonus for the price that it is sold for.</li>
            <li> It does a great job if you can finally get it started! The battery compartment design is very poor... You have to force and push the batteries in and taking them out was next to impossible ... It took me a couple of tries repositioning the batteries and even giving the unit a couple if taps to see if a possible loose contact would right itself. Finally it started working and once it did I was pretty pleased with how it worked despite the starting trouble !</li>
            <li> Great product - very effectively remove callus. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It does a great job, lots of power</li>
            <li> Wow! This worked like a charm on my other half&#x27;s hard working feet. Simple to use and great results!! It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  When you put it on your heel the roller stops moving.  Used brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> I love this!! Living at the beach I am particularly crazy about the shape my feet are in. As soon as this arrived I ripped into and started using it. First, let me say it is beautifully packaged. Secondly, it works amazingly!! It does what it is supposed to. It smoothed my feet. They look and feel great! It comes with a cleaner brush so clean up was a breeze. I would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to share my review about this!!! First let me say I have the WORST feet a girl can have! Ask anyone in my family and they will tell you my feet are nasty. It has always been a painful constant battle. My feet are always cracking and splitting open and even bleed! They&#x27;re so dry that the skin just flakes off causing little sores and cuts! I&#x27;ve tried everything from using pedicure files to file them down, to medicated lotions to help them from cracking and nothing has helped! I am comepletly shocked with my results! I feel like I have normal people feet! They&#x27;re so smooth!  Now let me tell you about the product it&#x27;s self. It comes in a nice box to keep everything together. It also comes with 2 &amp;#34;sand filers&amp;#34; and a little brush to clean in between uses! I didn&#x27;t think the sandpaper files would even stand up to my feet but it did! So glad I got this! *purchased with a promotional discount*</li>
            <li> Wow.  Didn&#x27;t think this would work. Was I ever wrong. Smoothest feet in town.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal:  My husband has the driest, flakiest feet ever! Honestly, It&#x27;s so bad that I have to vacuum in front of his chair nearly every day because he sits watching TV and picking pieces of dried skin off his feet. Gross, isn&#x27;t it?  ANYWAY...Nearly every night I rub his feet with Cerave Moisture Cream (probably the best moisturizer ever created without the high price that goes hand in hand with advertising hype)....As I was saying, I rub his feet and they are still dry, rough flaky and horrible. I bought this thing after seeing an advertisement on TV for another brand that is much more expensive than this one is. This one had a pretty good &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; rating, so I gave it  shot. When our newest toy got here, we were anxious to try it, so I opened the box and read the directions, which basically do not tell you a darned thing about how to use it. The simple act of installing batteries took both of us to accomplish.  The &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; show a diagram of a product that is not what you are holding in your hand. It is similar, but looking at the drawing, and then looking at what is in your hand confused my brain. When I finally figured out how to open the battery compartment, and stuck the first battery in, I realized that I had stuck it in up side down. Normally this isn&#x27;t a big deal, you just turn the thing over, remove the battery and proceed...Not with this thing. It took hold of the battery and it did not want to give it back.  I finally handed it to my husband and asked him if he had the finger strength required to remove the battery. Fortunately he did.  I corrected the battery situation, installed two batteries and put the cover back on to the bottom of the gizmo handle, flipped the switch and.....Nothing.  I Pulled the bottom from the handle and exposed the batteries once more. This time I gave them a rather forceful push into the battery compartment, and replaced the cover...IT WORKED! I only ran the thing lightly on my one foot for a few minutes to see how it feels. It tickles. and it burns a bit too. My heel feels a bit warm, even now, but it is most definitely smoother than it was before I figured out how to work the thing. So far, I think we may like it. I know it will do more for my feet than for Mr. Scaleyfoot, but that is to be expected.  Its a little gadget and his feet are a big task. I am not expecting miracles, just hopefully fewer scales left on the floor. SO why only three stars, you may ask...Well...the Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover would be worthy of more stars if they actually made replacement heads for their product. They don&#x27;t. I wrote to the company and asked. What I was told is that there are no replacement rollers for this product, but they are &amp;#34;working on it&amp;#34;.  What this means is, that once the original buffer wheel is worn clean, and you have done the same with the single spare that comes packaged with your device, well, you are out of luck. Bottom line is, it doesn&#x27;t matter how well a product works fresh from the box. What matters is how much use you will be ale t get from it...and in the case of this Smoothest Feet Electronic Callus Remover, the answer is &amp;#34;not nearly as long as you would expect...This gadget has five star potential, with one star projected serviceability....and that is sad.  4/28/2014 UPDATE I just got an e-mail from the company that makes/sells this gadget, and I have updated my rating to FIVE STARS, because refills are now available at http://www.amazon.com/UTILYZE-Rollers-Electronic-CR-500B-Pedicure/dp/B00QMV6MCG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430095701&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;callus+remover+replacement+rollers and, by all appearances, the replacement rollers for http://www.amazon.com/CallusShaver-Replacement-Roller-Heads-3/dp/B00NOI5QTK/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;16CBK77W1XSG4PK6AGVT# may also fit this unit.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job on feet and doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical whether this Electronic Callus remover would meet my expectations and it sure did! Once arrived I inserted the batteries and immediately started to remove the built up callus on my heel. Very efficient and smooth! Better than rubbing a stone or other device. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great little device at a super price ( at least when I bought it lol )  a little  noisy ( so my wife says, I don&#x27;t think so ) It does a good job at smoothing out calluses and rough spots on your skin, can burn if you hold it in one spot for tooo long,  but that is expected considering this is just a mini grinder.  Really like that is did come with a protective cover and extra wheels and at around a quarter of the cost of the amma ped thing at walmart it was a super deal</li>
            <li> good price and works well</li>
            <li> this utem does not work how can I get hekp with it?</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few days then just quit working all together!</li>
            <li> Trash trash trash trash. Read the one star reviews and not the paid 5 stars bogus. I bought this it does not even turn on. I swear to God I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my sister and she loved it. Will order one for myself soon.</li>
            <li> I really love this. Now I can throw away all my manual tools! It works wonderfully and has just enough power to rid the feet of calluses without the burn of other products. I would recommend to anyone needing help!</li>
            <li> This product does not work as stated. It stops on the slightest pressure and does not remove the callus from the foot.</li>
            <li> I found this very effective, after the very second use. Now, I use this once a week or once in 2 weeks and I can say that my feet is much smoother than before. I bought in Feb&#x27;15 for $11.99. If the current price comes down to that, I plan to buy a few more to gift.</li>
            <li> I cannot even give it one star but I was required to assign at least one.  It did not work at all upon arrival.  We scrupulously followed the instructions.  We used a case of new batteries.  We tried several sets of batteries to eliminate battery failure as a root cause.  This product is a dud.  And I don&#x27;t even know how to return it because I threw away the box it came in- never thinking it would not work at all.</li>
            <li> Getting the batteries to work properly was a little tricky.  Just don&#x27;t push the batteries in all the way. After that, it worked great and I use it about once a week.  I also bought one for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothest  feet,only problem  need to  know  where  to  get  replacement  heads. Does a fantastic  job.very impressed  with  it</li>
            <li> This callas remover does a great job</li>
            <li> This product worked very well in smoothing out my exceptionally rough calloused feet. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is that it wears out the batteries rather quickly and when the batteries run low, it stops spinning with the same force it starts with. I used it 2 times and had to change the batteries, but remember I have very rough calloused feet. Overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great item works great</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Easy to use and great, fast results.</li>
            <li> I got amazing results (smooth heels ever) after two times using this powerful product. There is also a little brush in the pack helps cleaning after. I am very happy with the product and will recommend it highly to anyone who has rough feet.</li>
            <li> After doing my research on Electronic Callus Removers I was a bit skeptical.  When your sale came across my computer I felt the sale price made this affordable to try it to remove the rough dry skin on my feet.  The item arrived a day later than I anticipated but with the snowy winter weather we are experiencing in MA it was understandable.  I was anxious to try it and this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works if you are patient.  If you gently and slowly run this across the affected areas it does remove the dry skin.  If you press it hard to your foot, as  some of the reviews state, it will stop the roller from revolving.  I found it to be comfortable to hold and handle.  I used this for about 15 minutes on my heels and it did show some progress.  I inserted two new batteries it is still working after my 15 minute treatment and I can’t, at this time, tell you how long they will last.  I think if I have another treatment or two my feet will be sandal-ready for the coming summer.  As I don’t have any callouses I cannot comment on how this item would perform in this arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a couple more times.  After the treatment I do apply a foot cream to my feet and find they are greatly improved.  I am happy I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> My mother suffer in callus. She cut callus with knife or nail clipper. It looks very ache. I bought for my mom and she doesn&#x27;t use nail clipper any more. It is easy to use, very good quality and good working. I am happy to bought it.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I was looking for. I think I will never have to go back to make a pedicure ever. I will save hundreds of dollars. Its gentle and soft but at the same time it removes the toughest skin from your feet. Its very easy to assemble, and delightful to use. Im in love with this product. Im thinking on buying a few more for birthday gifts for my friends. Its un expensive and by using it just once, it saved me 30 dollars on a pedicure. I will give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Had a problem with the batteries but after I got them in it worked great.</li>
            <li> OMG - I am currently callus free! Works well with a light touch, I imagine a plug in type will have more gumption, but this did the job with time. (I had some really thick callus/skin.)  I would get it again</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my needs. I just needed something to help keep my feet smooth because a pumice stone takes too long. This works well and has enough power for what I need it to do. Can&#x27;t wait for sandal season!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how much I love this thing! I saw the positive reviews and decided to take a chance, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. This winter I&#x27;ve developed super dry, cracked feet. I usually get regular pedicures but I just injured my knee skiing so I can&#x27;t easily make it to the salon within the next few weeks. I bought this to smooth out my feet and boy did it do the job! It&#x27;s super easy to use and not painful at all - you just run it along your feet. At first it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, but after you give it a minute and then feel your feet, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how smooth they are. I don&#x27;t know how this thing does it, but it works better than all of the tools I&#x27;ve ever had used on me at the nail salon. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I never write product reviews however this is the first time that I have been disappointed by a product I ordered online.  I was extremely excited to receive my callous remover but once I placed the batteries it did not work.</li>
            <li> when trying to use on callouses the wheel would stop turning the minute I applied any pressure to my callous.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good product and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> works great !! I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and after she has used it for a few weeks, she has decided it is wonderful and asked me to purchase replacement heads for the future. 5 stars as mom is particular and tough to please! Great product and she claims has made her feet baby smooth in just the first few days.</li>
            <li> could be better and last as long as a pedi have to do my feet within a week a pedi last me 3/4 weeks</li>
            <li> My wife said it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> Removing Callus can never been any easier than this! No more scrubbing! No more sore arms! And it does a great job on my heels! Smooth like baby&#x27;s! I simply just love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Super smoothe feet</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes giving myself a pedicure so quick and easy. I only wish I had found a product like this sooner!</li>
            <li> this product is nice, however I wish the spinner was a lil  more powerful constantly buying batteries is annoying as well too bad it didn&#x27;t come with an electrical cord, but it does work you will have to use if a few times for better results after my first use I was little pleased</li>
            <li> DOA, returned for refund</li>
            <li> It works once but then.......nothing..ugh,!!</li>
            <li> This callus remover is easy to use and makes your feet smooth. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these and the first one was doa, but the seller took wonderful care of me and immediately sent me another one, and it works fine.  My feet tend to form real hard calluses on the outside back edge, but this removes all of them within just a few minutes.  You have to be careful and not apply a lot of pressure on the wheel; just take it easy and lightly move over the concerned areas.  Be patient and it will do the job.  I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review/opinion.</li>
            <li> Works better when feet are completely dry and rough. Does not work so well when moist.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! My feet are so soft from using it. I recommend using after you get out of a bath or soaking your feet in warm water before use.</li>
            <li> I got a reduced price of ~$11 on this.  It does seem a bit cheaply made, struggled to get the battery door latched after putting them in, engineer hubby finally got it.  However, it worked great and for the price I would definitely buy it again.  The $40 one that is all over TV is a ridiculous price in my opinion, for something that I&#x27;ll use a few times per year.  It came with an extra head (so someone else in family can use it or you have a spare, as they will wear down eventually).  The packaging was great and will be great to store the unit it to keep it from damage between uses.  It&#x27;s not my favorite color by any means but who really cares what it looks like?</li>
            <li> Not happy with the item ,doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I love this callus remover! It got my daughter and my feet so smooth way better than the Ped Egg that I have. I have to buy some replacements now. I can&#x27;t be without this!</li>
            <li> My husband gave me this as a gift.. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t turn on. I missed sending it back by a few days. I sent a request to amazon and never heard back. I wouldn&#x27;t buy one again. Seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my GF she says it works great</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use.  Got a refund from Amazon and bought the Care me rechargeable CM-201 instead.  Have used it several times and love it.  The buffing heads from this fit on the new one as a bonus.</li>
            <li> Works very well, had a little trouble getting the batteries in exactly right before it would work but after that it was fine.  My feet are now very smooth.  .</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail today. And I love it my feet are so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is by far one of the best callus remover. It is easy to use and works wonders on your heels.</li>
            <li> My moms works great !  Mine on the other hand, stops when pressure (not much by the way) is applied.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and useless.. this unit never worked, then I had to go through the trouble of sending it back to get a refund which takes forever given I live on an island in Alaska.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d product fast however, right out of the box it did not work. I tried every which way to put the batteries in still would not work. Returned product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> This item performs as expected. I attempted to use Energizer Rechargeable batteries and they did not fit properly into the handle. The battery space would not accommodate the extra wrap on the battery. I grabbed a pair of regular AA&#x27;s and they popped right in. The grinding wheel worked as expected. The key is to not put extra pressure on the device, just let time and the grinder do the work. Pressing down will bog the motor which is actually a safety feature. Pressing harder does not remove callus&#x27; any faster and can actually damage your skin. I suspect the folks that have issues with these types of devices is because they are impatient and are inclined to lean into it.</li>
