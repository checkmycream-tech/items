            <li>My idea of a perfect pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure !</li>

            <li>Super cute as a pedi color.</li>

            <li>If you like bright pink, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I like the color, but it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like.</li>
            <li>Also, product arrived on time and wrapped securely.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant on purchasing this light nail polish online.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is available.  </li>
            <li>Definitely needs 2-3 coats to avoid streaks but great shade</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of bright, but not exactly neon.</li>
            <li>It does take 3 coats but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>this pink is great.</li>
            <li>Great pink for any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very feminine love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only gorgeous</li>
            <li>Full coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and amazingly fast arrival!!</li>
            <li>I received my shipment fast and the color isn&#x27;t too watery like some of the light pinks.</li>
            <li>Get this color for a gorgeous feminine yet barbie doll pink.</li>
            <li>This color is so beautiful, it last in your nails for a really long time.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite light pink!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still so pretty.</li>
            <li>, it stays on well, and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I would suggest this color if you are looking for a nice baby pink.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>TOP COAT NECESSARY.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>The color looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>And while it was pretty, it was not the color I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Such a great color pink.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t add the top coat, it would dry</li>
            <li>It is much lighter.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t glob so much nail polish on at once.</li>
            <li>Definitely in my top 3 pink nail polish shades.</li>
            <li>and I love pink.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too light and would require multiple layers.</li>
            <li>I love this shade of pink.</li>
            <li>It was also a much lighter color.</li>
            <li>Kind of streaky even after a few coats,</li>
            <li>It now my favorite pink!</li>
            <li>Its more of a highlighter pink than shown in the picture, but I still like it!</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my fav nail polishes right now!</li>
            <li>Overall an okay product , I would recommend only if you are dying to have this color on your nails.  </li>
            <li>Proved me wrong, it only takes one coat and looks awesome!</li>
            <li>but I was trying to find an older color that did wear well.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, didn&#x27;t wear it yet, but will soon certainly in association with white dots ...</li>
            <li>Its not a pale pink but its a pretty true to the picture.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a complimentary product.&lt;br /&gt;Gwen....</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t subtle, that&#x27;s for sure, but it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Actual color now as pink as pictured more neutral</li>
            <li>This is a solid Pink by Micki Minaj,it is the bright pink nail polish to wait for.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER,  It took me three coats for it to look smooth as it was a bit streaky, and is a super thin polish.</li>
            <li>The polish was old like they put nail polish remover in it to make it thinner.</li>
            <li>I knew you couldn&#x27;t get this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Pink Friday is the perfect pink and is opaque in two thin coats.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink.</li>
            <li>The actual color is a light, almost white pink.  </li>
            <li>This is not the color I ordered I was a little upset, but I love pink</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send it back because it only cost me 6 dollars and it might cost that much to return it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of when nail technicians put acetone in a bottle of nail polish that has gotten thick and clumpy to loosen it so that it will go on the nails easy.</li>
            <li>The product that was sent to me was not the real Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.</li>
            <li>No where near the same same color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but too bright for my dark skin and looks a little weird on me.</li>
            <li>this nail polish really seems like it had been watered down,  as if they poured nail polish remover in it</li>

            <li> HOWEVER,  It took me three coats for it to look smooth as it was a bit streaky, and is a super thin polish.</li>
            <li> The polish was old like they put nail polish remover in it to make it thinner.</li>
            <li> I knew you couldn&#x27;t get this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pink Friday is the perfect pink and is opaque in two thin coats.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink.</li>
            <li> The actual color is a light, almost white pink.  </li>
            <li> This is not the color I ordered I was a little upset, but I love pink</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t send it back because it only cost me 6 dollars and it might cost that much to return it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of when nail technicians put acetone in a bottle of nail polish that has gotten thick and clumpy to loosen it so that it will go on the nails easy.</li>
            <li> The product that was sent to me was not the real Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.</li>
            <li> No where near the same same color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but too bright for my dark skin and looks a little weird on me.</li>
            <li> this nail polish really seems like it had been watered down,  as if they poured nail polish remover in it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pink similar to MAC&#x27;s Sr. Germaine but didn&#x27;t want to pay that price for a nail polish.</li>
            <li> Is pink Friday the same color in the picture?  </li>
            <li> I receive compliments all day long!!</li>
            <li> bet pink i ever brought for my gf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li> I had the pink Friday from&lt;br /&gt;Before and it was almost done</li>
            <li> color was not what i expected the picture has the color darker than what it was when i got it in person</li>
            <li> It looks about like the color in the picture, and opaque bubble gum pink, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this shade of pink all my life.</li>
            <li> I have another bottle of Pink Friday that I compared it to.</li>
            <li> Pink Friday reminds me of the pink that Barbie items sometimes are but a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it</li>
            <li> Pink Friday is!</li>
            <li> Love the color but disappointed over all</li>
            <li> cant wait to get the other collection from nickie..</li>
            <li> The color is very pink.</li>
            <li> I only needed one coat, it seems really thick.</li>
            <li> Because what I got in the mail is a pale pink.</li>
            <li> It was watered down somehow.</li>
            <li> It seemed watered down and had to put about three coats just to get the color indicated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The prettiest pink ever!!</li>
            <li> It was a little bit lighter than the picture when I did 2 coats</li>
            <li> Too pink for me!!!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a stretchy texture, hard to explain.</li>
            <li> is not a good use of my time.</li>
            <li> Polish was thin, but did 2 coats</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Lasts long without base coat.</li>
            <li> but what arrived was a fake.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad batch</li>
            <li> It is a bit watery but it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t b disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of the thickness of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Now I will try with opi base coat plus Sally Hansen anti chip too coat</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking for a pink similar to MAC&#x27;s Sr. Germaine but didn&#x27;t want to pay that price for a nail polish. So glad I found this one from OPI! It now my favorite pink!</li>
            <li> I love this color in the bottle but it needs way too many coats on the nails.</li>
            <li> This color is so beautiful, it last in your nails for a really long time. This is one of my favorite pinks by opi.</li>
            <li> This does not look like the picture. Don&#x27;t like it at all. It is much lighter.</li>

            <li> I love the color very much its the perfect shade of pink. OPI has the best quality of Nail Polish it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The polish was old like they put nail polish remover in it to make it thinner. The color looked washed out. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy from this place again.</li>
            <li> I love this color its bright and perfect for ï»¿the summer.... this my favorite from my collection you won&#x27;t b disappointed</li>
            <li> this pink is great. it&#x27;s kind of bright, but not exactly neon. it isn&#x27;t subtle, that&#x27;s for sure, but it is really pretty.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the correct color. I had the pink Friday from&lt;br /&gt;Before and it was almost done so I wanted to purchase another but what arrived was a fake. No where near the same same color</li>
            <li> color was not what i expected the picture has the color darker than what it was when i got it in person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sheila h</li>
            <li> You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Another thing my niece talked me into to buying for her.</li>
            <li> OPI &amp;#34;Pink Friday&amp;#34; is bomb!! I receive compliments all day long!! I ordered 3 bottles and I will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Looks lovely on ALL skin tones. From very fair skin to very deep skin. I am in love with this color.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color!!! I won&#x27;t wear anything else!!! I get complimented on it daily!!! Shipping was ok... But free!!!</li>
            <li> Very feminine love this color, perfect for the summer. I recommend this color.</li>
            <li> Such a great color pink. It was a little bit lighter than the picture when I did 2 coats but it&#x27;s still so pretty.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s pretty, but too bright for my dark skin and looks a little weird on me. This was incredibly hyped and many others like it, so it may work for you.</li>
            <li> All the polishes are great love the colors too , will order more should I ever need too ! I will be looking to buy more I&#x27;m pretty sure !</li>
            <li> Great pink for any skin tone. Super cute as a pedi color. The color in the picture is spot on for the color in the bottle and on your nails.</li>
            <li> The prettiest pink ever!!</li>
            <li> It looks about like the color in the picture, and opaque bubble gum pink, which is what I wanted. I only needed one coat, it seems really thick. I wish the brush inside the bottle was smaller and thinner so it wouldn&#x27;t glob so much nail polish on at once. Other than that, I like it, it stays on well, and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> this nail polish really seems like it had been watered down,  as if they poured nail polish remover in it</li>
            <li> I like the color, but it doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like. I had to use several coats to get the look that I wanted. It also chipped very quickly. Maybe I received a bad batch</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is lighter than it looks in this photo... but is the perfect spring color:) :)</li>
            <li> The color is very pink. Look&#x27;s a lot like pepto-bismal in person. It&#x27;s pretty but it&#x27;s more for preteens.</li>
            <li> Kind of streaky even after a few coats, but i love the color. Its not a pale pink but its a pretty true to the picture.</li>
            <li> The item shipped alone but took forever to arrive, actually forgot I ordered it. The color is pretty &amp; excellent for Spring/Summer</li>
            <li> This is a solid Pink by Micki Minaj,it is the bright pink nail polish to wait for.Amazon is the site to go to.To be able to give you the colors you desire.They come through with flying colors.I seen this an I knew you couldn&#x27;t get this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Polish was thin, but did 2 coats and I love it! Its more of a highlighter pink than shown in the picture, but I still like it!</li>
            <li> This is not the color I ordered I was a little upset, but I love pink so I can deal with it.plus I don&#x27;t have time for all that return stuff.</li>
            <li> Definitely in my top 3 pink nail polish shades. Great color for the spring &amp; summer seasons to bring out any outfit.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments every time I wear this color. It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Pastel color, Like the photo. I like it very much, didn&#x27;t wear it yet, but will soon certainly in association with white dots ...</li>
            <li> I love Nicki Minaj and I love pink. I wear this color all the time and I never get tired of it. OPI is a great brand and this color is amazing. Buy it and buy it now.!!!</li>
            <li> Not as the picture shows</li>
            <li> I ordered all of the nicki minaj nailpolished after purchasing save me at my tanning salon a while back.  i love the colors because they are so bright and creamy!  Pink Friday is the perfect pink and is opaque in two thin coats.  I would suggest this color if you are looking for a nice baby pink.  Also, product arrived on time and wrapped securely.</li>
            <li> This is so my color every lady should have it. I get so many people telling me what a beautiful color Pink Friday is! If you don&#x27;t have it...... You better get it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooches</li>
            <li> Pretty color. Lasts long without base coat. Now I will try with opi base coat plus Sally Hansen anti chip too coat</li>
            <li> This product matches my Lime Crime Lipstick perfectly.  It goes on very nicely.  I use only two coats.  I will constantly buy this product.  Please keep this one in stock.  Thank you for such a complimentary product.&lt;br /&gt;Gwen....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color, and doesn&#x27;t chip that quickly  HOWEVER,  It took me three coats for it to look smooth as it was a bit streaky, and is a super thin polish. I also added a top protective/clear coat.  If I didn&#x27;t add the top coat, it would dry but you&#x27;d be able to pull it off your nail... it&#x27;s a stretchy texture, hard to explain. Summarized : TOP COAT NECESSARY.  It arrived quickly. Overall an okay product , I would recommend only if you are dying to have this color on your nails.  I&#x27;ve had this for months btw</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on purchasing this light nail polish online. I was worried it would be too light and would require multiple layers. Proved me wrong, it only takes one coat and looks awesome! Definitely one of my fav nail polishes right now! OPI is the only nail polish I will buy.</li>
            <li> i have already bought 2 of these. i love the color. i apply a matte top coat and its PERFECT for me...looks like the barbie pink i was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a playful pink&lt;br /&gt;color reminds me of Double Bubble - Bubble gum&lt;br /&gt;Good Spring and Summer color :)</li>
            <li> The reviews I read were correct that it is not long-lasting but I was trying to find an older color that did wear well.  This is not it and I don&#x27;t think it is available.  I love the color, but 1-2 days before it starts wearing off the tips is not a good use of my time.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. lovely colour!!</li>
            <li> I love the color  and the way the polish looks on my fingers, its a great fit!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommand the color for all seasons.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this shade of pink all my life. Good price for OPI, which is an excellent brand.</li>
            <li> I love this shade of pink. The price is good. I received my shipment fast and the color isn&#x27;t too watery like some of the light pinks. Two coats work for me. I&#x27;ve been wearing this color every day!! :)  I order another bottle for my sister. Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> It is a bit watery but it is not that bad. The color looks exactly as advertised. The shipping speed is good as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!!!!!! Just the color i thought it was going to be. great quaility. and amazingly fast arrival!! i was thrilled when i ordered this item and i was even more excited when i recieved it!! way cheaper than in the stores!!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s not only gorgeous but it looks great on almost any skin tone. Get this color for a gorgeous feminine yet barbie doll pink.</li>
            <li> Amor LOVE this everyone complements me xoxo</li>
            <li> Is pink Friday the same color in the picture?  Because what I got in the mail is a pale pink.</li>
            <li> The product that was sent to me was not the real Nicki Minaj Pink Friday. It was watered down somehow. It reminds me of when nail technicians put acetone in a bottle of nail polish that has gotten thick and clumpy to loosen it so that it will go on the nails easy. It was also a much lighter color. I have another bottle of Pink Friday that I compared it to. Pink Friday reminds me of the pink that Barbie items sometimes are but a shade lighter. I didn&#x27;t send it back because it only cost me 6 dollars and it might cost that much to return it. I will never order nail polish online after this situation.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of the thickness of the nail polish. It seemed watered down and had to put about three coats just to get the color indicated on the bottle. Love the color but disappointed over all</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color for summer..It look just like the pic and I will definitely be purchasing this color again.</li>
            <li> I love it. This product is GREAT. Will be ordering soon to get more. Opi is the only product that last longer on your naiks.</li>
            <li> Too pink for me!!!!  If you like bright pink, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful, if you like light colors then this is for you also. I got it thinking it would go with everything and it does and it takes two coats and a top coat and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Must have pink in your collection or great gift for your manicurist or polish loving friend!!</li>
            <li> I like Opi but this color portrayed is not indicative of what you actually get.  The actual color is a light, almost white pink.  And while it was pretty, it was not the color I was expecting.  However, I turned it over to my daughter who is thrilled with it so it has all evened out.  Opi makes wonderful nail polish.  I think in this circumstance the picture needs to reflect the actual color.</li>
            <li> Best color. Perfect shade of pink. Full coverage in two coats. Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. GREAT price. Must have!!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite light pink! It does take 3 coats but it is so worth it! If you love the pink Nicki Minaj wears, then this is the perfect color for you!</li>
            <li> Actual color now as pink as pictured more neutral</li>
            <li> My idea of a perfect pink. Definitely needs 2-3 coats to avoid streaks but great shade</li>
            <li> Loved this Color and it was very well packaged!!</li>
            <li> Favorite color! Great summer color..</li>
            <li> This polish is great , the color is better than it looks online...I love this polish cant wait to get the other collection from nickie..</li>
