            <li>I am very dissatisfied.</li>

            <li>I really like this perfume and the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am very absent .</li>
            <li>I expected more from Gucci.</li>
            <li>She smelt a sample of this and other Gucci scents and fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavier and headier than a true floral making it truly unique in my collection.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I love perfume and wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>But, if you like The One you should try or at least test this fragrance against your own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh, feminine, and current.  </li>
            <li>It was the exact same product.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased Givenchy&#x27;s Very Irresistible and along with the Premiere, I have my two distinctly different fragrances for the winter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this exact item in Rome, Italy and it was more expensive than on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this and it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady or a little girl</li>
            <li> My family member bought me a bottle Gucci Women&#x27;s Premiere for holiday, it has no perfume cent but alcohol; it seems like it has been sitting in warehouse for a long time.</li>
            <li> I only wear one other perfume, but I got a sample of this and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I spray a little on daily and the smell seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> I usually veer toward florals, both complex and simple, but this fragrance is decidedly different from what I normally wear.  </li>
            <li> the perfume lid broke from first use and it was difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected when I order it online. . .</li>
            <li> To start, I wear a scent for my enjoyment and am sensitive to others who don&#x27;t care for the wake left behind when people wear too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably a little too heavy for Texas summers, but I&#x27;m wearing it as my daily perfume now.</li>
            <li> The problem, in less than 2 hours I couldn&#x27;t smell it .</li>
            <li> it was like walking into Macy&#x27;s but half the price</li>
            <li> It not sweet</li>
            <li> So while I really like the perfume I was disappointed in it&#x27;s lasting ability.</li>
            <li> My perfumes were getting a little &amp;#34;one note&amp;#34; and I needed something a little darker to add spice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap perfume</li>

            <li> I tried Gucci Premiere in a dept. store and loved it. It lasted all day. It was the exact same product. The bottle I received had the same exact fragrance, delightful ! The problem, in less than 2 hours I couldn&#x27;t smell it . I checked again at the dept. store and it was indeed the same. So while I really like the perfume I was disappointed in it&#x27;s lasting ability. It&#x27;s not a cheap perfume so I guess I won&#x27;t be ordering it again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a really sophisticated fragrance.  I usually veer toward florals, both complex and simple, but this fragrance is decidedly different from what I normally wear.  Although it has floral notes, it also has a musky, woodsy undertone that makes it the perfect perfume for winter days and nights.  It&#x27;s a little heavier and headier than a true floral making it truly unique in my collection.  I wanted something different, off the beaten path.  My perfumes were getting a little &amp;#34;one note&amp;#34; and I needed something a little darker to add spice.  In the wintertime I usually use Guerlain&#x27;s Samsara but it&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.  When I discovered the Gucci Premiere I had to take the plunge.  I bought the huge size because it&#x27;s a much better buy and I&#x27;d hoped that I would like it well enough use the entire large bottle.  The bottle itself is gorgeous, a beautiful gold that shines among my clear glass bottles.  I recently purchased Givenchy&#x27;s Very Irresistible and along with the Premiere, I have my two distinctly different fragrances for the winter.  Very Irresistible is a true floral and a very unique one.  With these two new perfumes, I&#x27;m equipped for the frigid winter months and into spring.  I definitely recommend Premiere and this price.  I paid much more in Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> I only wear one other perfume, but I got a sample of this and decided to try it.  I like it!  Probably a little too heavy for Texas summers, but I&#x27;m wearing it as my daily perfume now.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.It is classy,elegant,warm and feminine. I would highly recommend.I applied it as soon as i received it from Amazon,and kept smelling it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> Let me say I love this fragrance the product is geniune and what a wow factor for the price!! I will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she cant stop talking about it. &amp;#34;Its look and smell is sophisticating &amp; elegant.&amp;#34; I made the right choice this time and you too if you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product!!!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good perfume for over a year.  When I came across this one, I finally found the one!  Very nice, soft fragrance.  I love the bottle it comes in too.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Definitly my favorite fragrance right now. Took a week to be delivered, wish it gave the option for 2-3 days without addtional charges. None the less, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Arrived as her birthday gift. I think she&#x27;s quite happy with the gift. I can judge from her message. Another pleasant purchase experience in Amazon.com</li>
            <li> My family member bought me a bottle Gucci Women&#x27;s Premiere for holiday, it has no perfume cent but alcohol; it seems like it has been sitting in warehouse for a long time. I am very dissatisfied. But it is a flammable item and not able to return it. Shopper be ware when you purchase this perfume; I waste my money; no more Gucci Premiere for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a close friend of mine &amp; she just can&#x27;t stop talking about it. She knows perfumes and I can bet anyone who knows perfumes will consider this to be their top favorites. So stop thinking and go ahead and buy it and make your friend or the special women in your life feel that she deserves nothing but the best.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume for women ! It not sweet&lt;br /&gt;and girlie, although those types of fragrances have their place. This is my special occasion choice.Even the bottle deserves a special place. Let me add that I can depend on Amazon for great pricing too.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter wanted to surprise me for Christmas but didn&#x27;t know how this smelled and was cautious to order on Amazon without knowing the scent.  It smells beautiful.  I&#x27;m so glad she decided to get it for me and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Will definitely order again. I am constantly getting complimented on it. The price is better than at Sephora</li>
            <li> This fragrance is by far one of my favorites! I work at Dillards, whereits over 100$, so when I found it on here for cheaper, i jumped.on it, I love the fragrance and get compliments on it all the time! I would reccomend it any time!</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great. I spray a little on daily and the smell seems to last all day. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love all most of the perfumes from Gucci.  I waited  this perfume since last year but it was too expensive.  I finally found it on Amazon and bought it.  I love the scent for cooler weather.  It last forever.</li>
            <li> Found another fragrance that I love :) I get many compliments from men &amp; women. I don&#x27;t know about others, but mine stay on all day!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Must say I am in love with it, my sister and mother love it as well so much that they have to sneak in and take my perfume not cool lol.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Wonderful smell, but, doesn&#x27;t the length of the smell doesn&#x27;t last long enough. May EDPs differ from brand to brand, or year to year, product to product.</li>
            <li> Good product and size bought it for a birthday present and she was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, It smells really great and has strong staying power. I recomend to buy this fragrance</li>
            <li> Perfume smells beautiful works. Its a beautiful scent very soft and delicate. Loving it! It works well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I was SOOOOOOOO diasppointed in this purchase.. I love this perfume and so was delightred to see it on sale on Amazon.com.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and then when I got it put some on right away but a short while later cild nto smell it.&lt;br /&gt;Same thing happens every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I am an Amazon Prime member and wanted to return this but fifgured.I had used it for a week and they wouldnot take it back.&lt;br /&gt;disapponted in Boston............</li>
            <li> Thank you!!! I love it, smells so good and it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love perfume and wear it everyday. This one I like, but I don&#x27;t know if I can say I love it. It does last for several hours and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, which is always a plus! :) I like it because it is warm, with a little bit of spice!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product is a must have! Just what I expected when I order it online. . .</li>
            <li> Classy and sexy feeling when I wear this fragrance, my husband loves it as well. It&#x27;s almost time to buy more. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume and the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I would like the fragrance to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Just carry a small atomizer I your purse.  You won&#x27;t want to be without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Premiere. I will be replenishing when I start getting low!</li>
            <li> My second bottle, last all day.</li>
            <li> i don;t think the parfum is original because the smell doesnt last long and i am not satisfied</li>
            <li> Don\\&quot;t strong and smell doesn&#x27;t stay in 10 minutes. I am very absent . Very nice presentation but price 99cents</li>
            <li> Wonderful price! I bought this exact item in Rome, Italy and it was more expensive than on Amazon! Lovely, deep floral scent with a little musk to it. Bottle is beautiful- semi see through. Lasting scent.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a xmax gift and she love&#x27;s it and i lvoe it on here this is a good buy</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t get ENOUGH of this smell. I have had this 2.5 oz container since August, I use it daily... It doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of perfume, but it&#x27;s lasted me awhile. DEFINITELY worth the $60.</li>
            <li> The package arivd very quickly, love the smell,resivd lots of complements -:)</li>
            <li> Consider this fragrance to make you feel a little more &amp;#34;dressed-up&amp;#34; and extra-special.  While wearing, be prepared for compliments.  Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a new favorite fragrance of mine!!! I get sooo many compliments from both men &amp; women when I wear it!!!  It is not over-powering, but very noticeable!!! It has a very unique &amp;  sophisticated smell!!!  You will love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, small amount lasts forever, it seems.  As fresh and awesome at day end as was in am.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Gucci Women&#x27;s Gucci Premiere Eau de Parfum Natural Spray really smells great and has strong staying power.&lt;br /&gt;My wife really liked it and i will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a unique floral, yet musky fragrance that is super bold and also has great staying power. If you want your scent to be noticed, this is the fragrance for you.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and i loved the smell and seemed to have lasted a lot longer. I bought this and it does not last long at all. I&#x27;m actually quite disappointed about this purchase. I expected more from Gucci.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells nice and pleasant at the first sniff, but it doesn&#x27;t stay that way. The way it smells when it first goes on is a lot different 3 hours later. Just not that same aroma that grabs you in the beginning. Gucci Guilty is much better.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much at the store when I tried it that I had to have it. Also gave it as a Xmas gift. The price is much better at amazon compared to the retail price.</li>
            <li> Definitely a perfume for a nice evening out or when your feeling exceptionally sexy and expensive! ;) Perfect for chic women between 30-50. I wanted something warm, sexy &amp; bubbly...different from what most of my friends are wearing right now such as D&amp;G&#x27;s The One. Love both but this scent makes me feel like I am standing out from the crowd.  It doesn&#x27;t have that caramel like undertone; not as sweet. But, if you like The One you should try or at least test this fragrance against your own body chemistry.  I&#x27;d say you just may like it!</li>
            <li> the perfume lid broke from first use and it was difficult to open. also, the smile does not stay for 15 min.</li>
            <li> V E R R Y  G O O D  P R O D U C T&lt;br /&gt;V E R R Y  G O O D  P R O D U C T</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and glad I did.  She smelt a sample of this and other Gucci scents and fell in love with this one.  I did as well once she started wearing it.  It is fresh, feminine, and current.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady or a little girl so it is perfect for a young woman.  I can&#x27;t say if there is any issue with the sprayer or anything but it seemed well made for a dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm&lt;br /&gt;mmm mmmm mmmmm kmmmm. Mmmm mmmmm mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmm mmm mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmm mmm mmm good</li>
            <li> To start, I wear a scent for my enjoyment and am sensitive to others who don&#x27;t care for the wake left behind when people wear too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m a huggie kinda gal and when I began wearing this the compliments flooded in!!! It&#x27;s a bit heavy for summer though.</li>
            <li> it smells great not to strong which is good specially when riding together in our car. I recommend this parfume to any lady that wants to be noticed by her great smell.</li>
            <li> it was like walking into Macy&#x27;s but half the price</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Put it on sale for me again! Thanks for the fast shipment in time for the holidays!</li>
            <li> Gucci Premiere smells elegant. And additionally it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It  meet my expectations and i can use it in summer and winter.</li>
