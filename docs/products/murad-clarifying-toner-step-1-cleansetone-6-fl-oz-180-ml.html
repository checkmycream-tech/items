            <li>So far it is one of the best toners that I have used on my face.</li>
            <li>This toner felt more like a very strong astringent and burned my skin within seconds of application.</li>
            <li>Best of the best, definitely recommend this one for sensitive and/or t-zone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin prone to acne and this toner is great.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv.</li>
            <li>I can say that I LOVE murad products.  </li>

            <li>I love Murad products.</li>
            <li>So refreshing...</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it broke me out even more.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does not irritate my sensive skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to continue using this.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress how much I love this toner.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect toner for my oily skin after all these years :).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I used witch hazel and this does not seem to be any better.</li>
            <li>Love Murad products.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a shampoo-style cap and it&#x27;s much more convenient.</li>
            <li>I have sensitivity to most products, if I find something that agrees with me I stick with it</li>
            <li>Love this toner.</li>
            <li>And use it on top of pimples when I get one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using Murad products for many years and for the most part, I get outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>All their products are wonderful and I use them daily.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the murad products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product - nice to have an oil-eliminating toner that&#x27;s somewhat gentle and without alcohol.</li>
            <li>it is pretty good if you need that firming on the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read countless reviews and they seemed to be very good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, it feels refreshing and cleanses without over drying.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell good or really like anything.</li>
            <li>Strong odor, but it leaves my skin feeling tingly clean!</li>
            <li>Nice and cool fresh feeling!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced anything more than an occasional pimple since I started using Murad products 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>This is the best toner, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I would also say that these products work best for oily/combination skin since they have a slight drying effect.  </li>
            <li>I used it a while back and the ingredients worked great.</li>
            <li>, I also enjoy the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t smell or burn and removes dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li>No changes in pore size, the only good thing is the refreshing sensation it has.</li>
            <li>This Murad toner is great at removing excess oil and has only a light, clean fragrance and no stinging or lingering tingling from anything like eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and it makes your face feel fresh and clean after you use it!</li>
            <li>perhaps they work fine for people with a mild problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to love Murad products, the price is reasonable and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Has a very nice cooling touch, doesn&#x27;t burn or dry the skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed this toner did a great job of keeping my skin so fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li>so I think this is a great product that could work for many even though I&#x27;m not sure about using it myself.</li>
            <li>Very recommended for neutral skin... Love it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..still using it and love the feeling</li>
            <li>this has worked for me to some extent for oil control and the price was not bad used along with cleanser and correcting cream</li>
            <li>Leaves sking fresh, clean, glowing and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially in the summer when I need it the most.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite toner.  </li>
            <li>It has quite an alcohol smell but it tones nice &amp; deep.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of using Murad, try it with the whole system first... before trying to work one of the items into your already-there beauty routine (the system as a whole works better as an &amp;#34;all-or-nothing&amp;#34; type deal... but some of their products can be used successfully with other skin care regimens).</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying the 30 day kit to see if it is right for you.</li>
            <li>This toner is great and has left my skin looking more even toned with less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a break out for 3 months now and my skin is finally healing, but I will never forget how horrid Murad worked for me and I strongly encourage people not to buy it!</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after application, but I think I started to break  out a little more after I started using this product</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter likes Murad&#x27;s toner and says it does a good job helping her keep her skin clear.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>However, it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I first tried this in a sample size</li>
            <li>Excellent product and would recommend to anyone with troubled spots or skin</li>
            <li>Can a product that is this harsh be good for your skin?</li>
            <li>it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely but works better than anything else i have tried before.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and my skin just feels soft and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for a few days now, and it really does a good job of cleaning your skin post cleansing.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strong medical smell, and I will get sting from using it.</li>
            <li>This toner makes my face feel clean and fresh, but does not give my skin that super tight shrinking feel.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, yet cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Now, the product is very drying.</li>
            <li>i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li>So really you won&#x27;t know if the product will truly work for you until you use it.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin in my T-zone as well as a blackhead problem.  </li>
            <li>none of these kinds of products online are really going to help if you have cystic</li>
            <li>and it really changed my life.</li>
            <li>Burned my whole face.</li>
            <li>I questioned if it wasn&#x27;t really the Murad Clarifying Toner.</li>
            <li>Murad products really work.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try Murad, the entire system, to replace Proactiv because Proactiv wasn&#x27;t leaving my face completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Idk if it was the real deal or not.</li>
            <li>Using this product nightly really keeps my breakouts away</li>
            <li>and I really like this toner.  </li>
            <li>I never used toners before because they were always very drying and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>so I can feel it cleansing and closing my pores, but be ware that it is intense.</li>
            <li>It really removes remnants of makeup that linger after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>It really helps control the oil and face demons.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>BUT after a week or 2 using it my face has been clear ever since!!!</li>
            <li>aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li>and my skin did start getting worse again, so I bought a nice big bottle :)</li>
            <li>Some of the pimples hurt and even got more black heads.</li>
            <li>Since implementing this into my skin care regimen, my face has become softer, more even and less acne</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get on insurance and go see one and let me tell you it changed my life!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel the clean, tight skin right away and this will prepare your face for gel and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product really does remove all oil from your face and leaves it clear for a mattifier and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better than ever now that I&#x27;ve been using Murad for a few months.</li>
            <li>I have skin that tends to break out from pretty much everything, and this is the only toner I found that calms it.</li>
            <li>I normally use neutrogena and boy</li>
            <li>Murad&#x27;s other products work perfectly fine on my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I was surprised by how well the Murad Clarifying Toner along with occasional use of the Clarify Cleanser has cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>was the only one that cleared my skin up fast!  </li>
            <li>This toner does work against adult acne!  </li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and my acne is clearing up (when paired with other Murad products).</li>
            <li>I have slight red blemishes on my chin but mostly my issue has been clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>It is cold to the touch at 1st but feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So you can&#x27;t expect this product to clear up your skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product to me and within 2 weeks my face was completely clear and has been for over 2 months now.</li>
            <li>I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my oily skin.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been two weeks</li>
            <li>It does not make me breakout, which is a miracle since my skin is beyond sensitive.</li>
            <li>Brought back high school Seabreeze memories!</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have VERY oily face, or combination skin, then use it only on those areas.</li>
            <li>Definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing getting adult acne</li>
            <li>Fast delivery I use it daily!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel a bit tighter, oil free and for a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Luckily after discontinuing use, things calmed down-</li>
            <li>at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li>Apparently my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>And since then I&#x27;ve only had 2-3 new pimples show up.</li>
            <li>I still have some breakouts due to stress, but if you use this product they go away much quicker!  </li>
            <li>However, I think it keeps my skin oil free for a long time so less acne problem.</li>
            <li>You cannot possibly expect any cosmetics to clear up your skin.</li>
            <li>But clearly works differently for everybody</li>
            <li>I use the clarifying cleanser, the clarifying toner and a moisturizer for day and a different one for night - my skin is clear as can be</li>
            <li>The next day the skin was peeling around the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and this toner has only ever helped.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product several times over the past year and it has helped improve my skin after I clean with the murad cleansing foam.  </li>
            <li>I have used other toners/astringents and they all seemed to have overpowering scents or eucalyptus oils which I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, not a single zit.</li>
            <li>so i need something that will not completely dry out my skin too</li>
            <li>Somewhat concerned by the apparent love-it-or-hate reaction that most people seem to have to these products, I was doubtful as to their potential efficacy in combatting the (cystic) acne suffered by myself and others who take antidepressants such as Lexapro or Wellbutrin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first few days of using these products, I have already noticed a significant improvement in the state of my formerly clear skin.</li>
            <li>It will not dry problem skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed.</li>
            <li>But mostly where you have bad acne or other troublesome spots, which means that it&#x27;s working to clean out those areas and tighten the pores so dirt doesn&#x27;t go in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> - his skin looks better after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv.</li>
            <li> I can say that I LOVE murad products.  </li>
            <li> and I love their moisturizer too.  </li>
            <li> I love Murad products.</li>
            <li> So refreshing...</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that it broke me out even more.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not irritate my sensive skin.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to continue using this.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much I love this toner.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect toner for my oily skin after all these years :).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I used witch hazel and this does not seem to be any better.</li>
            <li> Love Murad products.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a shampoo-style cap and it&#x27;s much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity to most products, if I find something that agrees with me I stick with it</li>
            <li> Love this toner.</li>
            <li> And use it on top of pimples when I get one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for many years and for the most part, I get outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> All their products are wonderful and I use them daily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the murad products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product - nice to have an oil-eliminating toner that&#x27;s somewhat gentle and without alcohol.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good if you need that firming on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read countless reviews and they seemed to be very good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, it feels refreshing and cleanses without over drying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell good or really like anything.</li>
            <li> Strong odor, but it leaves my skin feeling tingly clean!</li>
            <li> Nice and cool fresh feeling!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced anything more than an occasional pimple since I started using Murad products 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I would also say that these products work best for oily/combination skin since they have a slight drying effect.  </li>
            <li> I used it a while back and the ingredients worked great.</li>
            <li> , I also enjoy the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t smell or burn and removes dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> No changes in pore size, the only good thing is the refreshing sensation it has.</li>
            <li> This Murad toner is great at removing excess oil and has only a light, clean fragrance and no stinging or lingering tingling from anything like eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and it makes your face feel fresh and clean after you use it!</li>
            <li> perhaps they work fine for people with a mild problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to love Murad products, the price is reasonable and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice cooling touch, doesn&#x27;t burn or dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed this toner did a great job of keeping my skin so fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I think this is a great product that could work for many even though I&#x27;m not sure about using it myself.</li>
            <li> Very recommended for neutral skin... Love it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..still using it and love the feeling</li>
            <li> this has worked for me to some extent for oil control and the price was not bad used along with cleanser and correcting cream</li>
            <li> Leaves sking fresh, clean, glowing and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially in the summer when I need it the most.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite toner.  </li>
            <li> It has quite an alcohol smell but it tones nice &amp; deep.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of using Murad, try it with the whole system first... before trying to work one of the items into your already-there beauty routine (the system as a whole works better as an &amp;#34;all-or-nothing&amp;#34; type deal... but some of their products can be used successfully with other skin care regimens).</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying the 30 day kit to see if it is right for you.</li>
            <li> This toner is great and has left my skin looking more even toned with less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a break out for 3 months now and my skin is finally healing, but I will never forget how horrid Murad worked for me and I strongly encourage people not to buy it!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after application, but I think I started to break  out a little more after I started using this product</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter likes Murad&#x27;s toner and says it does a good job helping her keep her skin clear.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> However, it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I first tried this in a sample size</li>
            <li> Excellent product and would recommend to anyone with troubled spots or skin</li>
            <li> Can a product that is this harsh be good for your skin?</li>
            <li> it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely but works better than anything else i have tried before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and my skin just feels soft and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for a few days now, and it really does a good job of cleaning your skin post cleansing.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong medical smell, and I will get sting from using it.</li>
            <li> This toner makes my face feel clean and fresh, but does not give my skin that super tight shrinking feel.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, yet cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Now, the product is very drying.</li>
            <li> i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li> So really you won&#x27;t know if the product will truly work for you until you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin in my T-zone as well as a blackhead problem.  </li>
            <li> none of these kinds of products online are really going to help if you have cystic</li>
            <li> and it really changed my life.</li>
            <li> Burned my whole face.</li>
            <li> I questioned if it wasn&#x27;t really the Murad Clarifying Toner.</li>
            <li> Murad products really work.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try Murad, the entire system, to replace Proactiv because Proactiv wasn&#x27;t leaving my face completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Idk if it was the real deal or not.</li>
            <li> Using this product nightly really keeps my breakouts away</li>
            <li> and I really like this toner.  </li>
            <li> I never used toners before because they were always very drying and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> so I can feel it cleansing and closing my pores, but be ware that it is intense.</li>
            <li> It really removes remnants of makeup that linger after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> It really helps control the oil and face demons.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> BUT after a week or 2 using it my face has been clear ever since!!!</li>
            <li> aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li> and my skin did start getting worse again, so I bought a nice big bottle :)</li>
            <li> Some of the pimples hurt and even got more black heads.</li>
            <li> Since implementing this into my skin care regimen, my face has become softer, more even and less acne</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get on insurance and go see one and let me tell you it changed my life!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel the clean, tight skin right away and this will prepare your face for gel and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product really does remove all oil from your face and leaves it clear for a mattifier and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better than ever now that I&#x27;ve been using Murad for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have skin that tends to break out from pretty much everything, and this is the only toner I found that calms it.</li>
            <li> I normally use neutrogena and boy</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s other products work perfectly fine on my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I was surprised by how well the Murad Clarifying Toner along with occasional use of the Clarify Cleanser has cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> was the only one that cleared my skin up fast!  </li>
            <li> This toner does work against adult acne!  </li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and my acne is clearing up (when paired with other Murad products).</li>
            <li> I have slight red blemishes on my chin but mostly my issue has been clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> It is cold to the touch at 1st but feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So you can&#x27;t expect this product to clear up your skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and within 2 weeks my face was completely clear and has been for over 2 months now.</li>
            <li> I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my oily skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been two weeks</li>
            <li> It does not make me breakout, which is a miracle since my skin is beyond sensitive.</li>
            <li> Brought back high school Seabreeze memories!</li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have VERY oily face, or combination skin, then use it only on those areas.</li>
            <li> Definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing getting adult acne</li>
            <li> Fast delivery I use it daily!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel a bit tighter, oil free and for a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels clean and tight.</li>
            <li> Luckily after discontinuing use, things calmed down-</li>
            <li> at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li> Apparently my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> And since then I&#x27;ve only had 2-3 new pimples show up.</li>
            <li> I still have some breakouts due to stress, but if you use this product they go away much quicker!  </li>
            <li> However, I think it keeps my skin oil free for a long time so less acne problem.</li>
            <li> You cannot possibly expect any cosmetics to clear up your skin.</li>
            <li> But clearly works differently for everybody</li>
            <li> I use the clarifying cleanser, the clarifying toner and a moisturizer for day and a different one for night - my skin is clear as can be</li>
            <li> The next day the skin was peeling around the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and this toner has only ever helped.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times over the past year and it has helped improve my skin after I clean with the murad cleansing foam.  </li>
            <li> I have used other toners/astringents and they all seemed to have overpowering scents or eucalyptus oils which I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, not a single zit.</li>
            <li> so i need something that will not completely dry out my skin too</li>
            <li> Somewhat concerned by the apparent love-it-or-hate reaction that most people seem to have to these products, I was doubtful as to their potential efficacy in combatting the (cystic) acne suffered by myself and others who take antidepressants such as Lexapro or Wellbutrin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first few days of using these products, I have already noticed a significant improvement in the state of my formerly clear skin.</li>
            <li> It will not dry problem skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed.</li>
            <li> But mostly where you have bad acne or other troublesome spots, which means that it&#x27;s working to clean out those areas and tighten the pores so dirt doesn&#x27;t go in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since my skin is not usually sensitive and I generally have a high pain threshold, I tried it again a few days later and got the same result.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin in the winter and slightly oily skin in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this along with the other Murad products, my skin has never been so clear.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean off the excess oil without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s with extremely oily skin that can be sensitive to certain chemicals in some products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never received extra acne or dry spots from it, and I literally cannot wash my face without using this after.</li>
            <li> I will admit that there is a slight sting/tingle from the alcohol that lasts for a few seconds, but overall my skins feels very refreshed afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I am not young anymore</li>
            <li> but I was left with scars and an empty wallet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on different products to fix it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the murad toner I have purchased from other stores.</li>
            <li> These products made my skin worse than it has ever been in my whole life.</li>
            <li> few years back</li>
            <li> I know it says to give it a few weeks and that pimples will come out initially then go away</li>
            <li> The only problem it immediately harshly dries out the skin.</li>
            <li> Previous experience with Murad products has been excellant but the Clarifying Toner was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID</li>
            <li> I stopped breaking out so wanted to use some other brand, which was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> Despite the rapid onset of progress, I plan on sticking with the toner and cleanser through at least the next 4-6 weeks as that is how long it typically takes for any medication to produce its full-effect.</li>
            <li> It calmed a very large and horrible breakout I had right before I bought it.</li>
            <li> In the winter I may slow down my usage; only because i get drier skin then.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days of using this toner in conjuntion with the other Murad products, I started breaking out!</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather deal with little white/black heads every once in a while</li>
            <li> A little on the spend side though.</li>
            <li> reviewers have commented on it stinging - and it does a little bit.</li>
            <li> , so i had bought the toner and man it did have a little burn</li>
            <li> I typically purchase this from Sephora, but typed it into Amazon&#x27;s search feature, only to find that not only is it $4 less expensive, but it qualifies for free/Prime shipping!    </li>
            <li> it has not let me down yet!</li>
            <li> It only made my face look worse.</li>
            <li> Also, the cleanser removes any dirt left behind even after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> but I still like to use this toner few times a week.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the process, but this was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> and face had broke out pretty bad</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now after washing my face, but before my Murad moisturizer, and I have had very few breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I think about this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Murad line, hate this toner!</li>
            <li> Makes me break out. :/</li>
            <li> It tightens my pores and balances the excessive oil in my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products.</li>
            <li> A few months back I was having some really bad breakouts on my chin, around my mouth and even on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> I still have blemishes but they are slowly going away.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive on Amazon than at the store.</li>
            <li> But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.</li>
            <li> Only issue is the cap is annoying to take on/off.</li>
            <li> I have the worst skin and its sensitive at that</li>
            <li> As if I didn&#x27;t already feel bad enough about having a problem with acne, this stuff made my skin inflamed and painful 10 fold.</li>
            <li> Sadly, because the product says it may take up to 6 weeks to see results, I made myself keep using it for 2 months, in hope that things would improve.</li>
            <li> My skin was so terrible by the time I decided to stop that I actually cried.</li>
            <li> then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> If you are truly desperate, save the money to see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I like the way its cold</li>
            <li> I am deployed now and it gets real dusty out here</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars because the smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t sting when you apply it.</li>
            <li> So badly that I was embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use it. :-(</li>
            <li> VERY COLD.</li>
            <li> then those nasty pimples I was getting using Murad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best of the best, definitely recommend this one for sensitive and/or t-zone skin. Works wonders, especially when used with the rest of the product line. If you are thinking of using Murad, try it with the whole system first... before trying to work one of the items into your already-there beauty routine (the system as a whole works better as an &amp;#34;all-or-nothing&amp;#34; type deal... but some of their products can be used successfully with other skin care regimens).</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin prone to acne and this toner is great. It has quite an alcohol smell but it tones nice &amp; deep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Murad products. I use the cleanser and spot treatment, and when my son&#x27;s face starting breaking out, I added the toner to his regimen.  Good stuff - his skin looks better after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toner for a couple of years and I like it. It helps reduce the oily look that I sometimes in my T-zone area and especially on my nose. The toner definitely leaves a &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; after use.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase this from Sephora, but typed it into Amazon&#x27;s search feature, only to find that not only is it $4 less expensive, but it qualifies for free/Prime shipping!    This is the best toner, hands down.  It is gentle, yet cleansing.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser.  I wanted to buy a toner in the same family to maximize my results.  I&#x27;ve noticed an over all decrease in my breakouts, and it also shortens the duration of my breakouts.  I&#x27;m really happy with this toner and happy to have found a product that works on my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I think about this product. I used it a while back and the ingredients worked great. Now, the product is very drying. So, I will not use it every day--maybe only 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter likes Murad&#x27;s toner and says it does a good job helping her keep her skin clear.</li>
            <li> Strong odor, but it leaves my skin feeling tingly clean!</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad. I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID but they never fully got rid of my pimples. So then I tried murad at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face i had never had anything like that in my whole life. But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.I had not seen blackheads on my face since i was a teen. Even though i have stopped using murad for about two weeks it&#x27;s damage is still being done. my face has those big red pimples all over it and some are still coming up because of the blackheads. The healing process is taking longer then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy. All i have to say is buyer beware.</li>
            <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Dr. Murad&#x27;s products are wonderful for all skin types, and I have tried them all. You will have noticeably clearer skin using twice per day. It will not dry problem skin, yet you will feel that your skin has been deeply cleansed. It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena or ProActiv. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here.</li>
            <li> So for anyone who hasn&#x27;t already discovered this....EVERY skincare product will react differently for each person.  So really you won&#x27;t know if the product will truly work for you until you use it.  Knowing this...I can say that I LOVE murad products.  I have very oily skin in my T-zone as well as a blackhead problem.  I have slight red blemishes on my chin but mostly my issue has been clogged pores.  I&#x27;ve been using the Murad acne products for three months now and I&#x27;ve had good results with them.  I still have blemishes but they are slowly going away.  The products make my skin feel so good and they smell great too!  I would recommend trying the 30 day kit to see if it is right for you. I would also say that these products work best for oily/combination skin since they have a slight drying effect.  (I&#x27;ve also used Proactiv but it made my face crack and flake. Murad does not have the same effect.)</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels in my skin.! Big bottle, feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially in the summer when I need it the most.  In the winter I may slow down my usage; only because i get drier skin then.  When my skin is oily in the summer this works wonders!  I had tried all different products for oily skin and Murad was the only one that cleared my skin up fast!  I am not young anymore so i need something that will not completely dry out my skin too and I love their moisturizer too.  Overall I would recommend this line to anyone~ it has not let me down yet!</li>
            <li> I love Murad products. My skin is looking better than ever now that I&#x27;ve been using Murad for a few months. The toner is especially easy to use with great results. It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, it feels refreshing and cleanses without over drying.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find and I hvae used this product for years and love the results and will buy again</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been two weeks and it dries up acne without drying out my skin, I also enjoy the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and it makes your face feel fresh and clean after you use it!</li>
            <li> You cannot possibly expect any cosmetics to clear up your skin. You would know this by now if you&#x27;ve been trying out every possible solution out there. So you can&#x27;t expect this product to clear up your skin from breaking out. However, I think it keeps my skin oil free for a long time so less acne problem.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this toner for over a year - absolutely love it! I have skin that tends to break out from pretty much everything, and this is the only toner I found that calms it. I use it in the mornings instead of washing my face, before moisturizing. It seems to clean off the excess oil without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the Murad skin care kit sold on here. These products made my skin worse than it has ever been in my whole life. As if I didn&#x27;t already feel bad enough about having a problem with acne, this stuff made my skin inflamed and painful 10 fold. Sadly, because the product says it may take up to 6 weeks to see results, I made myself keep using it for 2 months, in hope that things would improve. My skin was so terrible by the time I decided to stop that I actually cried. Luckily after discontinuing use, things calmed down- but I was left with scars and an empty wallet. If you are truly desperate, save the money to see a dermatologist. I was lucky enough to get on insurance and go see one and let me tell you it changed my life! You need oral meds and prescription topicals- none of these kinds of products online are really going to help if you have cystic acne- perhaps they work fine for people with a mild problem. I haven&#x27;t had a break out for 3 months now and my skin is finally healing, but I will never forget how horrid Murad worked for me and I strongly encourage people not to buy it! I wanted to give it zero stars, but the site wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong medical smell, and I will get sting from using it. Not recommend for people to use it.</li>
            <li> I starlet using Murad clarifying Toner few years back and it really changed my life. So refreshing... Very recommended for neutral skin... Love it</li>
            <li> Garbage. Burned my whole face. This isn&#x27;t a toner this is a fatal chemical that can land you in the hospital.</li>
            <li> this has worked for me to some extent for oil control and the price was not bad used along with cleanser and correcting cream it has work better than the other acne products i have used,although it never cleared up my acne completely but works better than anything else i have tried before. But clearly works differently for everybody</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use this as step one. You&#x27;ll feel the clean, tight skin right away and this will prepare your face for gel and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This toner creates a calling feeling. It calmed a very large and horrible breakout I had right before I bought it. And since then I&#x27;ve only had 2-3 new pimples show up. (2 week period)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin adding in this product to the three step murad system that I am already using. I ahve adult acne and wasn&#x27;t impressed. Didn&#x27;t smell good or really like anything. I questioned if it wasn&#x27;t really the Murad Clarifying Toner. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Been using this toner for years.  I use it after I cleanse as well as in the middle of the day if I&#x27;m just staying home and don&#x27;t have make-up on.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t smell or burn and removes dirt and oil.  I buy 3 at a time so that I don&#x27;t run out and it&#x27;s cheaper that way then when I&#x27;m on the last bottle I order my next batch of 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> Great deal for this product!!!. What more can I say. Do not like that I have to writing review, said enough</li>
            <li> Very good toner for cleansing pores.  So far it is one of the best toners that I have used on my face. Definitely works for deep cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> Murad products really work.  I&#x27;ve paid all sorts of money and tried all sorts of product, but i&#x27;m sticking to this.  I use the clarifying cleanser, the clarifying toner and a moisturizer for day and a different one for night - my skin is clear as can be and i get compliments</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Murad, the entire system, to replace Proactiv because Proactiv wasn&#x27;t leaving my face completely smooth. Now, I have oily skin. I used Murad for 2 months and I have to say that it broke me out even more. So badly that I was embarrassed. I haven&#x27;t had deep zit like pimples until I used Murad. I never used to get pimples on my cheeks and this gave them to me, including around my upper lip, around the side of my mouth and chin. Some of the pimples hurt and even got more black heads. I know it says to give it a few weeks and that pimples will come out initially then go away and that&#x27;s the process, but this was pretty bad. It only made my face look worse. I went back to Proactiv and in 4 days those deep pimples are almost all gone. I&#x27;d rather deal with little white/black heads every once in a while then those nasty pimples I was getting using Murad. I wouldn&#x27;t use for my face again. It may work for some others but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I have had acne practically all of my teen/early adulthood and this is the only product that has done wonders. I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful. I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li> This toner makes my face feel clean and fresh, but does not give my skin that super tight shrinking feel. It does not make me breakout, which is a miracle since my skin is beyond sensitive. I have been using it for a few months now after washing my face, but before my Murad moisturizer, and I have had very few breakouts. I will keep using.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I was surprised by how well the Murad Clarifying Toner along with occasional use of the Clarify Cleanser has cleared up my acne. Somewhat concerned by the apparent love-it-or-hate reaction that most people seem to have to these products, I was doubtful as to their potential efficacy in combatting the (cystic) acne suffered by myself and others who take antidepressants such as Lexapro or Wellbutrin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first few days of using these products, I have already noticed a significant improvement in the state of my formerly clear skin. Despite the rapid onset of progress, I plan on sticking with the toner and cleanser through at least the next 4-6 weeks as that is how long it typically takes for any medication to produce its full-effect. So give them a try! What do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin. Mine did have the murad hologram. Definitely the murad toner I have purchased from other stores.</li>
            <li> This is the only line I can find that treats both aging and acne. It is amazing! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s drying out my face.  I can no longer use it. :-(</li>
            <li> This toner does work against adult acne!  I still have some breakouts due to stress, but if you use this product they go away much quicker!  I have also noticed that my pores are smaller.  I recommend trying this if you have acne issues.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Murad&#x27;s cleansers, moisturizers, masks, spot treatments. When I saw this toner advertised, I thought it would only compliment my current skin regimen. Big mistake! After 3 days of using this toner in conjuntion with the other Murad products, I started breaking out! I haven&#x27;t experienced anything more than an occasional pimple since I started using Murad products 7 years ago. I stopped using the toner for a week and my outburst of pimples went away. But then I decided to reintroduce my skin to the toner again . Same reaction--pimples popping up days later. Murad&#x27;s other products work perfectly fine on my skin. But this toner doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all! I give it 2 stars because the smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t sting when you apply it. However, it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not irritate my sensive skin.  Also, the cleanser removes any dirt left behind even after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This product really does remove all oil from your face and leaves it clear for a mattifier and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the Murad line, hate this toner! Made my skin even oilier. The product I ordered came with hologram scratched off and no foil seal; Idk if it was the real deal or not. Brought back high school Seabreeze memories!</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s products are the best for acne prone skin.  A little on the spend side though.</li>
            <li> Using this product nightly really keeps my breakouts away</li>
            <li> This is probably a good product but something in this toner irritates my eyes with redness and puffiness so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> A few months back I was having some really bad breakouts on my chin, around my mouth and even on the sides of my nose. I was being really good about washing my face, using moisturizer, not piling on the makeup- but nothing seemed to help. A friend recommended this product to me and within 2 weeks my face was completely clear and has been for over 2 months now. Seriously, not a single zit. This stuff feels great and works wonders. I swear by it now.</li>
            <li> Love this face toner! Smells great as well! Great for oily skin! Simplydesignlife.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Good product to be used with murad acne gel it is pretty good if you need that firming on the skin</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and I really like this toner.  I first tried this in a sample size and I liked it.  It&#x27;s kind of cooling so your face feels nice after you put it on.  I used this along with acne gel and noticed my skin got clearer.  Once I ran out of the smaller size I decided to see if it made any difference and my skin did start getting worse again, so I bought a nice big bottle :)</li>
            <li> Yes, love this toner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for several months. I stopped breaking out so wanted to use some other brand, which was a mistake.  As soon as I changed my toner, my skin felt so oily after I put on makeup. I noticed this toner did a great job of keeping my skin so fresh for a long time.  I think this toner is perfect for people like me who break out easily and have oily skin.  But anyhow, this is my favorite toner!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves sking fresh, clean, glowing and hydrated. Has a very nice cooling touch, doesn&#x27;t burn or dry the skin.</li>
            <li> THIS GREAT FOR ACNE.  YOU FEEL THE TONER TINGLE IN YOUR SKING.  YOU MUST USE THIS FAITHFULLY EVERY DAY ALONG WITH THE FACIAL WASH IN ORDER TO SEE YOUR ACNE DIMINISH.  MURAD STANDS FOR DR. MURAD WHO A BOARD CERTIFIED DERMATOLOGIST FROM UCLA.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to continue using this. Apparently my skin is too sensitive. It always stung when applied so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I never used toners before because they were always very drying and irritated my skin. This toner is great and has left my skin looking more even toned with less breakouts. I even use it on places on my body where I tend to break out and that has cleared up as well.</li>
            <li> My new favorite toner.  Have been using for a few days now, and it really does a good job of cleaning your skin post cleansing.  It is cold to the touch at 1st but feels great on my skin.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s with extremely oily skin that can be sensitive to certain chemicals in some products.  I will admit that there is a slight sting/tingle from the alcohol that lasts for a few seconds, but overall my skins feels very refreshed afterwards.  I cannot stress how much I love this toner.  I finally found the perfect toner for my oily skin after all these years :).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I used witch hazel and this does not seem to be any better. I like the wash and the lotion the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome toner... I normally use neutrogena and boy is this item much better! Love Murad products. Recommended by massage envy.</li>
            <li> Very good toner. The only problem it immediately harshly dries out the skin. I used it once on my face, and my eye area started tingling and got immediately red. The next day the skin was peeling around the sensitive areas. Not recommended for people with sensitive skin. If you have VERY oily face, or combination skin, then use it only on those areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product - nice to have an oil-eliminating toner that&#x27;s somewhat gentle and without alcohol. Only issue is the cap is annoying to take on/off. I replaced it with a shampoo-style cap and it&#x27;s much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I like the way its cold so I can feel it cleansing and closing my pores, but be ware that it is intense. VERY COLD. But Like I said, I liked it</li>
            <li> Definitely the real deal. My skin felt clean and my acne is clearing up (when paired with other Murad products). I recommend.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this works really good along with the face wash. I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line. I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products. The face wash, toner, and aloe vera gel is all I need now even when break outs occur. I may on occasion use the Murad mask.</li>
            <li> The product falls short, I still breakout and have a lot of oil in my skin.  No changes in pore size, the only good thing is the refreshing sensation it has.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after application, but I think I started to break  out a little more after I started using this product so I went back to my chamomile tea tree oil toner.  I have sensitivity to most products, if I find something that agrees with me I stick with it so I think this is a great product that could work for many even though I&#x27;m not sure about using it myself.</li>
            <li> Previous experience with Murad products has been excellant but the Clarifying Toner was a huge disappointment. This toner felt more like a very strong astringent and burned my skin within seconds of application. It continued the burning sensation for nearly ten minutes. Since my skin is not usually sensitive and I generally have a high pain threshold, I tried it again a few days later and got the same result. It may cleanse and tone but at what price? Can a product that is this harsh be good for your skin?</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin.  My Aesthetician recommended it and it is helping me with my face acne/scar issues. Less expensive on Amazon than at the store.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel can&#x27;t touch this stuff.  Since I started using this along with the other Murad products, my skin has never been so clear.  It&#x27;s embarrassing getting adult acne and I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on different products to fix it.  This clarifying toner is a must have!</li>
            <li> Love this toner. It makes my skin feels clean and tight. I do not have pimples on my face but I still like to use this toner few times a week. And use it on top of pimples when I get one. Great price , great product</li>
            <li> I have normal skin in the winter and slightly oily skin in the summer.  I have used other toners/astringents and they all seemed to have overpowering scents or eucalyptus oils which I don&#x27;t really like.  This Murad toner is great at removing excess oil and has only a light, clean fragrance and no stinging or lingering tingling from anything like eucalyptus.  It really removes remnants of makeup that linger after washing my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and my skin just feels soft and clean after using it.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This toner responded fair with my skin. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t achieve with a 3 dollar bottle at Walgreens. I do like the smell</li>
            <li> Nice and cool fresh feeling!  Only need to use it once a day!  Excellent product and would recommend to anyone with troubled spots or skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to love Murad products, the price is reasonable and the results are great. It really helps control the oil and face demons. I would recommend this product to my friends or peers who stress a lot over their pimples.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..still using it and love the feeling</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It clears my skin from oil residual and helps with blemish control</li>
            <li> Makes me break out. :/</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I&#x27;ve bought from them 4 times now and never received a counterfeit. The toner is tingly, clean, and perfect! It makes your skin feel a bit tighter, oil free and for a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have commented on it stinging - and it does a little bit. But mostly where you have bad acne or other troublesome spots, which means that it&#x27;s working to clean out those areas and tighten the pores so dirt doesn&#x27;t go in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this toner has only ever helped. I&#x27;ve never received extra acne or dry spots from it, and I literally cannot wash my face without using this after. Since implementing this into my skin care regimen, my face has become softer, more even and less acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My system that has kept deep acne away for two years now it: Murad Time Release Acne Cleanser with a Clarisonic Mia 2, Murad Clarifying Toner, and Obagi Therapeutic Lotion for spot treatment. I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> So i have been using MURAD products for almost 2 years and these products is the best thing since slice bread!!! I am deployed now and it gets real dusty out here and face had broke out pretty bad, so i had bought the toner and man it did have a little burn BUT after a week or 2 using it my face has been clear ever since!!! Definitely use a MURAD treatment after it because it will give you a finishing touch.  Also stick to the MURAD products dont mix it up, that is how your face can break out real easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for many years and for the most part, I get outstanding results.  This is the most mediocre of all the products I&#x27;ve used on this line.</li>
            <li> my skin is VERY sensitive and I seldom find a product I can use. I will just say that this product is alcohol based, you can smell it upon opening the bottle. I&#x27;ve read countless reviews and they seemed to be very good but my skin prefers something else.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times over the past year and it has helped improve my skin after I clean with the murad cleansing foam.  All their products are wonderful and I use them daily.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed as having Rosecea acne about five years ago. This product keeps my skin from constantly breaking out. It tightens my pores and balances the excessive oil in my t-zone. This is an excellant product for my skin and I see the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the murad products. I have the worst skin and its sensitive at that so I&#x27;ve always had problems finding a product that would work for me. This has been my savior!!</li>
