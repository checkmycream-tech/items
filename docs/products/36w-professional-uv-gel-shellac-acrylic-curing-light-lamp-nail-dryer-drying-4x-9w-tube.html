            <li>I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>It has the 2 minute timer and the well where you insert your hand is a very good size.</li>
            <li>and probably I have lost a very good client.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I took the bottom off and unplugged the wire clip that went to timer, works great again.  </li>
            <li>I use this product with the Gelish nail system and it works great.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy.</li>
            <li>Works great, the 4 lamps are needed to operate, not just as extras.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with the 32 watt UV lamp.</li>
            <li>The bottom slides out to allow great access to the bulbs.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal for a UV curing lamp.  </li>
            <li>The size is great and it cures every nail at once.</li>
            <li>I am a newbie in doing my own Gel Manicure, and shopped around for the best priced lamp.</li>
            <li>It works amazing and great price!!</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also commend BrainyTrade on their great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was impressed with this light as the price was great and the reviews were great.  </li>

            <li>Awesome product! :)</li>
            <li>I am a nail tech and this light works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this light.</li>
            <li>This lamp works good on my gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works great</li>
            <li>It works great &amp; I would recommend it to anyone else looking to buy a UV light for shellac!</li>
            <li>to cure color and top coat!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice gets the job done, but tans my hands.next time</li>
            <li>I liked it so well that I purchased another machine for my daughter.</li>
            <li>had been using a friend&#x27;s machine for awhile, bought this one for myself and if I liked it, I was going to get one for my sister for xmas.  </li>
            <li>so I could start doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails and have since September when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>I just use my own timer.</li>
            <li>Very bright and cures very fast.</li>
            <li>Very easy to reset.  </li>
            <li>light bulb keep falling out when store and go to use it dont stap in socket to good to hold it in place</li>
            <li>I  love the lamp,  </li>
            <li>But I still love it.  </li>
            <li>The 120 second timer works perfectly, you just have to ensure that you have the switch on top set to &#x27;timer&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It was appropriately priced, infact in comparing it to the cost of others it was priced well below the others.</li>
            <li>any more I go to the nail salon</li>
            <li>Pkg arrived looking &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; - even more suspect when I opened the taped-up box to find virtually no instruction sheet.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li>So we are 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>The product was cracked on top when I received it.  </li>
            <li>The crack is very visible but it works great.</li>
            <li>Dries her nails in like 5-10 minutes which is way better than the 45 minutes it used to take.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok.  </li>
            <li>It will save you money if you really love doing your nails.</li>
            <li>and hers was hundreds more than this.</li>
            <li>Save up your money and invest in a better quality machine.</li>
            <li>Finally, I did my nails and they look GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a light that I could do my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>I bought replacement lights just because I figured to give it one more shot...</li>
            <li>Timer cured UV Gel builder with one use using timer (but be sure to use UV gel cleanser to remove excess gel after curing or nail will still feel tacky and not cured).  </li>
            <li>Just maybe not as timely as most would prefer.</li>
            <li>so between the cost of the unit and the cost to replace the bulbs I would have been better off purchasing the light at a Beauty Supply Store and paying the $60.00 they charge for a 36W UV Curing Lite...which would have been a better quality.</li>
            <li>I contact the vender they take care of the problem they replace my item for a new for free!!!</li>
            <li>The buttons for controlling the light and the timer are on the top which I find easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>super great deal, thanks</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I asked for , good price , good quality and super easy to use I really recommend it .</li>
            <li>Altho easy to figure out</li>
            <li>The 4 bulbs included in the package are easy to put in; you hear an audible click once it fits in to place.</li>
            <li>And it went together easily.  </li>
            <li>Changing polish is not so easy as you need to use acetone and let your nails soak it in to loosen the polish.  </li>
            <li>All of my dealings with BrainyTrade were courteous and they seemed to be interested in nothing but pleasing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine with nothing else needed.  </li>
            <li>I planned on returning it but decided to keep it since it worked fine</li>
            <li>I like the product seems to work fine just received it.</li>
            <li>It was packaged fine.  </li>
            <li>If you live in the US and do not already have a converter DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!</li>
            <li>Although, if you&#x27;re already set on doing your own nails at home who really cares about the appearance of your UV light.  </li>
            <li>Once the time is up, I have to manually turn the light off and on again.</li>
            <li>it does the job, but it is made from cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get one with a shield so the light stays within the lamp.</li>
            <li>I decided to give shellac manicures a try so ordered this light basically based on price.  </li>
            <li>I started with the gellish led light and it quit on me after 7 months.</li>
            <li>Light bulbs literally fall out or won&#x27;t stay lite.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a more powerful model.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it was me or the uv light.</li>
            <li>the light bulbs keep falling out it raddled and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.so</li>
            <li>I bought this light with my boyfriend&#x27;s account, I am a nail tech</li>
            <li>Being UV, this light works with both uv polish and led polish.  </li>
            <li>So instead of having it automatically shut off after 90-120 seconds, I have to use a clock to make sure I&#x27;m curing my nails for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It showed up perfect and is big enough to fit a Galaxy note smartphone in!  </li>
            <li>originally received a defective item</li>
            <li>All the bulbs are there although I wish it had instructions in the box, there really isn&#x27;t anything more than what is written on the box to explain it.</li>
            <li>It did not work at all but the only good thing is that I got refunded my money.</li>
            <li>Its been a little over a month and was pleased with how good it was working till it exploded on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working perfectly, i love my new lamp !</li>
            <li>The dryer has made doing my nails fast and fun!!</li>
            <li>Came quick</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>but it was exchanged super quickly.</li>
            <li>i will be looking forward to odering much more for the new year thank once again.</li>
            <li>absolutely love my new Uv Gel Curing Lamp and would recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>After contacting the seller about this , they resolved the problem real fast and with ease.</li>
            <li>I love my acrylic light, I don&#x27;t need to pay $ 5 dollars extra for the acrylic</li>
            <li>It appeared as though the kit came with 4 UV lights, as it should, then an additional set as a replacement or complimentary if you will.</li>
            <li>Like a professional AV lamp for a better price.</li>
            <li>Function wise, I give it a high 2 to low 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I bought this lamp because I needed it right away</li>
            <li>My right eye was burning and watering for hours.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and as good or better than others that are more expensive!</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more for better quality</li>
            <li>and I must say, I  am thrilled the first one was broken  because I  love this one!</li>
            <li>thank you all very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and does have a 120 second timer feature or you can use the infinit option.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that the bulbs weren&#x27;t working because they were flickering.  </li>
            <li>I was doing the second coat, the light starts SMOKING!</li>
            <li>Unplugged it and took the lights out and put them back in and tried it one more time.</li>
            <li>It just wasnt exactly as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>I even moved the bulbs around and made sure the were in properly.  </li>
            <li>This lamp is not fancy or all that pretty</li>
            <li>Nice product, but absolutely no info or instructions...</li>
            <li>Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase, would certainly recommend to a friend looking for an inexpensive UV lamp.</li>
            <li>so I thought it&#x27;d be smart of me to get the dyer and polishes and do them myself.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one hope it work&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something reliable and not dangerous to use.</li>
            <li>This is a simple to assemble by popping in the light bulbs and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This light is the same strength as the salons using the 4 bulbs</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I used this light for the second time today.</li>
            <li>Big, light weight</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>I buy all my supplies with tip money from work which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>so the light reaches all fingers), and lastly bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I did not want to spend too much, but I wanted the lamp to work.</li>
            <li>and I really hope it is</li>
            <li>It arrived fast within two days to KS (prime member)</li>
            <li>I can take the good with the bad to have nails that look nice for a much longer time.</li>
            <li>the the delivery time was good but the quality of the product was very poor, and it was damage, I rather spend a few more dollars and have a better product</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally do them.</li>
            <li>I have taken care of this item from day 1,I store in my closet after I know the bulbs had cooled, in original box and only used once a month,no drops or spills etc.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li>The dryer does dry the gel within two minutes and its also veryyyy easy to set up (install the bulbs) and plug it in</li>
            <li>Bulbs do not remove easily to replace (had to open up bottom completely).</li>
            <li>The light bulbs would constantly be falling out since they weren&#x27;t as secure as other lamps.</li>
            <li>I looked at a lot of UV lights online and did not want to spend a lot of money, yet wanted a decent lamp.  </li>
            <li>Overall would recommend, but only if you&#x27;re ok with changing the cord out.</li>
            <li>I am lucky nothing more serious happened.</li>
            <li>It cures shellac and standard polish quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to over pay to get what I needed.</li>
            <li>Be sure the bulbs snap into place tightly.</li>
            <li>highly urge you to think about not purchasing this item...</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li>I use this for curing UV sensitive glues onto phones and it works like a charm!!</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain, but at least the bulbs work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that all 4 turn on at the same time.</li>
            <li>Slide out tray is slick and good size for larger hands.</li>
            <li>While this lamp technically works, you have to jiggle the light bulbs every time you turn it on, and even then only some of the bulbs work.</li>
            <li>This product arrived and was bigger and more sturdy than I expected for the price</li>
            <li>After mixed reviews something told me to just get it because for the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I mean lets be honest a 5 year old could figure out how to operate this machine...,BUT</li>
            <li>The polish would harden but would easily peel off within a couple of days, after I did a little research I discovered</li>
            <li>I  had previously purchased another lamp that was cheaply made and didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>This light was half the price.</li>
            <li>Its a huge hassle to return and not worth the risk of them sending you something that you cannot use at all!</li>
            <li>If saving time is a huge concern, I would go with a larger box because there is really only enough room for one hand/foot.  </li>
            <li>I use the timer completely to assure product cures.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I took the power cord off an old lamp, took the bottom off the UV lamp, and swapped cords.  </li>
            <li>I received my professional nail dryer as promised.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised at the size.</li>
            <li>One of the bulbs arrived burnt out, but even with replacement this light wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cure the UV polish effectively (not unless you wanted to spend a half hour or so on each hand).</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t have a 10 second timer, it is easy enough just to count down 10 seconds</li>
            <li>However, I appreciated the low cost of this box and don&#x27;t mind taking the extra time.</li>
            <li>One bulb wont light up, then after a few minutes of use it shut off and smoke comes rolling out the back...</li>
            <li>At least for legal purposes from the perspective of the manufacturer, hopefully there are never any malfunctions.&lt;br /&gt;However, with all of that said, for the price as compared to paying $80 every 2 or 3 weeks for a mani will financially be worth it.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star only because the bulb comes loose, other than that the lamp works fine.</li>
            <li>the biggest complaint I have about this purchase was the fact that two of the light bulbs were in a million pieces when I opened the box...</li>
            <li>I left my nails in far longer than the unit required - still no luck.</li>
            <li>some of the smaller UV lights have which of course means MUCH quicker dry time.  </li>
            <li>When I was curing the second coat of gel polish on my clients nails it made a strange crackling noise and before she could remove her hand fast enough it caught on fire.</li>
            <li>And...the kit only comes with the UV lights, a Large stale looking box for the lights (which fit one hand, you could do both if you stacked your hands</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within a few minutes I had the lamp turned on and the timer button worked just the first time and thereafter not again.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how much smoke came out of this little machine and blowing the back out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> It has the 2 minute timer and the well where you insert your hand is a very good size.</li>
            <li> and probably I have lost a very good client.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I took the bottom off and unplugged the wire clip that went to timer, works great again.  </li>
            <li> I use this product with the Gelish nail system and it works great.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy.</li>
            <li> Works great, the 4 lamps are needed to operate, not just as extras.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with the 32 watt UV lamp.</li>
            <li> The bottom slides out to allow great access to the bulbs.  </li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a UV curing lamp.  </li>
            <li> The size is great and it cures every nail at once.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie in doing my own Gel Manicure, and shopped around for the best priced lamp.</li>

            <li> I also commend BrainyTrade on their great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Well made and works great.  </li>
            <li> Very nice nail dryer.</li>
            <li> I am able to give myself a great gel manicure whenever I please!  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with this light as the price was great and the reviews were great.  </li>
            <li> great product for the price works just as good as a 150 dollar lamp.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! :)</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and this light works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this light.</li>
            <li> This lamp works good on my gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great</li>
            <li> It works great &amp; I would recommend it to anyone else looking to buy a UV light for shellac!</li>
            <li> to cure color and top coat!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice gets the job done, but tans my hands.next time</li>
            <li> I liked it so well that I purchased another machine for my daughter.</li>
            <li> had been using a friend&#x27;s machine for awhile, bought this one for myself and if I liked it, I was going to get one for my sister for xmas.  </li>
            <li> so I could start doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails and have since September when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I just use my own timer.</li>
            <li> Very bright and cures very fast.</li>
            <li> Very easy to reset.  </li>
            <li> light bulb keep falling out when store and go to use it dont stap in socket to good to hold it in place</li>
            <li> I  love the lamp,  </li>
            <li> But I still love it.  </li>
            <li> The 120 second timer works perfectly, you just have to ensure that you have the switch on top set to &#x27;timer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It was appropriately priced, infact in comparing it to the cost of others it was priced well below the others.</li>
            <li> any more I go to the nail salon</li>
            <li> Pkg arrived looking &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; - even more suspect when I opened the taped-up box to find virtually no instruction sheet.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li> So we are 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> The product was cracked on top when I received it.  </li>
            <li> The crack is very visible but it works great.</li>
            <li> Dries her nails in like 5-10 minutes which is way better than the 45 minutes it used to take.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok.  </li>
            <li> It will save you money if you really love doing your nails.</li>
            <li> and hers was hundreds more than this.</li>
            <li> Save up your money and invest in a better quality machine.</li>
            <li> Finally, I did my nails and they look GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a light that I could do my own nails at home.</li>
            <li> I bought replacement lights just because I figured to give it one more shot...</li>
            <li> Timer cured UV Gel builder with one use using timer (but be sure to use UV gel cleanser to remove excess gel after curing or nail will still feel tacky and not cured).  </li>
            <li> Just maybe not as timely as most would prefer.</li>
            <li> so between the cost of the unit and the cost to replace the bulbs I would have been better off purchasing the light at a Beauty Supply Store and paying the $60.00 they charge for a 36W UV Curing Lite...which would have been a better quality.</li>
            <li> I contact the vender they take care of the problem they replace my item for a new for free!!!</li>
            <li> The buttons for controlling the light and the timer are on the top which I find easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> super great deal, thanks</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I asked for , good price , good quality and super easy to use I really recommend it .</li>
            <li> Altho easy to figure out</li>
            <li> The 4 bulbs included in the package are easy to put in; you hear an audible click once it fits in to place.</li>
            <li> And it went together easily.  </li>
            <li> Changing polish is not so easy as you need to use acetone and let your nails soak it in to loosen the polish.  </li>
            <li> All of my dealings with BrainyTrade were courteous and they seemed to be interested in nothing but pleasing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works fine with nothing else needed.  </li>
            <li> I planned on returning it but decided to keep it since it worked fine</li>
            <li> I like the product seems to work fine just received it.</li>
            <li> It was packaged fine.  </li>
            <li> If you live in the US and do not already have a converter DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!</li>
            <li> Although, if you&#x27;re already set on doing your own nails at home who really cares about the appearance of your UV light.  </li>
            <li> Once the time is up, I have to manually turn the light off and on again.</li>
            <li> it does the job, but it is made from cheap plastic...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get one with a shield so the light stays within the lamp.</li>
            <li> I decided to give shellac manicures a try so ordered this light basically based on price.  </li>
            <li> I started with the gellish led light and it quit on me after 7 months.</li>
            <li> Light bulbs literally fall out or won&#x27;t stay lite.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a more powerful model.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it was me or the uv light.</li>
            <li> the light bulbs keep falling out it raddled and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.so</li>
            <li> I bought this light with my boyfriend&#x27;s account, I am a nail tech</li>
            <li> Being UV, this light works with both uv polish and led polish.  </li>
            <li> So instead of having it automatically shut off after 90-120 seconds, I have to use a clock to make sure I&#x27;m curing my nails for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It showed up perfect and is big enough to fit a Galaxy note smartphone in!  </li>
            <li> originally received a defective item</li>
            <li> All the bulbs are there although I wish it had instructions in the box, there really isn&#x27;t anything more than what is written on the box to explain it.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all but the only good thing is that I got refunded my money.</li>
            <li> Its been a little over a month and was pleased with how good it was working till it exploded on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working perfectly, i love my new lamp !</li>
            <li> The dryer has made doing my nails fast and fun!!</li>
            <li> Came quick</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> but it was exchanged super quickly.</li>
            <li> i will be looking forward to odering much more for the new year thank once again.</li>
            <li> absolutely love my new Uv Gel Curing Lamp and would recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li> After contacting the seller about this , they resolved the problem real fast and with ease.</li>
            <li> I love my acrylic light, I don&#x27;t need to pay $ 5 dollars extra for the acrylic</li>
            <li> It appeared as though the kit came with 4 UV lights, as it should, then an additional set as a replacement or complimentary if you will.</li>
            <li> Like a professional AV lamp for a better price.</li>
            <li> Function wise, I give it a high 2 to low 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp because I needed it right away</li>
            <li> My right eye was burning and watering for hours.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and as good or better than others that are more expensive!</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little more for better quality</li>
            <li> and I must say, I  am thrilled the first one was broken  because I  love this one!</li>
            <li> thank you all very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and does have a 120 second timer feature or you can use the infinit option.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that the bulbs weren&#x27;t working because they were flickering.  </li>
            <li> I was doing the second coat, the light starts SMOKING!</li>
            <li> Unplugged it and took the lights out and put them back in and tried it one more time.</li>
            <li> It just wasnt exactly as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I even moved the bulbs around and made sure the were in properly.  </li>
            <li> This lamp is not fancy or all that pretty</li>
            <li> Nice product, but absolutely no info or instructions...</li>
            <li> Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase, would certainly recommend to a friend looking for an inexpensive UV lamp.</li>
            <li> so I thought it&#x27;d be smart of me to get the dyer and polishes and do them myself.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one hope it work&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something reliable and not dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> This is a simple to assemble by popping in the light bulbs and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This light is the same strength as the salons using the 4 bulbs</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I used this light for the second time today.</li>
            <li> Big, light weight</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> I buy all my supplies with tip money from work which isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> so the light reaches all fingers), and lastly bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend too much, but I wanted the lamp to work.</li>
            <li> and I really hope it is</li>
            <li> It arrived fast within two days to KS (prime member)</li>
            <li> I can take the good with the bad to have nails that look nice for a much longer time.</li>
            <li> the the delivery time was good but the quality of the product was very poor, and it was damage, I rather spend a few more dollars and have a better product</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally do them.</li>
            <li> I have taken care of this item from day 1,I store in my closet after I know the bulbs had cooled, in original box and only used once a month,no drops or spills etc.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li> The dryer does dry the gel within two minutes and its also veryyyy easy to set up (install the bulbs) and plug it in</li>
            <li> Bulbs do not remove easily to replace (had to open up bottom completely).</li>
            <li> The light bulbs would constantly be falling out since they weren&#x27;t as secure as other lamps.</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of UV lights online and did not want to spend a lot of money, yet wanted a decent lamp.  </li>
            <li> Overall would recommend, but only if you&#x27;re ok with changing the cord out.</li>
            <li> I am lucky nothing more serious happened.</li>
            <li> It cures shellac and standard polish quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to over pay to get what I needed.</li>
            <li> Be sure the bulbs snap into place tightly.</li>
            <li> highly urge you to think about not purchasing this item...</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li> I use this for curing UV sensitive glues onto phones and it works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain, but at least the bulbs work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that all 4 turn on at the same time.</li>
            <li> Slide out tray is slick and good size for larger hands.</li>
            <li> While this lamp technically works, you have to jiggle the light bulbs every time you turn it on, and even then only some of the bulbs work.</li>
            <li> This product arrived and was bigger and more sturdy than I expected for the price</li>
            <li> After mixed reviews something told me to just get it because for the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I mean lets be honest a 5 year old could figure out how to operate this machine...,BUT</li>
            <li> The polish would harden but would easily peel off within a couple of days, after I did a little research I discovered</li>
            <li> I  had previously purchased another lamp that was cheaply made and didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This light was half the price.</li>
            <li> Its a huge hassle to return and not worth the risk of them sending you something that you cannot use at all!</li>
            <li> If saving time is a huge concern, I would go with a larger box because there is really only enough room for one hand/foot.  </li>
            <li> I use the timer completely to assure product cures.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I took the power cord off an old lamp, took the bottom off the UV lamp, and swapped cords.  </li>
            <li> I received my professional nail dryer as promised.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at the size.</li>
            <li> One of the bulbs arrived burnt out, but even with replacement this light wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cure the UV polish effectively (not unless you wanted to spend a half hour or so on each hand).</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t have a 10 second timer, it is easy enough just to count down 10 seconds</li>
            <li> However, I appreciated the low cost of this box and don&#x27;t mind taking the extra time.</li>
            <li> One bulb wont light up, then after a few minutes of use it shut off and smoke comes rolling out the back...</li>
            <li> At least for legal purposes from the perspective of the manufacturer, hopefully there are never any malfunctions.&lt;br /&gt;However, with all of that said, for the price as compared to paying $80 every 2 or 3 weeks for a mani will financially be worth it.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star only because the bulb comes loose, other than that the lamp works fine.</li>
            <li> the biggest complaint I have about this purchase was the fact that two of the light bulbs were in a million pieces when I opened the box...</li>
            <li> I left my nails in far longer than the unit required - still no luck.</li>
            <li> some of the smaller UV lights have which of course means MUCH quicker dry time.  </li>
            <li> When I was curing the second coat of gel polish on my clients nails it made a strange crackling noise and before she could remove her hand fast enough it caught on fire.</li>
            <li> And...the kit only comes with the UV lights, a Large stale looking box for the lights (which fit one hand, you could do both if you stacked your hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a few minutes I had the lamp turned on and the timer button worked just the first time and thereafter not again.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how much smoke came out of this little machine and blowing the back out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large enough to cure either a hand or foot but small enough to store or travel with.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t take as long if I use regular UV gel and not the builder type.</li>
            <li> ; deep by 6&amp;#34; wide by a little over 2&amp;#34; high.  </li>
            <li> I tried it several times but it doesn&#x27;t dry the nails</li>
            <li> Only issue I have is how loose the bulbs are on the inside of the lamp.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry your nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails never would dry using this...even after about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li> It turns out I just hadn&#x27;t pushed them in far enough because I was afraid of applying too much force</li>
            <li> Thought maybe one of the bulbs was loose, so I was going to remove them and try again, but while doing so, one of the bulb caps snapped off and stayed in the machine - had to use a needle nose pliers to remove.  </li>
            <li> One always comes loose on mine, but once I tighten it, it stays put.</li>
            <li> This was the only assembly required and it took less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> In regards to a previous post, the plug works as it should in an American outlet, you do not need an adapter if your in the states.</li>
            <li> I used this lamp less than ten times before it caught on fire while I was using it.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap bad product.</li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t worry about giving them a little extra push).  </li>
            <li> It is so much bigger than the little lamps at the salons and</li>
            <li> Is a little larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Made a huge popping noise and smoked like crazy.</li>
            <li> It did not work, my nails were still wet.</li>
            <li> This definitely works but I am too impatient for the 2 minute wait time.</li>
            <li> Considered sending it back, but was just too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Be patient when doing Gel Manicures, and always read the polish&#x27;s drying instructions ( dark colors take longer to dry) if you do that, and use this lamp you are set.</li>
            <li> Some people say that this is not strong enough to cure Shellac polish</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago and it showed up on my doorstep less than 5 days later.</li>
            <li> You can use the 2 minute lamp or use it the other for longer periods of time.  </li>
            <li> The other uv lamps where extremely overpriced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently I am not able to return this item or receive my money back.</li>
            <li> this was due to a lack in the &#x27;curing&#x27; process.</li>
            <li> This lamp doesn&#x27;t even cure gel nails as well as other lamps, the color wipes off when you remove the sticky layer at the end</li>
            <li> Beware people if you can get it from any other company, do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other types of gel yet</li>
            <li> Today was the second time using this cheap piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done eventually and works especially well when used in conjunction with regular nail polish, but it takes about 6-8 minutes to cure a thin coat of UV builder gel.</li>
            <li> I just hope all of the lamps work and last for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> be firm but careful installing the lights.</li>
            <li> Timer stopped working after a half dozen times</li>
            <li> I can have my nails done in less than 30 minutes and the polish lasts for two to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The lightbulbs had to be pushed in and that made me a little nervous as it felt like they were going to break either the bulb or the unit, of course, neither happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After ordering the lamp and reading the some of the reviews, I was a little worried about buying the product.  </li>
            <li> and I needed it for a wedding party that I was doing in a few days..</li>
            <li> I have a salon and just wanted to do a few of my clients nails</li>
            <li> The 4th did not light up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge issue as I can set a timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t going to mess any further with this questionable product and just set up a return.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little hard to put the bulbs in</li>
            <li> The gellish was too small.</li>
            <li> Had this product for a few months until it shorted out!  </li>
            <li> No more going to the nail salon to get my nails done..</li>
            <li> The dryer didn&#x27;t even blow a fuse it just started smoking and then shut down not good.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, however I would like to say that the marketing for the product is misleading, at least to me</li>
            <li> would recommend this to others despite the timer being broken.</li>
            <li> and it was broken</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it only has 3 working bulbs.</li>
            <li> its kinda sad I can&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> SCARY and please beware.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate part of this lamp is that the timer function does not work.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in and nothing...very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed and have been using it for a couple of months now.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> I received the product this evening and was a bit disappointed in it, cosmetically.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> light bulb keep falling out when store and go to use it dont stap in socket to good to hold it in place</li>
            <li> I tried using this machine to cure my nails once I put shellac on them.  It did not work, my nails were still wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp because I needed it right away and I wanted a lamp that was offered with prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how it works because the OUTLET is not an american outlet. I have no idea what type of outlet it is. Bottom line is i am returning it and AVOID THIS PRODUCT. Its a huge hassle to return and not worth the risk of them sending you something that you cannot use at all!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! Works great! I use the timer completely to assure product cures. Timer stopped working after a half dozen times so I took the bottom off and unplugged the wire clip that went to timer, works great again.  Unplugged like a phone jack. Very easy to reset.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Gelish nail system and it works great.  At first I was concerned that the bulbs weren&#x27;t working because they were flickering.  It turns out I just hadn&#x27;t pushed them in far enough because I was afraid of applying too much force (so don&#x27;t worry about giving them a little extra push).  This was the only assembly required and it took less than 5 minutes.  Now that it&#x27;s up and running  I am able to give myself a great gel manicure whenever I please!  If saving time is a huge concern, I would go with a larger box because there is really only enough room for one hand/foot.  However, I appreciated the low cost of this box and don&#x27;t mind taking the extra time.</li>
            <li> This lamp works at curing my gel nails, but the timer button doesn&#x27;t work. So instead of having it automatically shut off after 90-120 seconds, I have to use a clock to make sure I&#x27;m curing my nails for the right amount of time. Once the time is up, I have to manually turn the light off and on again. Kind of a pain, but at least the bulbs work.</li>
            <li> The dryer didn&#x27;t even blow a fuse it just started smoking and then shut down not good. Now I now why it is so cheep you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I received the product in perfect time. Came quick so I was happy. As soon as I received my Shellac I was so excited to finally do them. I was doing the second coat, the light starts SMOKING! Unplugged it and took the lights out and put them back in and tried it one more time. Made a huge popping noise and smoked like crazy. Literally had to throw it out my front door.</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of UV lights online and did not want to spend a lot of money, yet wanted a decent lamp.  This is it!  This is a simple to assemble by popping in the light bulbs and you are ready to go.  You can use the 2 minute lamp or use it the other for longer periods of time.  No concerns or complaints about it.  It is perfect for home use, I use it for gel &amp; shellac.</li>
            <li> Works great, the 4 lamps are needed to operate, not just as extras. Is a little larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I  love the lamp,  but I thought it had a fan too because it  stated it was a nail dryer...  it doesn&#x27;t. But I still love it.  I  had previously purchased another lamp that was cheaply made and didn&#x27;t work, I  had to return it and chose  this one instead,  and I must say, I  am thrilled the first one was broken  because I  love this one! It&#x27;s sturdier,  and  it works!</li>
            <li> it does the job, but it is made from cheap plastic...the biggest complaint I have about this purchase was the fact that two of the light bulbs were in a million pieces when I opened the box...I found that there was no way to contact the shipper to tell them about thie bulbs and ask for replacement of JUST the bulbs...I would have needed to send the entire unit back and I needed it for a wedding party that I was doing in a few days..so I had to go out and buy bulbs which cost me $25.00...so between the cost of the unit and the cost to replace the bulbs I would have been better off purchasing the light at a Beauty Supply Store and paying the $60.00 they charge for a 36W UV Curing Lite...which would have been a better quality.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this... It just wasnt exactly as I was expecting. It is so much bigger than the little lamps at the salons and the bulbs don&#x27;t like to stay in place. However, it dries my nails. So.... for the great price, I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with the 32 watt UV lamp. It worked perfectly with my CND Shellac products that I bought. The other uv lamps where extremely overpriced. I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles that they where trying to sell. The 120 second timer works perfectly, you just have to ensure that you have the switch on top set to &#x27;timer&#x27;. There are no instructions that come with the lamp, so you have to learn as you go. Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase, would certainly recommend to a friend looking for an inexpensive UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Well, I just had to order a US adapter, since I reside in the US and this thing has a European power cord. I think this should have been mentioned in the product specifications. What a hassle.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this light as the price was great and the reviews were great.  I snapped the bulbs in with an orange stick on the silver part so I didn&#x27;t accidentally break the lights.  Any sturdy yet not metal item would work to do this.  The bottom slides out to allow great access to the bulbs.  This light is the same strength as the salons using the 4 bulbs so it is 35 watts not the 9 watt some of the smaller UV lights have which of course means MUCH quicker dry time.  It has the 2 minute timer and the well where you insert your hand is a very good size. The inside well measures 6&amp;#34; deep by 6&amp;#34; wide by a little over 2&amp;#34; high.  I purchased the gloves separately that will limit any exposure to UV rays to my skin below my nails.  Well worth the money and as good or better than others that are more expensive!</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and this light works perfectly. It cures perfectly too. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I always review products and get others opinion about it. After mixed reviews something told me to just get it because for the price was very reasonable. I absolutely love it. I have a salon and just wanted to do a few of my clients nails and I tell you it works great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice gets the job done, but tans my hands.next time I&#x27;ll get one with a shield so the light stays within the lamp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, I suggest that you don&#x27;t buy this product.  I tried it several times but it doesn&#x27;t dry the nails</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a UV curing lamp.  I bought to cure the glass glue for my phone&#x27;s screen replacement.  It showed up perfect and is big enough to fit a Galaxy note smartphone in!  However, went to plug it in and found that the plug was for asia?  Anyways, I took the power cord off an old lamp, took the bottom off the UV lamp, and swapped cords.  Works fine with nothing else needed.  Overall would recommend, but only if you&#x27;re ok with changing the cord out.</li>
            <li> I decided to give shellac manicures a try so ordered this light basically based on price.  I have not been disappointed and have been using it for a couple of months now.  The buttons for controlling the light and the timer are on the top which I find easy to operate.  While it doesn&#x27;t have a 10 second timer, it is easy enough just to count down 10 seconds so I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it.  It does have a 2 minute timer and then you can also turn the lights on without timing them.  It works very well and I have had no problem with it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I received my professional nail dryer as promised. It arrived in a timely fashion and has met all my expectations. It was appropriately priced, infact in comparing it to the cost of others it was priced well below the others. The dryer has made doing my nails fast and fun!!</li>
            <li> This product gets the job done but the inside layer on one side was peeling upon delivery. I would recommend spending a little more for better quality</li>
            <li> I used this light for the second time today. When I was curing the second coat of gel polish on my clients nails it made a strange crackling noise and before she could remove her hand fast enough it caught on fire. It was smoking and the odor was one of burning plastic or rubber. I am grateful to say she was not burned.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I am not able to return this item or receive my money back. I am so disappointed and probably I have lost a very good client.&lt;br /&gt;I highly urge you to think about not purchasing this item...</li>
            <li> This definitely works but I am too impatient for the 2 minute wait time. Wish I had gotten an LED. Saving up to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these machines for several months now with no issues at all. I liked it so well that I purchased another machine for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will have to let me know what she thinks of this product.  I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> I love my acrylic light, I don&#x27;t need to pay $ 5 dollars extra for the acrylic any more I go to the nail salon do my nail and come home and put my acrylic at home and save</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. The machine is very simple to operate and has salon quality results. Very nice nail dryer.</li>
            <li> It fits one hand, not two. Very disappointed it only has 3 working bulbs. The 4th did not light up. No instruction manual or anything to tell you how to use this product.</li>
            <li> it was one of thebest items that i oder it help me a lot with my classes thank you all very much,it was just what i needed i will be looking forward to odering much more for the new year thank once again.</li>
            <li> I turned it on and after just a couple of minutes, it caught on fire! I had to put it outside! I&#x27;m very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Pkg arrived looking &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; - even more suspect when I opened the taped-up box to find virtually no instruction sheet.  Nothing - just the unit and the bulbs.  Altho easy to figure out, I inserted the bulbs, plugged it in, and the unit would NOT start up.  Thought maybe one of the bulbs was loose, so I was going to remove them and try again, but while doing so, one of the bulb caps snapped off and stayed in the machine - had to use a needle nose pliers to remove.  Wasn&#x27;t going to mess any further with this questionable product and just set up a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a friend&#x27;s machine for awhile, bought this one for myself and if I liked it, I was going to get one for my sister for xmas.  Glad I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> It has a European plug!! If you live in the US and do not already have a converter DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!! You won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at the size. It is larger than it appears in the pictures. Very bright and cures very fast. I use this for curing UV sensitive glues onto phones and it works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Junk! Big, light weight and you have to replug the lights each time you use it. Considered sending it back, but was just too much trouble. You get what you pay for. Truly, a made in China product.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these items for my sister and when we got it it was not working. After contacting the seller about this , they resolved the problem real fast and with ease. Now we got one thats working perfect and my sister is using it often without any problem. So we are 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> One of the bulbs arrived burnt out, but even with replacement this light wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cure the UV polish effectively (not unless you wanted to spend a half hour or so on each hand). The polish would harden but would easily peel off within a couple of days, after I did a little research I discovered this was due to a lack in the &#x27;curing&#x27; process. I left my nails in far longer than the unit required - still no luck.</li>
            <li> The product was cracked on top when I received it.  I planned on returning it but decided to keep it since it worked fine and I didn&#x27;t want to wait for another one.  I have been using it ever since, a couple of months. The crack is very visible but it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed. Very affordable. be firm but careful installing the lights. I do my own nails on a very tight budget. I buy all my supplies with tip money from work which isn&#x27;t much. Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> This was this years practical X-mas gift for the wife and she loves it. Dries her nails in like 5-10 minutes which is way better than the 45 minutes it used to take.</li>
            <li> the the delivery time was good but the quality of the product was very poor, and it was damage, I rather spend a few more dollars and have a better product</li>
            <li> I started with the gellish led light and it quit on me after 7 months. I&#x27;m impressed with this light. The size is great and it cures every nail at once. The gellish was too small. This light was half the price. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Light bulbs literally fall out or won&#x27;t stay lite.  Takes forever to dry your nails.  Looking for a more powerful model.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could start doing my own nails. Today was the second time using this cheap piece of crap. One bulb wont light up, then after a few minutes of use it shut off and smoke comes rolling out the back... Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this flimsy thing.</li>
            <li> All the bulbs are there although I wish it had instructions in the box, there really isn&#x27;t anything more than what is written on the box to explain it. It is also a little bulky, I believe there are other UV lamps for shellac that are a little more sleekly designed.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok.  One bulb doesn&#x27;t want to stay in but finally got it to work.  Will keep it.</li>
            <li> I received the product this evening and was a bit disappointed in it, cosmetically. Although, if you&#x27;re already set on doing your own nails at home who really cares about the appearance of your UV light.  I have not used it yet, however I would like to say that the marketing for the product is misleading, at least to me it was. It appeared as though the kit came with 4 UV lights, as it should, then an additional set as a replacement or complimentary if you will. This is not the case. Only one set, which whatever. In regards to a previous post, the plug works as it should in an American outlet, you do not need an adapter if your in the states. And...the kit only comes with the UV lights, a Large stale looking box for the lights (which fit one hand, you could do both if you stacked your hands so the light reaches all fingers), and lastly bubble wrap. That&#x27;s it. No instructions! I mean lets be honest a 5 year old could figure out how to operate this machine...,BUT an invoice for your purchase or return label should have been included. At least for legal purposes from the perspective of the manufacturer, hopefully there are never any malfunctions.&lt;br /&gt;However, with all of that said, for the price as compared to paying $80 every 2 or 3 weeks for a mani will financially be worth it. I&#x27;ve also used mini curing lamps (sallie hansen) before and decided to make the jump to this one so it would cure faster. I just hope all of the lamps work and last for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I asked for , good price , good quality and super easy to use I really recommend it . It will save you money if you really love doing your nails.</li>
            <li> My nails never would dry using this...even after about 12 minutes. I&#x27;ve never had one so I don&#x27;t know if it was me or the uv light. I gave up trying so it now is out away.</li>
            <li> great product for the price works just as good as a 150 dollar lamp. my bosses broke so she is borrowing mine and hers was hundreds more than this.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie in doing my own Gel Manicure, and shopped around for the best priced lamp. I did not want to spend too much, but I wanted the lamp to work. After some research I decided to go with this one. This lamp works good on my gel manicure. Be sure the bulbs snap into place tightly. One always comes loose on mine, but once I tighten it, it stays put. Be patient when doing Gel Manicures, and always read the polish&#x27;s drying instructions ( dark colors take longer to dry) if you do that, and use this lamp you are set. I give it a 4 star only because the bulb comes loose, other than that the lamp works fine.</li>
            <li> Had this product for a few months until it shorted out!  Lights made a popping noise, sparked, shut off, and then the dryer started smoking.</li>
            <li> This machine works excellent!! Some people say that this is not strong enough to cure Shellac polish but IT IS!!! It only takes 2-3 min. to cure color and top coat! THEN YOU HAVE TO USE RUBBING ALCOHOL TO GET THE STICKY RESIDUE OFF YOUR NAILS! It works amazing and great price!! It was also delivered within a couple days!!</li>
            <li> Its been a little over a month and was pleased with how good it was working till it exploded on me. Would not recommened this product.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all but the only good thing is that I got refunded my money. DO NOT BUY it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. While this lamp technically works, you have to jiggle the light bulbs every time you turn it on, and even then only some of the bulbs work. It&#x27;s rare that all 4 turn on at the same time. Save up your money and invest in a better quality machine. Also, the plug is European so you&#x27;ll need an adapter if you want to use it in the U.S.</li>
            <li> This product arrived and was bigger and more sturdy than I expected for the price (I didn&#x27;t have high expectations though!)&lt;br /&gt;It was well packaged and arrived a day or two earlier than promised (I always like that)&lt;br /&gt;The lightbulbs had to be pushed in and that made me a little nervous as it felt like they were going to break either the bulb or the unit, of course, neither happened.&lt;br /&gt;Within a few minutes I had the lamp turned on and the timer button worked just the first time and thereafter not again. Not a huge issue as I can set a timer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it will work for my purposes ( a beginner to gel nails and never going to be a professional).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others despite the timer being broken.</li>
            <li> Like a professional AV lamp for a better price. It looks smaller in the picture. Great deal. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Thay had a problem with my lamp I contact the vender they take care of the problem they replace my item for a new for free!!!</li>
            <li> Only issue with this lamp is that the timer doesn&#x27;t work.  For the price I paid I can time it myself.</li>
            <li> The product works just like the one inthe nail salon. I like it and would recommend it to anyone looking to do their nails at home or in the salon.</li>
            <li> Just got my UV Nail Lamp delivered . After ordering the lamp and reading the some of the reviews, I was a little worried about buying the product.  I opened the box and put the lights in with no problem. Quick and easy. Plugged the UV Lamp in, lights and timer worked perfectly. Finally, I did my nails and they look GREAT! I would recommend this product. I love it. No more going to the nail salon to get my nails done.. Very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> I received my uv dryer but when I opened it 2 bulbs were broke, how can I get the bulbs replaced?&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try it but its kinda sad I can&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;Help please!!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars, i would. I am 7 months pregnant I do my own gel nails and have since September when I purchased this item. It is January 30 2014 and 4 days ago this item literally blew up in my face. I can not believe how much smoke came out of this little machine and blowing the back out. My right eye was burning and watering for hours. My Dr helped flush my eye out and gave me some drops to help as well. I have taken care of this item from day 1,I store in my closet after I know the bulbs had cooled, in original box and only used once a month,no drops or spills etc. SCARY and please beware. Spend a little more and get something reliable and not dangerous to use. I am lucky nothing more serious happened. Amazon was contacted and I was told this item would be pulled and I really hope it is</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I just got mine in the mail and it was broken the light bulbs keep falling out it raddled and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.so I ordered a new one hope it work&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> I bought this light with my boyfriend&#x27;s account, I am a nail tech and I wanted a light that I could do my own nails at home. I used this lamp less than ten times before it caught on fire while I was using it. The light bulbs would constantly be falling out since they weren&#x27;t as secure as other lamps. This lamp doesn&#x27;t even cure gel nails as well as other lamps, the color wipes off when you remove the sticky layer at the end (the polish is still on just not fully cured). The 120 second timer broke after using it for the third time.  This is a very cheap bad product. If you buy it be warned.</li>
            <li> Worked for the first few days then the lights burt out! The machine started popping and I heard a burring noise and smelled tons of smoke. Literally almost had a HEART ATTACK. Beware people if you can get it from any other company, do. I bought replacement lights just because I figured to give it one more shot...Thing never turned on again.</li>
            <li> Little hard to put the bulbs in but it does the job once in there properly.  Operates well and doesn&#x27;t over heat</li>
            <li> I like the product seems to work fine just received it. Only issue I have is how loose the bulbs are on the inside of the lamp.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping.  Worked perfectly with UV products. Timer cured UV Gel builder with one use using timer (but be sure to use UV gel cleanser to remove excess gel after curing or nail will still feel tacky and not cured).  Overall a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally received a defective item but it was exchanged super quickly. All of my dealings with BrainyTrade were courteous and they seemed to be interested in nothing but pleasing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love my new Uv Gel Curing Lamp and would recommend this product to anyone.  I also commend BrainyTrade on their great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons: Bulbs do not remove easily to replace (had to open up bottom completely).</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great and everything works and the only problem I have is that it Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions how to work it but I found it on YouTube and figure it out but works great</li>
            <li> I Use it all the time, it works great. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. No need to go to the salon again.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast within two days to KS (prime member) I used to go get my gel nails done every two weeks but the cost was adding up so I thought it&#x27;d be smart of me to get the dyer and polishes and do them myself. The dryer does dry the gel within two minutes and its also veryyyy easy to set up (install the bulbs) and plug it in and you&#x27;re done. I would re purchase again if I would ever have too</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail.  It was packaged fine.  I put the bulbs in and it didn&#x27;t work.  I even moved the bulbs around and made sure the were in properly.  Plugged it in and nothing...very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on purchasing this item.  The product came with no directions or manual at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with cnd shellac.  It works great &amp; I would recommend it to anyone else looking to buy a UV light for shellac!</li>
            <li> very happy with it, works well I receive it in two days maybe even one day super great deal, thanks</li>
            <li> I think this lamp is great. The timer switch doesn&#x27;t shut off after the two minutes, but I don&#x27;t mind manually turning it off. My nails look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working perfectly, i love my new lamp ! Also the timer button works great, so i&#x27;m 100% satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it !</li>
            <li> This lamp is not fancy or all that pretty but it gets the job done. I like that it&#x27;s large enough to cure either a hand or foot but small enough to store or travel with. It&#x27;s very light weight and does have a 120 second timer feature or you can use the infinit option. I don&#x27;t regret buying this lamp at all. It cures shellac and standard polish quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to over pay to get what I needed. Awesome product! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago and it showed up on my doorstep less than 5 days later. So, 5 stars there. The 4 bulbs included in the package are easy to put in; you hear an audible click once it fits in to place. The unfortunate part of this lamp is that the timer function does not work. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal though. I just use my own timer. There was some cosmetic damage to the inside of the lamp; the foil in the back left was dented and there were scratches on the back surface and bottom as well. Function wise, I give it a high 2 to low 3 stars. It gets the job done eventually and works especially well when used in conjunction with regular nail polish, but it takes about 6-8 minutes to cure a thin coat of UV builder gel. I haven&#x27;t tried any other types of gel yet but I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t take as long if I use regular UV gel and not the builder type. Overall, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Just maybe not as timely as most would prefer.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly!  And it went together easily.  I can have my nails done in less than 30 minutes and the polish lasts for two to three weeks.  Being UV, this light works with both uv polish and led polish.  Changing polish is not so easy as you need to use acetone and let your nails soak it in to loosen the polish.  I can take the good with the bad to have nails that look nice for a much longer time.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but absolutely no info or instructions... Well made and works great.  Slide out tray is slick and good size for larger hands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but this item looks like it&#x27;s in perfect condition. Turned it on and all the bulbs work. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
