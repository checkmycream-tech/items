            <li>skin has responded great to this soap.</li>
            <li>so is good for the scalp.</li>
            <li>This soap lasts a while and the bar seems to do a good job on persistent acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I sweat a lot my skin requires good moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it, you will love it!</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I believe this soap does a good job to keep my skin as healthy as when I was born.</li>
            <li>My hair liked it more but this one from Syria is also good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as it adapts to your own skin in an earthy and sexy way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this - awesome and cheap.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more bars which should have me set until 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>love love love this soap because it lasts and lasts, it leaves my skin smooth, AND I can use it as shampoo too!</li>
            <li>and I love the laurel for my scalp even though I have no issues.  </li>
            <li>Really love this soap.  </li>
            <li>but it is really better as I am allergic to some fragrance nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now my skin care regimen is this: Syrian soap to cleanse most days, morning and night.</li>
            <li>and I love anything that&#x27;s chemical</li>
            <li>I love olive oil soap--pure olive oil soap and this one scores out of the ballpark.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap because I read some good reviews on amazon, it really works!</li>
            <li>I am having good hair days again for the first time in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No fancy additives, no fancy wrapping, just a GREAT soap product that is far better then anything $$ can purchase</li>
            <li>As a shampoo it does not produce much lather to speak of, which is a good thing as this means there are no sulphates.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so good for your skin and your hair, I highly recommend this soap, will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and when I got out, again my skin felt smooth and lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is awesome and, of course, the soap is perfectly gentle and cleansing at the same time.  </li>
            <li>like the mix of Olive and laurel oils, leaves you clean and is perfectly fine for the hair as well.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite soap and always has been ever since going to the M.E...</li>
            <li>, it may not have the best smell  like some of the finer French or Greek soaps</li>
            <li>While this is  a bit more expensive, it is also the best soap I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did not float and seem to melt quickly.  </li>
            <li>it has lasted SO long and is a really good quality soap.</li>
            <li>These ingredients are boiled in a cauldron until the soapmaker knows the time is right, then poured into molds to cool and cut by hand.</li>
            <li>use a lathering net to maximize the nice lather when showering.  </li>
            <li>Out of the packaging it&#x27;s not as nice smelling as Savon de Marseille, however, I can say that I definitely felt cleaner afterwards with no dryness.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I alternate oils on my face: during the day I use rosehip oil, camellia oil and/or argan oil beneath Gorgeous moisturizer by LUSH.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>That is pretty close to the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did this on my first bar and it splintered apart.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>At first, I did not like the smell of having no frangrance</li>
            <li>This was not anything like my first experience with Syrian Soap.  </li>
            <li>It has a pretty neutral/earthy smell and it&#x27;s neat to see the color change as you go from brown to turquoise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day I recieved it I used it to wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am going to buy it any more if they are charging the same price</li>
            <li>It comes as a large block like in the picture.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>however I have heard in Arab stores you can find them for much cheaper...</li>
            <li>Instead, it left me skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Some soaps contain a much as 45% laurel oil, though I have not seen those sold on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have just two issues which do not matter much</li>
            <li>You might think that because this soap is comprised of olive oil that it would weigh down your hair, but mine was not heavy-feeling, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>good moisturizing for all body soap; lower rating given for lasting ability, considering the high price as compared to other Syrian type olive soaps.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was high for a bar of soap at 200g.  </li>
            <li>I get pimples here and there and was looking for a gentle soap that would help clear up my skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought my first bar about 2.5 months ago, and I probably have another month left on it.</li>
            <li>In addition my skin did not feel or look the same as my first experience with Syrian Soap.</li>
            <li>Just soft, well-conditioned, shiny hair!</li>
            <li>The supplier sells the exact same products you find in Syria.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would be a body only soap</li>
            <li>I am just so enchanted by the positive changes I&#x27;ve seen in my skin and especially my hair that it could smell like goats</li>
            <li>I am just so enchanted by the positive changes I&#x27;ve seen in my skin and especially my hair that it could smell like goats</li>
            <li>and my skin is glowing and totally clear.</li>
            <li>A salt scrub cleanser by LUSH once per week to exfloiate.</li>
            <li>If you are teenaged or in your 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s, you may not even need moisturizer after using this on your face and body.</li>
            <li>It cleaned beautifully and actually did NOT leave my face with that tight, dry feeling that every other soap I&#x27;ve ever used did.</li>
            <li>so the higher the laurel content, the more expensive the soap.</li>
            <li>but it does feel like a natural soap with essential oils intact.</li>
            <li>You can use a good-smelling conditioner after shampoo; I like LUSH American Cream and Morrocan Oil Moisture Mask.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my face and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>This soap isn&#x27;t fancy looking, doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, perfume or anything like that, it is so natural, my son always had problems with his hair, so dry and always with split ends.</li>

            <li> It naturally tones and nourishes the skin especially as it runs down my face while I shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued by Maria&#x27;s assertion that it can be used on hair as I have been having bad hair days for about a month, and the truth is that I nearly ruined my formerly healthy hair over a year ago by using a L&#x27;Oreal hair dye at home.</li>
            <li> Apparently (from what I&#x27;ve read) adding scent to this soap decreases the effectiveness of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thank god I only left it in for half the recommended time before rinsing,</li>
            <li> It is similar to other olive oil soaps that don&#x27;t have additional chemicals added beyond lye.</li>
            <li> Anyway it has been a long haul back from that mess</li>
            <li> I had used a moisturizing masque after shampooing and when I dried my hair, a metamorphosis had taken place: no dry, crackly ends!</li>
            <li> After that they are \\&quot;cured\\&quot; in the sun for about 9 months, changing in color from green to blue-green and finally brown.</li>
            <li> Given the price of this one, I&#x27;d say content is about 12% though I am not absolutely certain of that.</li>
            <li> and this works for me extremely well.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d probably still use it.fectiveness of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> : first is it makes my hair very hard and difficult to comb after shower; and second is it burns my eyes very badly if I open them accidentally while rinsing out.</li>
            <li> You actually probably would need at least 2 bars of this soap in order to have what I received before with 1 bar.  </li>
            <li> I typically buy the soap in Syria.</li>
            <li> Now I have been using it every other day for the past week.</li>
            <li> not insinuating that it smells horrible, but if a perfumey scent is muy importante to you, be aware that one of this soap&#x27;s main ingredients is olive oil.</li>
            <li> But the base of all this is this fantastic Syrian Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have just ordered other CHEAPER soaps with the same ingredients as this can be expensive if you use every day as I do.</li>
            <li> The laurel in this is what gives it the edge over plain olive soap.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not strong and is non offensive.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend giving this a try if you&#x27;re unhappy with whatever you are using now, but seriously, know what the mark up is on this product.</li>
            <li> However, with the recent troubles (so sad) it is a bit difficult to get there.</li>
            <li> The quality of this soap was very poor.  </li>
            <li> To me, it does not smell bad but others may beg to differ.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought my first bar about 2.5 months ago, and I probably have another month left on it. I just ordered 2 more bars which should have me set until 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not insinuating that it smells horrible, but if a perfumey scent is muy importante to you, be aware that one of this soap&#x27;s main ingredients is olive oil. Grab that bottle in your kitchen cupboard and take a big whiff. That is pretty close to the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this soap because it lasts and lasts, it leaves my skin smooth, AND I can use it as shampoo too! It leaves virtually no smell on you so it won&#x27;t counteract with any perfumes you use.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!! DO NOT TRY TO CUT THE BAR INTO SMALLER PIECES. I did this on my first bar and it splintered apart.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Using this olive oil-based soap has not been shown to lower cholesterol levels. So keep taking your meds and eating your oatmeal. lol jk</li>
            <li> it moisturizes my skin very well. Use it on my face as well as my body. Leaves skin silky feeling after use.</li>
            <li> It comes as a large block like in the picture. It is similar to other olive oil soaps that don&#x27;t have additional chemicals added beyond lye. I like it very much, it may not have the best smell  like some of the finer French or Greek soaps but it does feel like a natural soap with essential oils intact. I personally like the smell so I gave it 5 starts.</li>
            <li> The laurel in this is what gives it the edge over plain olive soap.  It naturally tones and nourishes the skin especially as it runs down my face while I shampoo.  It&#x27;s just incredible on hair and I love the laurel for my scalp even though I have no issues.  I&#x27;ve purchased 20.</li>
            <li> Really love this soap.  I have very sensitive skin and this works for me extremely well.  I have gone through a lot of soaps and finally found this one. Haven&#x27;t tried it as shampoo, but use it on face and body.  Absolutely terrific.</li>
            <li> While this is  a bit more expensive, it is also the best soap I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I like the mix of Olive and laurel oils, leaves you clean and is perfectly fine for the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I know this item well, I bought for my husband who loves it.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! But it only last about 3 to 4 weeks. It does not have a strong smell and leaves my skin soft. I get pimples here and there and was looking for a gentle soap that would help clear up my skin and I found this. It will sting if you get it in your eyes but what soap doesn&#x27;t? It doesn&#x27;t dry my face and leaves it soft. The smell is not strong and is non offensive. I have just ordered other CHEAPER soaps with the same ingredients as this can be expensive if you use every day as I do.</li>
            <li> At first, I did not like the smell of having no frangrance but it is really better as I am allergic to some fragrance nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;I use a lathering net to maximize the nice lather when showering.  I use it to shampoo my hair at times when I forget to bring one to the gym. It works well.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite soap and always has been ever since going to the M.E... however... I also can get it for $1.50 from the ethnic store and can afford to buy enough to let it cure for 10 years. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you&#x27;re unhappy with whatever you are using now, but seriously, know what the mark up is on this product.</li>
            <li> This was not anything like my first experience with Syrian Soap.  The quality of this soap was very poor.  It did not float and seem to melt quickly.  In addition my skin did not feel or look the same as my first experience with Syrian Soap.</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t fancy looking, doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, perfume or anything like that, it is so natural, my son always had problems with his hair, so dry and always with split ends. I bought this soap because I read some good reviews on amazon, it really works! it&#x27;s so good for your skin and your hair, I highly recommend this soap, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Out of the packaging it&#x27;s not as nice smelling as Savon de Marseille, however, I can say that I definitely felt cleaner afterwards with no dryness.  You will definitely not regret this purchase however I have heard in Arab stores you can find them for much cheaper...is the quality the same?  That&#x27;s the question.</li>
            <li> good moisturizing for all body soap; lower rating given for lasting ability, considering the high price as compared to other Syrian type olive soaps. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My brother got me this for Christmas and with daily use, I&#x27;m still on the same bar into June- it has lasted SO long and is a really good quality soap. It has a pretty neutral/earthy smell and it&#x27;s neat to see the color change as you go from brown to turquoise. It also eliminates the need for shaving cream in my opinion because it&#x27;s smoothing enough by itself.</li>
            <li> I was looking around for facial cleanser and came across a review by Maria Orfan for this Syrian soap. I put it on my wish list and played around for about a week, putting it in my cart and then taking it out, so on and so forth. Finally I ordered it. I was intrigued by Maria&#x27;s assertion that it can be used on hair as I have been having bad hair days for about a month, and the truth is that I nearly ruined my formerly healthy hair over a year ago by using a L&#x27;Oreal hair dye at home. Thank god I only left it in for half the recommended time before rinsing, otherwise I&#x27;d have come out bald. Anyway it has been a long haul back from that mess and I could kick myself for doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I recieved it I used it to wash my face at night. It cleaned beautifully and actually did NOT leave my face with that tight, dry feeling that every other soap I&#x27;ve ever used did. Instead, it left me skin smooth and moisturized. So I tried it in the shower next day. As a shampoo it does not produce much lather to speak of, which is a good thing as this means there are no sulphates. I washed the rest of me with it and when I got out, again my skin felt smooth and lightly moisturized. I had used a moisturizing masque after shampooing and when I dried my hair, a metamorphosis had taken place: no dry, crackly ends! Just soft, well-conditioned, shiny hair! Now I have been using it every other day for the past week. I don&#x27;t condition every day; just once or twice a week. On days that I do not use the rinse-out conditioner, I just rub about 5-6 drops of argan oil through the ends of my hair and blow-dry. You might think that because this soap is comprised of olive oil that it would weigh down your hair, but mine was not heavy-feeling, and I have very fine hair. I am having good hair days again for the first time in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has responded great to this soap. Now my skin care regimen is this: Syrian soap to cleanse most days, morning and night. Rosewater toner. A salt scrub cleanser by LUSH once per week to exfloiate. I alternate oils on my face: during the day I use rosehip oil, camellia oil and/or argan oil beneath Gorgeous moisturizer by LUSH. At night I use tamanu oil and argan oil beneath NZ Fusion Moon Creme. But the base of all this is this fantastic Syrian Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is not a pretty-smelling soap. To me, it does not smell bad but others may beg to differ. You can use a good-smelling conditioner after shampoo; I like LUSH American Cream and Morrocan Oil Moisture Mask. Also, if you are just switching to all-natural from a preservative and sulphate-laden shampoo, your hair will need time to adjust to it, but stick with it and you will have the healthiest hair you&#x27;ve ever seen. If you are teenaged or in your 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s, you may not even need moisturizer after using this on your face and body. Since I&#x27;m 49 and need all the moisture I can get, I like to use the oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap also contains laurel oil, sea water and pot ash - and that&#x27;s it for ingredients. Laurel oil acts as an antibacterial agent so is good for the scalp. Laurel oil is actually more expensive than olive oil so the higher the laurel content, the more expensive the soap. Given the price of this one, I&#x27;d say content is about 12% though I am not absolutely certain of that. Some soaps contain a much as 45% laurel oil, though I have not seen those sold on amazon. These ingredients are boiled in a cauldron until the soapmaker knows the time is right, then poured into molds to cool and cut by hand. After that they are \\&quot;cured\\&quot; in the sun for about 9 months, changing in color from green to blue-green and finally brown. Then they are stamped, wrapped and sold in markets in Syria...and now in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syrian Soap is one of the best things you can do for your skin and hair. Again, the scent doesn&#x27;t send me; neither does it offend me. Apparently (from what I&#x27;ve read) adding scent to this soap decreases the effectiveness of the other ingredients. But you may not like it if you don&#x27;t like the smell of olives. Some others have compared the smell to rubber tires or automotive grease, but it does not smell like that to me. I am just so enchanted by the positive changes I&#x27;ve seen in my skin and especially my hair that it could smell like goats and I&#x27;d probably still use it.fectiveness of the other ingredients.

            <li> I re-ordered this soap after ordering it once or twice before.  I did not notice that they reduced the size of the bar to 125g and are charging the same price.  It was 200g before.  I thought the price was high for a bar of soap at 200g.  I don&#x27;t think I am going to buy it any more if they are charging the same price but only giving a 125g bar of soap.  You actually probably would need at least 2 bars of this soap in order to have what I received before with 1 bar.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only reason I go back to soap, but too pricy</li>
            <li> This soap lasts a while and the bar seems to do a good job on persistent acne.  I liked it but I am debating on whether or not to buy another bar.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the soap in Syria. However, with the recent troubles (so sad) it is a bit difficult to get there. The supplier sells the exact same products you find in Syria. So the quality is excellent. The smell, texture and skin sensation of the soap is superb. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I sweat a lot my skin requires good moisturizing. I believe this soap does a good job to keep my skin as healthy as when I was born.</li>
            <li> Perfect soap in every ways. No fancy additives, no fancy wrapping, just a GREAT soap product that is far better then anything $$ can purchase anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> This soap is incredible ! I heard about it thru YouTube and I love anything that&#x27;s chemical free so I thought I&#x27;d try it. At first I thought it would be a body only soap but I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for the last 2 weeks and my skin is glowing and totally clear. Highly recommend this - awesome and cheap.</li>
            <li> I love olive oil soap--pure olive oil soap and this one scores out of the ballpark.  If you are a connoisseur of all things olive oil, you&#x27;ll appreciate this one.  The smell of the soap is awesome and, of course, the soap is perfectly gentle and cleansing at the same time.  I love the smell as it adapts to your own skin in an earthy and sexy way.</li>
            <li> I am using it for my hair. I gave up using shampoo a couple of months ago. Before, I used another olive oil soap which I bought from Turkey. My hair liked it more but this one from Syria is also good. I have just two issues which do not matter much: first is it makes my hair very hard and difficult to comb after shower; and second is it burns my eyes very badly if I open them accidentally while rinsing out.</li>
