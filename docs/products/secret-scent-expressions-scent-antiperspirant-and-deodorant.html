            <li>I am a huge &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; person.</li>
            <li>This is my regular deodorant which I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>It is light lavender.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product free as a promotion from the brand, but I assure you I will be buying it from here on out.</li>
            <li>I wasnt brave enough to test the 48 hours tho.</li>

            <li>Great smell, easy dry.  </li>
            <li>This is a new favorite!  </li>
            <li>All the scents are very mild and fresh</li>
            <li>Good price, especially delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any irritation to the formula and it dries rather quick, just not as quick as I am used to.</li>
            <li>I love lavender and was happy when Secret added a gel antiperspirant/deodorant to their line.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, easy to use, light scent,  Has everything a good deoderant can ask for.  </li>
            <li>Well, the secret scent expression its a good product and at the price I get it is better...</li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>really keeps you feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been someone to stay consistent about deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li>It kept me dry and smelling great until I showered the following morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a gel, easy to apply, does not leave white stains on clothing and does not sting when it is  applied to shaved</li>
            <li>The motto of this brand should be \\&quot;Strong enough for a man but made for a woman\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is fabulous, it dries unbelievably fast and ZERO white marks!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>A real odor and perspiration-stopper</li>
            <li>I used to buy this brand then buy that brand and flip flop all over really.</li>
            <li>Most deodorants that claim to be clear totally aren&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ll live with that minor inconvenience because I absolutely love everything else about it.</li>
            <li>I was loyal to as I have always been generally unsatisfied with every brand I try</li>
            <li>I refuse to buy any other product :)</li>
            <li>&gt; All the scents are amazing and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love this product I got it free from secret to try</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have 1 particular brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell of this Secret Scent Expression is pleasant without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry real quickly which is the only drawback as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>A big thanks to BzzAgent for sending me this product to try!!</li>
            <li>Secrets formula dries quick and leaves you feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quick enough that you don&#x27;t feel gross.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant for its scent and clear gel -- less white powder on my clothes!</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and clear so you can use just a little</li>
            <li>This deodorant is crystal clear, no marks, no stains...</li>
            <li>I made it through throwing a birthday party with 13 kids and the whole next day without smelling the tiniest bit funky.</li>
            <li>It is always clear, never ruins clothing</li>
            <li>My only problem in the past has been finding and loving a product only to have it become discontinued.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s clear so won&#x27;t leave white marks.</li>
            <li>I work with young children and am constantly on the go</li>
            <li>He claims it not only glides on easier than Axe but the longevity of sweat protection and smell far surpasses that of his manly one.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re out there, Secret, PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue this :)  </li>
            <li>It feels wet and a little odd at first if your used to using a solid, however it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Clear gel provides long lasting protection even during a workout.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does as it says, leaves no white marks and it does keep me dry.</li>
            <li> This product is also effective for days, I was sick and was taken to the hospital.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant when I was offered this product to review via BZZagent, since any other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve used left me feeling less than dry and sticky under my arms!  </li>
            <li> However it will temporarily stain silk/silk-like fabrics so you have to be careful putting those on.</li>
            <li> No more white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and find subtle white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I probably never would have, because I&#x27;ve tried gels in the past and hated them because they took so long to dry and never seemed to keep me fresh and dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smell, however, and a lot of products make me feel ill or give me headaches.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a little over 4 years.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the gooey liquid.</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of BzzAgent and secret.  </li>
            <li> Secret Ooh-La-La Lavender Deoderant/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated regular sticks of deodorant and roll ons because I always end up hitting my shirt with the roll ons.</li>
            <li> I have worn the Secret Gel for years and never had a problem with it!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast however lives up to its promises!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the scent! It does leave a residue tho.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!  Was hesitant when I was offered this product to review via BZZagent, since any other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve used left me feeling less than dry and sticky under my arms!  Secrets formula dries quick and leaves you feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Cherry and the Lavender scented versions and like them both.  I think I like the Cherry the best.  The product glides on smoothly, smells  wonderful, and protects well. It does not dry real quickly which is the only drawback as far as I am concerned.  But, I&#x27;ll live with that minor inconvenience because I absolutely love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> I love lavender and was happy when Secret added a gel antiperspirant/deodorant to their line.  I am very sensitive to smell, however, and a lot of products make me feel ill or give me headaches.  I was happy to find that this product has a VERY nice lavender smell (gentle without being overpowering) AND it works well!  I work with young children and am constantly on the go - I need something that works - and it works all day - I have never had to reapply.  My only problem in the past has been finding and loving a product only to have it become discontinued.  So, if you&#x27;re out there, Secret, PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue this :)  I also \\&quot;took the plunge\\&quot; and signed up for subscribe &amp; save with this and am paying almost $1.00 less than I would be paying in the stores - LOVE this!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product I got it free from secret to try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It feels wet and a little odd at first if your used to using a solid, however it dries quickly. Clear gel provides long lasting protection even during a workout. Another added bonus is there no transfer onto your clothing. I would recommend this product! Cheers</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant for its scent and clear gel -- less white powder on my clothes! Great deal on amazon when buying in bulk. Costs way more at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, easy to use, light scent,  Has everything a good deoderant can ask for.  The scent is not overpowering and does not stain clothes</li>
            <li> Great scent. Dries quick enough that you don&#x27;t feel gross.</li>
            <li> This is my regular deodorant which I&#x27;m happy with. Good price, especially delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent. I have been using this stuff for many years and I never have to worry about smelling like BO. It lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great scent. That&#x27;s all I use it really keeps you feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works well.  I like the fact that is doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on anything and that I don&#x27;t notice any over powering scent.  It lasts all day and is the only deodorant the use.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ll buy. Goes on nicely and leaves no residue. Effectively blocks sweat. And it&#x27;s clear so won&#x27;t leave white marks. However it will temporarily stain silk/silk-like fabrics so you have to be careful putting those on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year.  I&#x27;ve never been someone to stay consistent about deodorant.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;the smell of this Secret Scent Expression is pleasant without being overbearing.  It is light lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It is a gel, easy to apply, does not leave white stains on clothing and does not sting when it is  applied to shaved pits.&lt;br /&gt;And... IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I have worn the Secret Gel for years and never had a problem with it! This lavender scent is so amazing, coupled with the spray and you are ready to go! So beautiful, lavender is so calming that it&#x27;s the perfect scent to start your day out with. This product is also effective for days, I was sick and was taken to the hospital. Couldn&#x27;t shower after an emergency procedure for a couple of days and no problems!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I LOVE this deodorant. If I hadn&#x27;t been selected by Secret to try it for free I probably never would have, because I&#x27;ve tried gels in the past and hated them because they took so long to dry and never seemed to keep me fresh and dry throughout the day. Secret Outlast however lives up to its promises! It smells great, dries fast, and works the full 48 hours... I tried it over the weekend! I made it through throwing a birthday party with 13 kids and the whole next day without smelling the tiniest bit funky. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a solid. Not thrilled with the gooey liquid. I doesn&#x27;t dry quickly. Now I&#x27;ve got 4 of them.</li>
            <li> product satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this deodorant for so many reasons! Most deodorants that claim to be clear totally aren&#x27;t!  I put it on and find subtle white marks on my clothes. This deodorant is crystal clear, no marks, no stains...no worries!    It smells absolutely delicious! I am not a fan of lavender...I hate the smell! However this smells amazing! Nothing like the floral grandmother smell that I&#x27;m used to! It smells sweet and fruity and I wish i could eat it!  It kept me dry and smelling great until I showered the following morning. It is now my fo to deodorant brand and scent. I will not use anything else,  so please do not discontinue this scent!!    A big thanks to BzzAgent for sending me this product to try!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It goes on really smooth and clear so you can use just a little and I don&#x27;t have to worry about residue getting all over my clothes. It last a long time also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for over 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;-  All the scents are very mild and fresh&lt;br /&gt;- It is always clear, never ruins clothing&lt;br /&gt;- A real odor and perspiration-stopper&lt;br /&gt;- easy to control dispenser&lt;br /&gt;- a great price on Amazon in bulk</li>
            <li> Great purchase will buy again</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is fabulous, it dries unbelievably fast and ZERO white marks!  This is a new favorite!  I received this product free as a promotion from the brand, but I assure you I will be buying it from here on out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a little over 4 years. I&#x27;ve always hated regular sticks of deodorant and roll ons because I always end up hitting my shirt with the roll ons. I used to buy this brand then buy that brand and flip flop all over really. I didn&#x27;t have 1 particular brand I was loyal to as I have always been generally unsatisfied with every brand I try but what can you do? Gotta have underarm deodorant or smell like a barn! I was in a Shoppers Drug mart and saw a vanilla chai scent expressions and it was love at first sniff! I have never used another deodorant since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All the scents are amazing and long lasting. My boyfriend who is an Axe (user) man even uses mine and he&#x27;s not shamed to let me know lol. He claims it not only glides on easier than Axe but the longevity of sweat protection and smell far surpasses that of his manly one. He gripes Axe doesn&#x27;t protect him from odors and sweat the way my lady stick does. That has to tell you something about how great this product is! The motto of this brand should be \\&quot;Strong enough for a man but made for a woman\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 4 thumbs up from this household. I refuse to buy any other product :)It smells great and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> What can one say?  It&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> Well, the secret scent expression its a good product and at the price I get it is better...Very fast service. Good quality too.</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of BzzAgent and secret.  I am now hooked!  I will never be going back to the solid deodorant.  No more white marks on my clothes.  The gel dries quickly and the scent is lovely!</li>
            <li> Love it! I am a huge &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; person. And this scent is divine. Does as it says, leaves no white marks and it does keep me dry. I wasnt brave enough to test the 48 hours tho. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation to the formula and it dries rather quick, just not as quick as I am used to.</li>
            <li> Secret Ooh-La-La Lavender Deoderant/Antipersperpant is really great. Great smell, easy dry.  Great with the body splash of the same sent.  A must buy.</li>
