            <li> Useful product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> We used to buy cheap color and discard it.  Betty allows us to mix only what is needed, and it saves money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Always liked it. It does a really good job and it seems to be perfectly safe.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, and it worked! (Coat with vaseline the parts you don&#x27;t want dye to get on.)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  You get a least 4 applications with this box.</li>
            <li> Works great. At 66, I had turned a ole lady gray &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. Not enticing in the bedroom! This solves that problem. Lasts about a month and you can get three months&#x27; worth applications out of one package. Gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my beard for a more uniform color. It works better than beard Color because it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin near is bad.</li>
            <li> color is too dark, and it does not take very well.  I would not buy it again.It just wasn;t right for me.</li>
            <li> This works well. Does not burn or cause any troubles. Well...things look much better, is the best way of putting it!</li>
            <li> being an older women wanting to cover the gray, this works great. easy application, very little time involved &amp; looks great. love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use it all at once giving you multiple applications for touch ups. love it</li>
            <li> I was not impressed, I used it once and I did not see any difference.  I will not be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> Much more than a few applications.. which is great!! Very (!!) easy to use, no drip at all</li>
            <li> Works really well. No permanent staining on the genital area and no irritation either.  Sure that a lot of women and men will really appreciate how easy it is to cover up a few white hairs...&amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Product is effective.  I mixed a little more than I needed this first time but I will know for next time--definitely will get several applications from this one purchase.</li>
            <li> I chose the five star rating as it covered my grey and made a rich dark brown color. I would definitely use and buy this product again. There was NO skin reaction.  The directions were clear and explanatory.  Who knows, I may try another color!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is great for male body hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I tried regular men&#x27;s mustache color and I broke out in an itchy rash. Thanks Betty!</li>
