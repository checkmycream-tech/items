            <li> The Alphabet parchment is something to wonder about . It is a useful learning chart something that not everyone  will be able to realize in their lifetime .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Mb</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the parchment.  I laminated the poster and placed it in a frame.  It looks great.</li>
            <li> This is not a poster. This is a somewhat pretty piece of 7\\&quot;X11\\&quot; paper with info that can be printed right off of the internet. This is falsely advertised, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> A Witch&#x27;s alphabet...not THE Witches Alphabet. This is called the Theban Alphabet..there are others. I prefer the Seax Wiccan Runes, a new name for the Anglo Saxon runes. Much easier to use  for sigils and place on candles and tools...easier to use for spell work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a poster..and you can go on the internet and get a collection of the different alphabets, for free.</li>

            <li> I really like this poster and found it to be very useful.  However i only gave it four stars because I wish that it would have been a bigger poster instead of a sheet of paper.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as described. Thank you</li>

            <li> Was a little disappointed  it was.put in the box  and got  folded the paper looked  cheap</li>
            <li> I love this parchment because it challenges me to think outside of the norm when casting and writing spells. I often wonder who spoke this language before.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered and I framed it and put on wall.  It looks nice. Good quality parchment.</li>
            <li> Think twice. Every parchment has been wrinkled.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for!! I&#x27;m looking for more just like it as well. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> This is pretty much something one could easily print out themselves. It is in no way a piece of parchment. I am really not happy with the false advertising.</li>

            <li> Next time my wife would like something of this sort, I&#x27;ll save my $5 and print it out at home. There is nothing wrong with the product, and arrived in a timely manner, but it&#x27;s simply unimpressive.</li>
