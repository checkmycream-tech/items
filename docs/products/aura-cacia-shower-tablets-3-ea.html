    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And my bathroom does smell wonderful after my shower.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful for that.  </li>
            <li>They do smell great!!!</li>
            <li>Simply love the scent that comes up from the tablet...and Amazon has the best prices...</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>You put them in the shower and the melt as you take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 3 so good price for 3.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent choice for light aroma.</li>
            <li>how much I loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with making my own from now on.</li>
            <li>At about a dollar a shower, this is a nice indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I had to kick it all around the tub to find a good spot for it to melt (for lack of a better term)</li>
            <li>I have always liked the Aura Cacia product line</li>
            <li>The light bubbling action is pleasant and the aroma is wonderful in a bath.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful, however, the tablets completely dissolve within five minutes.  </li>
            <li>My children love the Aura Cacia lavender bubble bath</li>
            <li>Love the Aura Cacia products but the one in the jar is better than these tablets.</li>
            <li>Kicking it to the corner will release aroma more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike bath salts, the aroma is generated over more time and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these shower tablets.  </li>
            <li>Love them and would recommend.</li>
            <li>: I will not be purchasing these again, I will be searching for another brand as I was not fully satisfied with the Aura Cacia Shower Tablets.</li>
            <li>In a normal sized shower, about three foot by three foot, the aroma fills the shower nicely and works for a good 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When I am healthy I notice the scent and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>pop one of these in the shower and the steam works the scent and really clears up your breathing problems I loved them but cant seem to find them on amazon anymore what happened?</li>
            <li>Strong without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Lavender shower tablets; they are much stronger and slightly more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got them as a $6 special at my member owned food co op</li>
            <li>Well, I actually do enjoy this in the tub.</li>
            <li>Please return this product to your available merchandise</li>
            <li>I really like these tablets a lot (and am glad to have found them here at a much better price than what I&#x27;m used to).  </li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would help clear my sinuses in the shower and smell good too.  </li>
            <li>They work great and last a full shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to turn off the bathroom fan if possible.</li>
            <li>and then it dissolved (better word) much too quickly.</li>
            <li>They dissolve quickly; too quickly.</li>
            <li>A few drops of Eucalyptus oil on a washcloth would have been more effective in clearing my sinuses.</li>
            <li>(In fact, it says right on the package to not use these in a bath.)  </li>
            <li>Vic&#x27;s used to make something similar, but their tablets were intense and did a great job at helping to clear the sinuses.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had found them before I wasted time making my own!  </li>
            <li>After trying several versions of homemade eucalyptus shower disks without much luck, I was thrilled to find these.  </li>
            <li>When I used it at my old aptartment they worked really well, the scent was strong without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>When suffering from a cold/flu (which is when these should be the most handy), the effect is not strong enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Placing the tablet in direct line of the water will release a lot of aroma quickly, and shorten the aromatherapy time.</li>
            <li>but ii isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>I think the key to this product is strong water pressure.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t replace a massage or the pure relaxation of going to a spa, but it is a lot cheaper and comes close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are pretty good for sinus relief, but they make the tub very slick.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while it is nice to have a bit of aromatherapy or spend a little time at a spa.</li>
            <li>They really didn&#x27;t do either.  </li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t much of a replacement at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I were given a free box, I&#x27;d probably use them, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay for them again -- especially not at the price they sell for here on amazon, as well as out in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any therapeutic benefit at all from the Aura Cacia tablets, but they do not really advertise them as a health aid, more as a spa-like treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me they smell the way it smells at my favorite spa, but ends up being a much cheaper way to have a little pampering.  </li>
            <li>Just not very strong but okay and somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li>I have used Aura Cacia oils for years and have come to depend on their high quality</li>
            <li>My shower used to last much longer than the tablet (and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t really linger once the last of it dissolves), but I extended the life of them significantly by putting them all the way at the end of the tub</li>
            <li>give them 4 instead of 5 stars because, like other reviewers have said, they can melt pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>In my new apt, which has considerably less water pressure, the tablets do not dissolve properly.  </li>
            <li>moving to a house in the mountains of New York with hot water that, for some reason, smells like sulfur (they tell me it&#x27;s safe, seriously)</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus is nice and somewhat subtle.</li>
            <li>These shower tablets won&#x27;t cure your cold, but they sure make it more bearable.  </li>
            <li>The smell lasted for a short time and didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my sinus.  </li>
            <li>The directions suggest placing them directly under the stream of water.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help open up my nasal passages or make me feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I work in an odor lab as a professional \\&quot;Sniffer\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;These dissolve completely in water and leave no residue</li>
            <li>I ended up giving them to my friend who moved into my old place.</li>
            <li>It lasted around 4 minutes in the shower without it being in the direct flow of water.</li>
            <li>In a bathtub shower, this would be a lot less noticeable and less effective.</li>
            <li>Would probably work better in a small, single unit shower.  </li>
            <li>It barely smells like eucalyptus when you hold it to your nose.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus is blended with other things and instead of its typical menthol-y smell (which to me is overpowering), the tablets instead have what I would describe as a strong blended herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I found the scent to be very weak and was surprised at how quickly it dissipated.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for when I have a cold, but recommend to anyone who likes the &amp;#34;Spa&amp;#34; environment.  </li>
            <li> ok if you had a cold, if you used 3 of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> used SudaCare shower tablets a long time ago and promptly forgot about them and</li>
            <li> I do find that if I add a few extra drops of essential oil to each tablet just before use it helps.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not very intense.  </li>
            <li> So I tried the Aura Cacia Eucalyptus which, at almost $17 for a total of nine tablets, seemed a little high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this product was a huge disappointment to me.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia has other products for the tub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These do not compare to the SudaCare tablets in any way other than that they are both shower tablets.</li>
            <li> There is hardly a scent, even with two tablets, it doesn&#x27;t last long either, to me its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus fragrance is not very strong compared to their other products.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what you pay - not worth it at all.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t awful, but they aren&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Placing these tablets near the drain is also not a great idea; water flowing down the drain will pull the aroma down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item does nothing in your shower but dissolve down the drain.  </li>
            <li> They also have seemed to make the tub slightly slicker after their use, so if I use one now, I wipe the tub floor down.</li>
            <li> (Dang, that DOES sound bad, doesn&#x27;t it?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make a long story longer than it should be, I can&#x27;t find the SudaCare tablets anywhere without having to give up at least one body part to pay the exorbitant price the sellers want for them.</li>
            <li> Just drop one in a hot steamy shower and get the benefits of eucalyptus for your cold.</li>
            <li> but even that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are pretty expensive, so I use them only during allergy season or if I have a cold.  </li>
            <li> a cold is just a cold and doesn&#x27;t develop into something much more debilitating.</li>
            <li> I usually place the tab over the drain.  </li>
            <li> format these are sold in was confusing to me.</li>
            <li> that said, I am definitely buying again because DANG that water stinks.</li>
            <li> Very helpful if you have a bad cold or clogged sinuses.  </li>
            <li> If you have a cold or flu, I would recommend using all 3 of them to get the effect that you will probably want because it is not very strong</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to rating scents on strength and intensity and these discs failed on both accounts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t seem to make them anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is a mediocre substitute for that product.  </li>
            <li> Clears my sinus&#x27; and seems to have conquered my tendency to have a cold turn into bronchitis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell was very faint; but was still there.  </li>
            <li> very very very faint scent.</li>
            <li> I wound up using 3 tablets for some relief from awful congestion.  </li>
            <li> The scent did cover up that nasty rotten egg smell, and for that I was grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use them in my shower all the time...Simply love the scent that comes up from the tablet...and Amazon has the best prices...</li>
            <li> I really like these tablets a lot (and am glad to have found them here at a much better price than what I&#x27;m used to).  To me they smell the way it smells at my favorite spa, but ends up being a much cheaper way to have a little pampering.  Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s essentially the same thing as using scented bath salts, but designed for use in the shower instead.  (In fact, it says right on the package to not use these in a bath.)  The eucalyptus is blended with other things and instead of its typical menthol-y smell (which to me is overpowering), the tablets instead have what I would describe as a strong blended herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give them 4 instead of 5 stars because, like other reviewers have said, they can melt pretty quickly.  My shower used to last much longer than the tablet (and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t really linger once the last of it dissolves), but I extended the life of them significantly by putting them all the way at the end of the tub so they get sprinkled but not deluged by the shower spray.  They also have seemed to make the tub slightly slicker after their use, so if I use one now, I wipe the tub floor down.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would help clear my sinuses in the shower and smell good too.  They really didn&#x27;t do either.  The smell lasted for a short time and didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my sinus.  Would I buy them again - no.</li>
            <li> My children love the Aura Cacia lavender bubble bath so I decided to try these as a treat for myself.  They are wonderful, however, the tablets completely dissolve within five minutes.  The directions suggest placing them directly under the stream of water.  I usually place the tab over the drain.  That does seem to prolong the life of the tab just a bit.  And my bathroom does smell wonderful after my shower.</li>
            <li> Smells good but ii isn&#x27;t strong enough for me. It didn&#x27;t really help open up my nasal passages or make me feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good for sinus relief, but they make the tub very slick. I slipped and fell on it.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for when I have a cold, but recommend to anyone who likes the &amp;#34;Spa&amp;#34; environment.  Strong without being overpowering.  Just big enough for the 1 shower.  Clears my sinus&#x27; and seems to have conquered my tendency to have a cold turn into bronchitis.  Since I started using these...a cold is just a cold and doesn&#x27;t develop into something much more debilitating.</li>
            <li> I have used Aura Cacia oils for years and have come to depend on their high quality but this product was a huge disappointment to me. I found the scent to be very weak and was surprised at how quickly it dissipated. I work in an odor lab as a professional \\&quot;Sniffer\\&quot; so I&#x27;m used to rating scents on strength and intensity and these discs failed on both accounts. A few drops of Eucalyptus oil on a washcloth would have been more effective in clearing my sinuses. I&#x27;m glad I got them as a $6 special at my member owned food co op but even that was a waste of money. I&#x27;ll stick with making my own from now on.</li>
            <li> Though I used these tablets, I won&#x27;t be buying them again.  I used them as a replacement for the discontinued \\&quot;Shower Soothers,\\&quot; but they weren&#x27;t much of a replacement at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was very faint; but was still there.  If I were given a free box, I&#x27;d probably use them, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay for them again -- especially not at the price they sell for here on amazon, as well as out in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ho-hum recommendation.  They aren&#x27;t awful, but they aren&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Love the Aura Cacia products but the one in the jar is better than these tablets. You put them in the shower and the melt as you take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 3 so good price for 3.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while it is nice to have a bit of aromatherapy or spend a little time at a spa. This doesn&#x27;t replace a massage or the pure relaxation of going to a spa, but it is a lot cheaper and comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are essentially big Alka Seltzer tablets with essential oils, and without the aspirin. The eucalyptus is nice and somewhat subtle. The effect in the shower is not massive or overpowering. This is an excellent choice for light aroma. I have tried the Lavender shower tablets; they are much stronger and slightly more effective. I prefer the lavender tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablet goes in the floor of the shower. In a normal sized shower, about three foot by three foot, the aroma fills the shower nicely and works for a good 10 minutes. In a bathtub shower, this would be a lot less noticeable and less effective. It&#x27;s a good idea to turn off the bathroom fan if possible. Placing these tablets near the drain is also not a great idea; water flowing down the drain will pull the aroma down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placing the tablet in direct line of the water will release a lot of aroma quickly, and shorten the aromatherapy time. Kicking it to the corner will release aroma more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dissolve completely in water and leave no residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the box says not for use in the bathtub. Aura Cacia has other products for the tub. Well, I actually do enjoy this in the tub. The light bubbling action is pleasant and the aroma is wonderful in a bath. Unlike bath salts, the aroma is generated over more time and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The format these are sold in was confusing to me. In the end, I purchased the three pack - that was three boxes of three tablets each, for a total of nine tablets. At about a dollar a shower, this is a nice indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0029EQ9PU Shower Tablets Relaxing Lavender 3 Packets]]</li>
            <li> These shower tablets won&#x27;t cure your cold, but they sure make it more bearable.  Just drop one in a hot steamy shower and get the benefits of eucalyptus for your cold.</li>
            <li> These do give off vapors but I wouldn&#x27;t say a eucalyptis steam-like spa is created.  I wound up using 3 tablets for some relief from awful congestion.  I used in a bathtub shower with shower curtain.  Would probably work better in a small, single unit shower.  Just not very strong but okay and somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the EUCALYPTUS, instead I got Lavender.</li>
            <li> There is hardly a scent, even with two tablets, it doesn&#x27;t last long either, to me its a waste of money. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I think the key to this product is strong water pressure.  When I used it at my old aptartment they worked really well, the scent was strong without being overpowering. In my new apt, which has considerably less water pressure, the tablets do not dissolve properly.  I ended up giving them to my friend who moved into my old place.</li>
            <li> This item does nothing in your shower but dissolve down the drain.  It barely smells like eucalyptus when you hold it to your nose.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not very intense.  When I am healthy I notice the scent and enjoy it.  When suffering from a cold/flu (which is when these should be the most handy), the effect is not strong enough.  Vic&#x27;s used to make something similar, but their tablets were intense and did a great job at helping to clear the sinuses.  Unfortunately they don&#x27;t seem to make them anymore.  This is a mediocre substitute for that product.  I do find that if I add a few extra drops of essential oil to each tablet just before use it helps.</li>
            <li> I love these shower tablets.  They are pretty expensive, so I use them only during allergy season or if I have a cold.  They are wonderful for that.  I keep them stocked for sneezy times.  They do smell great!!!</li>
            <li> all stopped up? pop one of these in the shower and the steam works the scent and really clears up your breathing problems I loved them but cant seem to find them on amazon anymore what happened? Please return this product to your available merchandise</li>
            <li> After trying several versions of homemade eucalyptus shower disks without much luck, I was thrilled to find these.  They work great and last a full shower.  Wish I had found them before I wasted time making my own!  Love them and would recommend.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m giving it a &#x27;3&#x27; which, in my opinion, is average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used SudaCare shower tablets a long time ago and promptly forgot about them and how much I loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon moving to a house in the mountains of New York with hot water that, for some reason, smells like sulfur (they tell me it&#x27;s safe, seriously) I remembered those tablets and decided to buy some so I could shower without grossing myself out. (Dang, that DOES sound bad, doesn&#x27;t it?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make a long story longer than it should be, I can&#x27;t find the SudaCare tablets anywhere without having to give up at least one body part to pay the exorbitant price the sellers want for them. So I tried the Aura Cacia Eucalyptus which, at almost $17 for a total of nine tablets, seemed a little high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they get here, I jump in the shower and toss one of them on the floor of the tub. And it does... nothing. I had to kick it all around the tub to find a good spot for it to melt (for lack of a better term) and then it dissolved (better word) much too quickly. The scent did cover up that nasty rotten egg smell, and for that I was grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not compare to the SudaCare tablets in any way other than that they are both shower tablets. I didn&#x27;t find any therapeutic benefit at all from the Aura Cacia tablets, but they do not really advertise them as a health aid, more as a spa-like treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I am definitely buying again because DANG that water stinks.</li>
            <li> Drop one of these on the floor of the shower and breathe!  Very helpful if you have a bad cold or clogged sinuses.  I just wish they lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Aura Cacia product line so I thought that I would try their shower tablets after seeing them in the store. You are suppose to unwrap them and place them on the shower floor and allow the shower water run over the tablets and allow it to bring the aromatherapy scent into the air. If you have a cold or flu, I would recommend using all 3 of them to get the effect that you will probably want because it is not very strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- I think these would work ok if you had a cold, if you used 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;- They do take a while to dissolve, but the fragrance goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The eucalyptus fragrance is not very strong compared to their other products.&lt;br /&gt;- The fragrance does not last very long. It lasted around 4 minutes in the shower without it being in the direct flow of water. The tablet lasted around 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I will not be purchasing these again, I will be searching for another brand as I was not fully satisfied with the Aura Cacia Shower Tablets.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace my Sudacare Shower Soothers. This was so not it, it did nothing but make my nose tingle a litte but nothing else</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what you pay - not worth it at all.  I read about the Shower Tablets in a magazine and thought - that&#x27;s for me.  They dissolve quickly; too quickly. very very very faint scent. they are not a substitute for a spa.</li>
            <li> When I purchaced this item the page showed 3boxes with the tablets ,not just one box with 3 pkges is what I got ,I payed 20dollars and some cents for 3 tiny pkgs in one box .</li>
