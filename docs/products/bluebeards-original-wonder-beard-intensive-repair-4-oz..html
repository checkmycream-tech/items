            <li>stuff is the best out of the 3 products, but it STILL doesn&#x27;t get it as soft as my wife&#x27;s salon bought REGULAR conditioner...</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping my beard from cracking and getting split ends in the dry weather of Colorado.</li>
            <li>Like the other Bluebeards products, it smells nice and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>This is pure marketing and nothing more.  </li>

            <li>Pleasant smelling but a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>Get a 3 minute hair repair product at Walmart, they work very very well n beards.</li>

            <li>Does exactly as it&#x27;s advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>This was my first beard moisturizer/softener.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wonder Beard Repair for several months now and I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help me prepare for my first beard competition.</li>
            <li>On the first usage, I could tell that the product was working.</li>
            <li>Did not see that this worked any better or differently than any inexpensive hair conditioner that I have put in my beard.</li>
            <li>(I did it 3 times the first week...</li>
            <li>Straightens and softens ALL hairs ;-)</li>
            <li>I also work outside most of the time, even in single-digit weather.</li>
            <li>I also just started growing it out for the first time a couple months ago, so I was discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good heavy duty beard conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a very noticeable difference in the feeling of my beard, but I am sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt to do such conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>According to my wife, this really did make my beard softer, not just my perception.</li>
            <li>Mine is very abrasive feeling</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks, I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>My beard has been much softer and easier to manage as a result.</li>
            <li>Leave it in for a few minutes and it softens my beard quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>It softens your beard but not to soft just right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Maybe my beard is particularly, irreparably, course.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend</li>
            <li>I tried a few different brands of balm and oils, and they&#x27;ve all had great affects but Bluebeard&#x27;s products are the only ones that blew me away.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard very soft all day.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old.  </li>
            <li>Been using Bluebeards products for over a year, and my beard has been soft and manageable since then.</li>
            <li>A bit spendy, but so far has lasted over a month and not 1/4 used up yet.</li>
            <li>Really helps put moisture back into my beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much more on hair products with much less benefit.</li>
            <li>After growing my beard out for awhile, I noticed that it was getting pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Not really sure this is any different than any other hair conditioner, but it does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>my beard was bad), and now my beard looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>My beard feels generally softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>basically a deep conditioning rinse, but does leave my beard soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I do not see a major difference between using this product and regular hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>At roughly $18 my expectations may have been set too high.</li>
            <li>This product applied twice a week made my beard feel soft, manageable and after using this I could run a comb through it first try with hardly any snagging at all.</li>

            <li> This product applied twice a week made my beard feel soft, manageable and after using this I could run a comb through it first try with hardly any snagging at all.</li>
            <li> My beard is about 6 inches long and a small amount of this works for my whole beard.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because although beard oil has helped my beard, it didn&#x27;t make the huge difference I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I expected to much, so that&#x27;s why I rate the product as &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> But, it seems to help keep the dry beard away.</li>
            <li> This added up to make my beard extremely dry, corse and stringy-looking.</li>
            <li> Only reason not 5 stars, I personally can&#x27;t justify cost for the small amount.</li>
            <li> Dont worry about the prouct&#x27;s size, mine last me a little over two months.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, a very small amount, maybe the size of a standard pencil eraser or less.  </li>
            <li> could they ask that price for such a small tube if it didn&#x27;t work?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t likely to be for at least six months</li>
            <li> The gray hairs seem to be less kinky...</li>
            <li> Smells slightly like peaches to me.  </li>
            <li> See, I&#x27;m Irish/Italian and my beard is extremely curly like an Irishman but VERY thick like an Italian.</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a week as prescribed, smell is a little &amp;#34;doctors office chemical&amp;#34; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Bluebeard&#x27;s product in the past, so I did some research on any product that would help soften and repair the hair.</li>
            <li> Just a conditioner, very average</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my beard.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> it.it&#x27;s not an everyday conditioner</li>
            <li> While it did provide a little softening, my beard was still quite stiff.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on the stiff and wirey hair of beards.  </li>
            <li> Helps the wirey beards feel less stiff and a lot softer!  </li>
            <li> While it is difficult for me to process this fact, even now, much less what this means in terms of physical changes to my body, I recognize that at my age, my beard will probably not be what it once was.</li>
            <li> I wanted to maximize what I have...soften it up a bit, get it to look less dull.  </li>
            <li> Leaves very little if any scent on the hair.  </li>
            <li> No more split ends and helps shape ur beard to a smoother look</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> Either way, this product performed no better than a 24oz bottle of TreSemme conditioner, which costs about 30% the price of Bluebeard&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> small size for the price.</li>
            <li> Very few men&#x27;s products stand out from the crowd.  </li>
            <li> Actuall expensive when you figure out how few uses you get out of a tube.</li>
            <li> And, it was expensive, which is always a lure for those in search of performance.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my son in law at Christmas and he is completely obsessed with his beard.  </li>
            <li> My wife, who was initially skeptical, now appreciates the product based on the results.</li>

            <li> It was an exceptional product that took all the stiffness out of my beard. Additionally, it stays in for about five days just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Like the other Bluebeards products, it smells nice and feels nice.  It softens briefly.  I don&#x27;t see a very noticeable difference in the feeling of my beard, but I am sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt to do such conditioning.  Perhaps over time it will soften even more.  It adds an extra step to maintaining a nice beard, but I am okay with that.  I have the time.  I</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my beard.  The gray hairs seem to be less kinky...</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Product works great as in conditioning damaged hair. No more split ends and helps shape ur beard to a smoother look</li>
            <li> Great for a beard that needs some taming.</li>
            <li> Just a conditioner, very average</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it&#x27;s advertised to do.  The scent is very masculine with ample amount in this bottle for a good long run.  I have received complinments</li>
            <li> Works well, my beard is def. smoother, more hydrated after but the day after I don&#x27;t feel much difference.  I use it 2x a week as prescribed, smell is a little &amp;#34;doctors office chemical&amp;#34; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Just use a good hair conditioner.  This is pure marketing and nothing more.  And its not even very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! It has a great scent, and makes his beard soft and easy to manage. Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Works great using only once or twice per week.  Leaves goatee and mustache soft and feeling great.  Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it now for awhile and am very satisfied with the product.  It lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Smells slightly like peaches to me.  Only reason not 5 stars, I personally can&#x27;t justify cost for the small amount.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard moisturizer/softener.  While it did provide a little softening, my beard was still quite stiff.  I&#x27;m not sure if I expected to much, so that&#x27;s why I rate the product as &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s verry well. I recommend it.it&#x27;s not an everyday conditioner so use it sparingly. Well worth the money. Good stuff</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this really did make my beard softer, not just my perception. Nice to find a product that is not just hype.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money! Get a 3 minute hair repair product at Walmart, they work very very well n beards. Mine is very abrasive feeling so I use th 3 minute repair products, and leave in conditioners. Makes my beard very soft all day.</li>
            <li> At roughly $18 my expectations may have been set too high. Maybe my beard is particularly, irreparably, course. Either way, this product performed no better than a 24oz bottle of TreSemme conditioner, which costs about 30% the price of Bluebeard&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> basically a deep conditioning rinse, but does leave my beard soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works well. small size for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wonder Beard Repair for several months now and I am really pleased. My beard feels generally softer and healthier. I&#x27;ve spent much more on hair products with much less benefit.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old.  While it is difficult for me to process this fact, even now, much less what this means in terms of physical changes to my body, I recognize that at my age, my beard will probably not be what it once was. It is streaked with gray and white, and it is a bit wiry.....having said that, it covers my full face where I want beard, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted to maximize what I have...soften it up a bit, get it to look less dull.  This product seemed to have the attributes I wanted.  And, it was expensive, which is always a lure for those in search of performance.  \\&quot;How could they ask that price for such a small tube if it didn&#x27;t work?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they can.  I get much better results with a light application of my wife&#x27;s mid-range hair conditioner.  Save your money. End of story.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help me prepare for my first beard competition. And it did not disappoint! My beard is about 6 inches long and a small amount of this works for my whole beard. It makes your facial hair softer, smoother, and smelling great. I use it twice a week after using Bluebeards Original beard wash.</li>
            <li> Great beard conditioner!  Helps the wirey beards feel less stiff and a lot softer!  Great man-gift!  I bought the beard wash and a comb with this as well and it made a great set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff. Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit expensive. But, it seems to help keep the dry beard away. I&#x27;m hooked &amp; use this with the Bluebeards Extra Conditioning Wash.</li>
            <li> Come on!!!  I bought all three products...the leave in stuff, the white bottled conditioning shampoo, and this 3 minute &#x27;miracle&#x27; stuff....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the best out of the 3 products, but it STILL doesn&#x27;t get it as soft as my wife&#x27;s salon bought REGULAR conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what you get in a bottle, save your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who fidgets with his beard a lot and it has repaired some split ends he was getting and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Dope! Def need to buy myself some more of this, great product it works well! Once it runs out I&#x27;m getting another one</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this and found it. I use the daily cream as well as this. Used once a week, it worked right away</li>
            <li> On the first usage, I could tell that the product was working. Used it a couple of times already and I can see a difference in reduction of split ends in my beard.</li>
            <li> Did not see that this worked any better or differently than any inexpensive hair conditioner that I have put in my beard. Actuall expensive when you figure out how few uses you get out of a tube.</li>
            <li> Been using Bluebeards products for over a year, and my beard has been soft and manageable since then.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling but a little on the pricey side. I do not see a major difference between using this product and regular hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, a very small amount, maybe the size of a standard pencil eraser or less.  Leave it in for a few minutes and it softens my beard quite nicely.  Leaves very little if any scent on the hair.  A bit spendy, but so far has lasted over a month and not 1/4 used up yet.</li>
            <li> I like this prouduct it has a nice lime scent, and keeps your beard nice and soft. this makes it easer to comb though your beard and  it also moisturizes your beard for some time and gives it a nice sheen over time. I would recomend, Dont worry about the prouct&#x27;s size, mine last me a little over two months.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for my son in law at Christmas and he is completely obsessed with his beard.  HE Absolutely loves it !!</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of the curl outta the beard and makes it way more manageable and soft! You&#x27;ll want to use it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> After growing my beard out for awhile, I noticed that it was getting pretty rough. I&#x27;ve used other Bluebeard&#x27;s product in the past, so I did some research on any product that would help soften and repair the hair. I decided on this one, and after I got over the price, I decided to order it. It works amazing! After a couple weeks, I really noticed the difference. I use it twice a week (I did it 3 times the first week...my beard was bad), and now my beard looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and it actually worked to soften my beard. Good size and value. I&#x27;ll buy this one again when I run out but that isn&#x27;t likely to be for at least six months</li>
            <li> I started using this product in September. I apply it two or three times a week in the shower. My beard has never been more manageable. The scent is mild and I am very pleased with the results I get with Bluebeard products.</li>
            <li> Really helps put moisture back into my beard. I use this about once a week, though I believe it recommends something like every 3 days. Works great for keeping my beard from cracking and getting split ends in the dry weather of Colorado.</li>
            <li> Really good heavy duty beard conditioner. Can&#x27;t live without it! Bluebeards Original makes the best products on the market. If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Straightens and softens ALL hairs ;-)</li>
            <li> Not really sure this is any different than any other hair conditioner, but it does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on the stiff and wirey hair of beards.  Softens and conditions, making my beard much more manageable.  My wife, who was initially skeptical, now appreciates the product based on the results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I was skeptical because although beard oil has helped my beard, it didn&#x27;t make the huge difference I wanted. See, I&#x27;m Irish/Italian and my beard is extremely curly like an Irishman but VERY thick like an Italian. I also work outside most of the time, even in single-digit weather. This added up to make my beard extremely dry, corse and stringy-looking. I also just started growing it out for the first time a couple months ago, so I was discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product applied twice a week made my beard feel soft, manageable and after using this I could run a comb through it first try with hardly any snagging at all. I was amazed. And over time, the affects last longer and longer. This, combined with Bluebeards beard balm made my beard MUCH more manageable. I tried a few different brands of balm and oils, and they&#x27;ve all had great affects but Bluebeard&#x27;s products are the only ones that blew me away. If your beard needs saved and you don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any hope, step away from the clippers man and try this product for a couple weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Bluebeards Original Wonder Beard Treatment a couple times now and I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen. My beard has been much softer and easier to manage as a result.</li>
            <li> It does the job as stated.  I use it on days before I trim and groom my beard as the hairs are softer and easier to clip.</li>
            <li> Very few men&#x27;s products stand out from the crowd.  This is one.  I&#x27;d highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it, and I&#x27;ll purchase it again. It softens your beard but not to soft just right.</li>
            <li> Makes beard hair feel softer, which is a plus!</li>
