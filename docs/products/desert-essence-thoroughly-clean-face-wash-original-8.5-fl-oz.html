    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has a scent that reminds me of the T-Gel shampoo that isn&#x27;t the greatest, but as soon as I rinse</li>

            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best for removing makeup, but I don&#x27;t blame them because it is a face cleanser, not makeup remover.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash, I&#x27;ve tried everything, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc.</li>

            <li>It makes my face feel so nice and refreshed.</li>

            <li>Smells kind of sagey, works well with My skin</li>
            <li>I think the tea tree oil is really effective in helping to prevent break-outs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so make sure you&#x27;ve got a good moisturizer on hand.</li>
            <li>Feels very clean, good price, bought a refill.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and leaves your face feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin squeeky clean and smells great.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly, smelled fairly nice (as nice as tea tree oil can smell), and lathered surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>but it smells very strong like it will get the job done</li>
            <li>Its very strong and permeating like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>cleanser for my sensitive skin,  perfect.</li>
            <li>This face wash is the purest and most effective wash I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

            <li>I loved the CLEAN feel I had when I washed it off.</li>
            <li>I had a baby 10 months ago and haven&#x27;t been able to be on birth control to control my hormones and acne.</li>
            <li>I have used dozens of cleansers, from dermatologist recommended grocery store brands to top dollar spa lines to all the raging all-natural and organic companies.</li>

            <li>people don&#x27;t like the scent, but I love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter seems pleased.</li>
            <li>and I probably will update this review in a couple weeks to give a more thorough review.</li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>something I would gladly put up with if it worked for me.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with it.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell, because it smells a lot like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>It works great and really clears skin up.</li>
            <li>The tea tree smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>I just LOVE how this face wash cleans and make my face feel.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this wash.  </li>
            <li>so I have to unscrew the top to get the product out.</li>
            <li>With the price of this product, I was hoping for a better bottle design.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better skin ever than before from using this face wash.</li>
            <li>Favorite face wash</li>
            <li>Love this stuff will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, including the SMELL, which I&#x27;ve read is not pleasing to some.</li>
            <li>Well i ordered this because I had been using bar soap and figured a liquid castile soap might be better and cleaner to use.</li>
            <li>Quite nice, makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean, smells nice.</li>
            <li>Now I just use one squirt in my body wash to give it that nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>This soap does get my face very clean</li>
            <li>And my skin feels very clean after.  </li>
            <li>but I grew to love as it lathers up easily.</li>
            <li>*squeaky* clean, literally!</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling squeaky clean, which impressed me!      </li>
            <li>I enjoy it much more than Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree cleanser</li>
            <li>Great price for an all natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face well and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product does have a strong smell (a bit like pine sol), but my skin feel very clean and silky smooth when I wash with it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, clean feel and fragrance</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too strong and this seemed it</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, but it wasn&#x27;t intolerable, nor did it hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>everytime i use it because its odor is soo strong and offensive to my nostrils.</li>
            <li>Ver strong astringent smell.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because I had heard good things about this cleanser, but it just wasn&#x27;t good for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I does a very good job of removing makeup, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry at all.</li>
            <li>The smell of tea tree oil, for those who aren&#x27;t familiar, can probably be compared to how a nail shop has that strong nail polish or acrylic smell that just lingers?</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, but I didn&#x27;t like that it was almost the same consistency as water.</li>
            <li>Traits, important to deal with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I use their night cream moisturizer after this and my skin looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and this face wash is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best facial cleaner I have ever found!</li>
            <li>I had an airbnb guest over and asked how he got the most beautiful skin, he wrote down this bottle</li>
            <li>It foams up so quickly and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>It has all these hippy ingredients like tea tree oil, ginger, awapuhi and chamomile that magically scrape the gunk right off your face.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>But, most face washes are-- especially natural ones!  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to make sure anyone with an allergy as severe as mine was aware of the glycerin.</li>
            <li>The smell is something you have to get used to, it is STRONG like punch you in the face strong those first couple times</li>
            <li>My face never felt soooo clean.</li>
            <li>your skin clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>It made my face feel really clean</li>
            <li>It seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>and My skin feels Extremely clean after using this to wash my face.</li>
            <li>This one DOES THOROUGHLY CLEAN.</li>
            <li>but my face did clear up nicely after I started using it</li>
            <li>This product has my full support.</li>
            <li>Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Good basic face wash for combination skin</li>
            <li>Overall, good value for the price.    </li>
            <li>The pump is a great addition considering the wash is very liquidy which surprised me at first</li>
            <li>Since my preteen years I&#x27;ve sufferered with mild acne on my lower face.</li>
            <li>When I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>Simply the best face wash I have ever tried and will keep it as my daily wash from now on.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne caused by stress</li>
            <li>This has helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>Skin feels really squeaky clean afterwards!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never minded medicinal smelling things, as long as it was good for me, like this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this for a long time, and I loved it, I decided to buy it again, and it clears my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li>The new pump is much better...</li>
            <li>It feels clean, it smells clean, lathers really well.</li>
            <li>Pros: favorite cleanser to clean makeup brushes or makeup in general.</li>
            <li>This face wash has done amazing things for my acne and overall complexion without drying my face out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they fixed it.  </li>
            <li>As an individual with combination/oily skin, I had doubts whether this cleanser would be effective.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep skin clear and is healthy for you.</li>
            <li>Its worth trying</li>
            <li>Totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li>, You only need a tiny bit to wash your face and it works incredible well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used love the natural ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>like it, but it is very watery and does kind of dry my face, but after putting on oil, its fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am super satisfied with the results of this product!</li>
            <li>A great face wash, very harsh if (when) you get it in your eyes, but you&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if it just has that strong of an odor.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and reacts strongly to products I use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the clean feeling but definitely need to use moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>I use this product daily sometimes twice as recommended and it keeps my face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>All natural, and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a month and must say it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love this facial soap.</li>
            <li>It was a bit overpowering at first use</li>
            <li>I know all products don&#x27;t respond the same for everyone, but for me I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell(very Earthy-like dirt or Sandalwood), but it&#x27;s tolerable and very much worth it for the wonders it&#x27;s worked for my skin.</li>
            <li>It will help so much!</li>
            <li>The product has a rather nice smell to it, which I was not expecting considering what other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>Remember to air dry or lightly pat your face with a clean towell.  </li>
            <li>and then I use the desert essence blemish touch stick for any little breakouts, and now I have clean and clear skin :) !</li>
            <li>I love this face wash and have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the wash I followed the directions and gently soaped my face for a minute.  </li>
            <li>I was mislead with this facial wash, I got it because it didn&#x27;t have any strong chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has an incredibly strong smell) as well as the moisturizer (definitely get this if you get the cleansing pads, as the pads take a bit of getting used to, the moisturizer helps).</li>
            <li>My only advice is that I would recommend investing in a good moisturizer because it does tend to dry your face out.</li>
            <li>The product did not burn my eyes or skin and it rinsed perfectly fine and left my skin feeling the absolute cleanest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>I use it just because it really cleans my face</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Priced reasonable for the amount of face wash</li>
            <li>I really like the way it cleans and leaves my skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is very tea tree smelling which I like</li>
            <li>My teanage son uses this nightly and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Relatively gentle, could be drying.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and ingredients in this face wash.  </li>
            <li>and I do really</li>
            <li>I really like the product with the exception of the texture -- or lack thereof.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use it as much as I like</li>
            <li>but I really like the product</li>
            <li>and nothing seemed to really work.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Seller shipped fast and even wrapped the item on case it leaked.</li>
            <li>(Some say it is very watery, which it is</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t matter)</li>
            <li>Really dries out your skin</li>
            <li>I liked this brand enough that I started using it&#x27;s facial cleansing pads (4 stars.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and clean without drying me out or making me oily, better than more expensive &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly going to super shrink your pores, but I think it has improved my complexion and leaves my skin feeling clean but without over drying.  </li>
            <li>Also other products perform better for the price.</li>
            <li>Recently, I discovered I have a severe glycerin allergy, and I was excited to try desert essence castile soap, because I had heard it did not have any glycerin in it, and also did not have hemp like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap.</li>
            <li>After using this and the thoroughly clean facial lotion I don&#x27;t even feel a need to put on foundation, primer, mineral veil or anything.</li>
            <li>I love the limited list of ingredients and the fact that I can identify each (natural) one.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>I love that this wash avoids needless chemicals and does a better job than national brands with millions in marketing to convince consumers to buy.</li>
            <li>My older kids don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS SO BITTER AND STRONG AND LASTED HOURS.</li>
            <li>The high content of tea tree oil seems to be soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>I would like something a little more substantial so that it doesn&#x27;t run out of my hand when I use the pump on the bottle</li>
            <li>It not only cleans my skin but leaves it feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>Tea trea is a natural cleaner and really helps normalize oily skin.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all of the redness, I have noticed a considerable reduction in redness and my skin is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is all natural; there are virtually no toxic chemicals, only essential oils and soap.  </li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk to normal size.....</li>
            <li>feel normal and no longer ashamed to be in public!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I am hoping desert essence plain castile soap will be better.</li>
            <li>Last night I used this face wash for the first time (after dumping another face wash of another brand - that did nothing really for me - down the sink) and I could feel it working right away!</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and have been fighting breakouts since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, the slightest thing can set it off, but I have no issues</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong &amp; masquline but doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that the solution is very runny so it squirts out of the pump and generally gets all over the place except my hands.</li>
            <li>if you have dry skin, this can dry you out more.  </li>
            <li>Once I learned to clean around the eye (and you seriously have to be careful here, don&#x27;t just throw water willy nilly onto your face, better yet use a washcloth)</li>
            <li>Past products I used never quite got that clean feeling and caused too much dryness.</li>
            <li>It always seems to clear my face from acne.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear and cleanses of oils.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural face wash that was gentle enough to use year-round.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is the example of sensitivity, even dermatologists have struggled to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m 52) and this has stopped it completely.  </li>
            <li>This works well to leave my skin soft and not greasy or pealing.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a cleanser that was all natural.</li>
            <li>The face wash feels natural on my skin and clears away all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>Buy at natural grocers if you have one, it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Purchase this product on a wimp because I was searching for a natural face wash.</li>
            <li>and i do have quite sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t break me out even with the highly sensitive skin that I am so blessed to have.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li>This might be all natural and Castile soap, but does it have to smell like desert dust?  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, I would recommend using this once a day</li>
            <li>This is a young man who has taken care of chickens and the smell did not bother him.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong, but just be sure to get the right type.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean without any stinging or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it makes my skin feel soft!!</li>
            <li>My skin went from being covered with pimples, especially my chin area, but now I&#x27;m completely pimple free with only the occasional minor flareup which goes away in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I have stopped buying the over marketed national brands that change their formula quarterly in order to campaign a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula which is actually just a mix of new chemicals.</li>
            <li>Plus, the actual soap is very drying, leaving my mixed skin chapped.</li>
            <li>I know its going to take time for me to see some major changes in my face, but I like the way it makes my face feel after I wash</li>
            <li>I use organic coconut oil as a makeup remover/moisturizer and the desert essence face wash every other day, it really cleans my skin without stripping it!</li>
            <li>Cleans like no other.  </li>
            <li>Definitely reccomend it to people dealing with acne or frequent breakouts!</li>
            <li>It has not caused me to break-out, but it also has not helped clear up my teenage daughters face.  </li>
            <li>My skin goes in cycles and apparently I will continue to have break outs well into my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>All I noticed was that my face wasn&#x27;t red or getting red, my skin felt soft, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>you definitely don&#x27;t want to get the pads if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of natural facial products!)</li>
            <li>I never thought I would get rid of it, and especially not from exclusively using natural products.</li>
            <li>but now I barely notice.</li>
            <li>Because the product is rather thin, it dumps out way more than I need.</li>
            <li>I think this cleanse was primarily for those who wear heavy make up, I DON&#x27;T WEAR MAKE UP AT ALL!!</li>
            <li>If you have normal or dry skin, this is not for you, unless you are going to follow up with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>All in all I would recommend, especially if you have slightly oily skin as it leaves you squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money all all different cleansers&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t read carefully, I ordered the one for oily to normal and should have ordered dry to normal.  </li>
            <li>I spent months trying to find something that worked to get me normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a new empty bottle at a store just to transfer this product to.</li>
            <li>Although I decided to try it after years of attempts with drug store facial cleansers that have done nothing for my skin and I am beyond pleased to say the very least!</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash, I&#x27;ve tried everything, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> So squeaky, smells good.</li>
            <li> but you get a lot for your money so good to go.</li>

            <li> Feels very clean, good price, bought a refill.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and leaves your face feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin squeeky clean and smells great.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly, smelled fairly nice (as nice as tea tree oil can smell), and lathered surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> but it smells very strong like it will get the job done</li>
            <li> Its very strong and permeating like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> cleanser for my sensitive skin,  perfect.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the purest and most effective wash I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

            <li> I loved the CLEAN feel I had when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> I had a baby 10 months ago and haven&#x27;t been able to be on birth control to control my hormones and acne.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of cleansers, from dermatologist recommended grocery store brands to top dollar spa lines to all the raging all-natural and organic companies.</li>

            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> something I would gladly put up with if it worked for me.</li>

            <li> and I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell, because it smells a lot like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> It works great and really clears skin up.</li>
            <li> The tea tree smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li> I just LOVE how this face wash cleans and make my face feel.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this wash.  </li>
            <li> so I have to unscrew the top to get the product out.</li>
            <li> With the price of this product, I was hoping for a better bottle design.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better skin ever than before from using this face wash.</li>
            <li> Favorite face wash</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, including the SMELL, which I&#x27;ve read is not pleasing to some.</li>
            <li> Well i ordered this because I had been using bar soap and figured a liquid castile soap might be better and cleaner to use.</li>
            <li> Quite nice, makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Now I just use one squirt in my body wash to give it that nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> This soap does get my face very clean</li>
            <li> And my skin feels very clean after.  </li>
            <li> but I grew to love as it lathers up easily.</li>
            <li> *squeaky* clean, literally!</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling squeaky clean, which impressed me!      </li>
            <li> I enjoy it much more than Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree cleanser</li>
            <li> Great price for an all natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face well and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product does have a strong smell (a bit like pine sol), but my skin feel very clean and silky smooth when I wash with it.  </li>
            <li> Lovely, clean feel and fragrance</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too strong and this seemed it</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong, but it wasn&#x27;t intolerable, nor did it hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> everytime i use it because its odor is soo strong and offensive to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Ver strong astringent smell.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work because I had heard good things about this cleanser, but it just wasn&#x27;t good for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I does a very good job of removing makeup, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry at all.</li>
            <li> The smell of tea tree oil, for those who aren&#x27;t familiar, can probably be compared to how a nail shop has that strong nail polish or acrylic smell that just lingers?</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, but I didn&#x27;t like that it was almost the same consistency as water.</li>
            <li> Traits, important to deal with oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I use their night cream moisturizer after this and my skin looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and this face wash is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best facial cleaner I have ever found!</li>
            <li> I had an airbnb guest over and asked how he got the most beautiful skin, he wrote down this bottle</li>
            <li> It foams up so quickly and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> It has all these hippy ingredients like tea tree oil, ginger, awapuhi and chamomile that magically scrape the gunk right off your face.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> But, most face washes are-- especially natural ones!  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to make sure anyone with an allergy as severe as mine was aware of the glycerin.</li>
            <li> The smell is something you have to get used to, it is STRONG like punch you in the face strong those first couple times</li>
            <li> My face never felt soooo clean.</li>
            <li> your skin clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It made my face feel really clean</li>
            <li> It seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> and My skin feels Extremely clean after using this to wash my face.</li>
            <li> This one DOES THOROUGHLY CLEAN.</li>
            <li> but my face did clear up nicely after I started using it</li>
            <li> This product has my full support.</li>
            <li> Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Good basic face wash for combination skin</li>
            <li> Overall, good value for the price.    </li>
            <li> The pump is a great addition considering the wash is very liquidy which surprised me at first</li>
            <li> Since my preteen years I&#x27;ve sufferered with mild acne on my lower face.</li>
            <li> When I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> Simply the best face wash I have ever tried and will keep it as my daily wash from now on.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne caused by stress</li>
            <li> This has helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> Skin feels really squeaky clean afterwards!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never minded medicinal smelling things, as long as it was good for me, like this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a long time, and I loved it, I decided to buy it again, and it clears my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The new pump is much better...</li>
            <li> It feels clean, it smells clean, lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Pros: favorite cleanser to clean makeup brushes or makeup in general.</li>
            <li> This face wash has done amazing things for my acne and overall complexion without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad they fixed it.  </li>
            <li> As an individual with combination/oily skin, I had doubts whether this cleanser would be effective.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep skin clear and is healthy for you.</li>
            <li> Its worth trying</li>
            <li> Totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li> , You only need a tiny bit to wash your face and it works incredible well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used love the natural ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> like it, but it is very watery and does kind of dry my face, but after putting on oil, its fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am super satisfied with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> A great face wash, very harsh if (when) you get it in your eyes, but you&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if it just has that strong of an odor.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and reacts strongly to products I use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the clean feeling but definitely need to use moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> I use this product daily sometimes twice as recommended and it keeps my face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> All natural, and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a month and must say it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I love this facial soap.</li>
            <li> It was a bit overpowering at first use</li>
            <li> I know all products don&#x27;t respond the same for everyone, but for me I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell(very Earthy-like dirt or Sandalwood), but it&#x27;s tolerable and very much worth it for the wonders it&#x27;s worked for my skin.</li>
            <li> It will help so much!</li>
            <li> The product has a rather nice smell to it, which I was not expecting considering what other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Remember to air dry or lightly pat your face with a clean towell.  </li>
            <li> and then I use the desert essence blemish touch stick for any little breakouts, and now I have clean and clear skin :) !</li>
            <li> I love this face wash and have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the wash I followed the directions and gently soaped my face for a minute.  </li>
            <li> I was mislead with this facial wash, I got it because it didn&#x27;t have any strong chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has an incredibly strong smell) as well as the moisturizer (definitely get this if you get the cleansing pads, as the pads take a bit of getting used to, the moisturizer helps).</li>
            <li> My only advice is that I would recommend investing in a good moisturizer because it does tend to dry your face out.</li>
            <li> The product did not burn my eyes or skin and it rinsed perfectly fine and left my skin feeling the absolute cleanest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I use it just because it really cleans my face</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Priced reasonable for the amount of face wash</li>
            <li> I really like the way it cleans and leaves my skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is very tea tree smelling which I like</li>
            <li> My teanage son uses this nightly and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Relatively gentle, could be drying.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and ingredients in this face wash.  </li>
            <li> and I do really</li>
            <li> I really like the product with the exception of the texture -- or lack thereof.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it as much as I like</li>
            <li> but I really like the product</li>
            <li> and nothing seemed to really work.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast and even wrapped the item on case it leaked.</li>
            <li> (Some say it is very watery, which it is</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t matter)</li>
            <li> Really dries out your skin</li>
            <li> I liked this brand enough that I started using it&#x27;s facial cleansing pads (4 stars.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and clean without drying me out or making me oily, better than more expensive &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly going to super shrink your pores, but I think it has improved my complexion and leaves my skin feeling clean but without over drying.  </li>
            <li> Also other products perform better for the price.</li>
            <li> Recently, I discovered I have a severe glycerin allergy, and I was excited to try desert essence castile soap, because I had heard it did not have any glycerin in it, and also did not have hemp like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap.</li>
            <li> After using this and the thoroughly clean facial lotion I don&#x27;t even feel a need to put on foundation, primer, mineral veil or anything.</li>
            <li> I love the limited list of ingredients and the fact that I can identify each (natural) one.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> I love that this wash avoids needless chemicals and does a better job than national brands with millions in marketing to convince consumers to buy.</li>
            <li> My older kids don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS SO BITTER AND STRONG AND LASTED HOURS.</li>
            <li> The high content of tea tree oil seems to be soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> I would like something a little more substantial so that it doesn&#x27;t run out of my hand when I use the pump on the bottle</li>
            <li> It not only cleans my skin but leaves it feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> Tea trea is a natural cleaner and really helps normalize oily skin.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all of the redness, I have noticed a considerable reduction in redness and my skin is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is all natural; there are virtually no toxic chemicals, only essential oils and soap.  </li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk to normal size.....</li>
            <li> feel normal and no longer ashamed to be in public!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I am hoping desert essence plain castile soap will be better.</li>
            <li> Last night I used this face wash for the first time (after dumping another face wash of another brand - that did nothing really for me - down the sink) and I could feel it working right away!</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have been fighting breakouts since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, the slightest thing can set it off, but I have no issues</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong &amp; masquline but doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that the solution is very runny so it squirts out of the pump and generally gets all over the place except my hands.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin, this can dry you out more.  </li>
            <li> Once I learned to clean around the eye (and you seriously have to be careful here, don&#x27;t just throw water willy nilly onto your face, better yet use a washcloth)</li>
            <li> Past products I used never quite got that clean feeling and caused too much dryness.</li>
            <li> It always seems to clear my face from acne.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear and cleanses of oils.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural face wash that was gentle enough to use year-round.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is the example of sensitivity, even dermatologists have struggled to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m 52) and this has stopped it completely.  </li>
            <li> This works well to leave my skin soft and not greasy or pealing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a cleanser that was all natural.</li>
            <li> The face wash feels natural on my skin and clears away all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Buy at natural grocers if you have one, it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product on a wimp because I was searching for a natural face wash.</li>
            <li> and i do have quite sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t break me out even with the highly sensitive skin that I am so blessed to have.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> This might be all natural and Castile soap, but does it have to smell like desert dust?  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, I would recommend using this once a day</li>
            <li> This is a young man who has taken care of chickens and the smell did not bother him.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong, but just be sure to get the right type.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without any stinging or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but it makes my skin feel soft!!</li>
            <li> My skin went from being covered with pimples, especially my chin area, but now I&#x27;m completely pimple free with only the occasional minor flareup which goes away in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have stopped buying the over marketed national brands that change their formula quarterly in order to campaign a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula which is actually just a mix of new chemicals.</li>
            <li> Plus, the actual soap is very drying, leaving my mixed skin chapped.</li>
            <li> I know its going to take time for me to see some major changes in my face, but I like the way it makes my face feel after I wash</li>
            <li> I use organic coconut oil as a makeup remover/moisturizer and the desert essence face wash every other day, it really cleans my skin without stripping it!</li>
            <li> Cleans like no other.  </li>
            <li> Definitely reccomend it to people dealing with acne or frequent breakouts!</li>
            <li> It has not caused me to break-out, but it also has not helped clear up my teenage daughters face.  </li>
            <li> My skin goes in cycles and apparently I will continue to have break outs well into my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> All I noticed was that my face wasn&#x27;t red or getting red, my skin felt soft, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> you definitely don&#x27;t want to get the pads if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of natural facial products!)</li>
            <li> I never thought I would get rid of it, and especially not from exclusively using natural products.</li>
            <li> but now I barely notice.</li>
            <li> Because the product is rather thin, it dumps out way more than I need.</li>
            <li> I think this cleanse was primarily for those who wear heavy make up, I DON&#x27;T WEAR MAKE UP AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> If you have normal or dry skin, this is not for you, unless you are going to follow up with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would recommend, especially if you have slightly oily skin as it leaves you squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money all all different cleansers&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t read carefully, I ordered the one for oily to normal and should have ordered dry to normal.  </li>
            <li> I spent months trying to find something that worked to get me normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a new empty bottle at a store just to transfer this product to.</li>
            <li> Although I decided to try it after years of attempts with drug store facial cleansers that have done nothing for my skin and I am beyond pleased to say the very least!</li>
            <li> Its not harsh like other face washes....</li>
            <li> The main ingredient in this wash is castile soap which is quite harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for a very long time, cystic acne mixed with regular pimples....</li>
            <li> Now I mix it with my other cream-based face wash, and it doesnt seem to dry out my skin nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not working so far after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t make me red or dry!!</li>
            <li> I started using this on my face along with coconut oil right after my shower and after only a few weeks my psoriasis has probably cleared up at least 75% and to me</li>
            <li> Do not wipe your face to dry if you have acne.</li>
            <li> My face was either too dry and started to peel or too oily and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> but nothing some water and a dry towel can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin dry as the desert (maybe thats the reason for the name?)</li>
            <li> I have oily, and yet inexplicably sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t caused dryness or little bumps on me like other cleansers have, even though I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It does not leave my face very dry either</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth and the smell is not that bad</li>
            <li> It cleanses deeply and works very well for clearing up troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the label for the product is made of paper and just dissolves when you touch it with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on products that never work...</li>
            <li> The soap is watery thin, but it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Upon some further research and clarification I discovered the plain desert essence castile soap has fewer ingredients and does not contain glycerin, so I am going to give that a try.</li>
            <li> do not let the liquid thing fool you because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Product itself is sorta liquidy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I also use it on other parts of my body before I apply a peel to eliminate any germs.</li>
            <li> my face out like the other products that I have used.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face timidly and was very careful with my eyes</li>
            <li> Hey, ITS NATURAL , and natural stuff do not always smell as &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; as the artificial stuff that puts the chemical that causes cancer etc on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for two or three weeks in the hopes that it was clearing me out, but it only got worse, like several cystic pimples at one time.</li>
            <li> Although tea tree oil can be drying, my husband has very sensitive skin and has never experienced an issue.</li>
            <li> My husband had the same complaint.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the price paid.  </li>
            <li> previous bottle would leak from the pump stem and drove me nuts.</li>
            <li> I still experience breakouts, but noticeably less.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin MUCH less oily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakouts and this does a decent job at keeping them at bay, though it is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Also for some reason the bottle lable printing started flaking off and made a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> As past reviews say, be careful around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> They have even tried me on systemic treatments that have failed completely for my extremely resistant case.</li>
            <li> That said, I do use it to wash eye makeup off and just keep my eyes tightly shut</li>
            <li> I recommend this face wash but the one thing I don&#x27;t like is how it makes my face feel tight after using.</li>
            <li> Wasted a lot of product through the pump stem previously</li>
            <li> go away not even a little.</li>
            <li> but I worry that it&#x27;s a little drying.  </li>
            <li> So as I get the product out it leaves little pieces of paper on my palms.</li>
            <li> and now I have the glow after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> harsh chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was scared to use it because I had read reviews saying it was too harsh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: It ended up being too harsh.</li>
            <li> for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> I continue to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I will review the plain castile soap when it arrives.</li>
            <li> This face wash is a way watery and a little hard to use</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not. : (</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too lazy to buy eye makeup remover).</li>
            <li> If you get them, i recommend rubbing a small spot of acne, then rinsing it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been prone to acne outbreaks for the past 35 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser in the past, but then decided to change my regime.</li>
            <li> (btw, it does sting if it gets in there), kept rubbing and rubbing and by the time I was done washing my face, I didn&#x27;t feel any sting, any discomfort or nothing negative.</li>
            <li> It says use twice daily, it dried my skin out really bad that i had to use neosporin to heal my face from the peeling.</li>
            <li> This is one of the least harmful face washing products to use.  </li>
            <li> However, even after the first day of use, it dried my skin out horribly, and I broke out in acne.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I hated it!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that you have to be very careful about your eyes - it is brutal if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are worse.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for oily skin and my skin is worse than before.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little medicinal, so those who purchase skincare products based on smells, or who cannot tolerate unpleasant scents, may not want this.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product or any product that contained oils for that matter because of how oily my skin is.</li>
            <li> However, I seem to get the random break out no matter what I use.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it sometimes when my face is crazy oily and/or horribly broken out</li>
            <li> Hate to leave a harsh review</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product dried my skin out so bad after one use!</li>
            <li> I have had terrible psoriasis for years and am allergic to all of the creams and ointments I have previously tried OTC and from my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt so bad-</li>
            <li> but it ended up drying my skin out so bad!</li>
            <li> then it was terrible and stuck for (what i thought was forever)</li>
            <li> So it has a terrible smell, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> My face broke out horribly.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and irritates face.</li>
            <li> The customer service of this company is also terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this facial soap. It always seems to clear my face from acne. My brother who has severe acne and has gone to a dermatologist uses this soap too. It seems to soothe his face and remove the redness of the acne. He has not yet tried obagi which is always recommended by the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This face wash is a way watery and a little hard to use but my face did clear up nicely after I started using it, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because of all the good reviews. I have been using it twice a day every day for weeks and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me. I had a baby 10 months ago and haven&#x27;t been able to be on birth control to control my hormones and acne. So I hoped this would be a good solution. Unfortunately not. : (</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product or any product that contained oils for that matter because of how oily my skin is. Although I decided to try it after years of attempts with drug store facial cleansers that have done nothing for my skin and I am beyond pleased to say the very least! The product did not burn my eyes or skin and it rinsed perfectly fine and left my skin feeling the absolute cleanest it&#x27;s ever been. After using this and the thoroughly clean facial lotion I don&#x27;t even feel a need to put on foundation, primer, mineral veil or anything. My skin looks as if I already have it on! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Wish I would have tried it years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already repurchased this product. My face never felt soooo clean. This is great for anyone. I use it just because it really cleans my face and I also use it on other parts of my body before I apply a peel to eliminate any germs. My daughter uses it also for acne and before a peel is applied.</li>
            <li> This face wash has done amazing things for my acne and overall complexion without drying my face out. That is all I could ever ask for in a face wash! The pump is a great addition considering the wash is very liquidy which surprised me at first but I grew to love as it lathers up easily. I use this daily in the shower and supplement with the face wipes. I have stopped buying the over marketed national brands that change their formula quarterly in order to campaign a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula which is actually just a mix of new chemicals. I love that this wash avoids needless chemicals and does a better job than national brands with millions in marketing to convince consumers to buy.</li>
            <li> I was mislead with this facial wash, I got it because it didn&#x27;t have any strong chemicals. I have sensitive skin and I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too strong and this seemed it but it smells very strong like it will get the job done but I have been using it for a month and I have yet to see any progress or results. It may just be my skin. It will work for someone with oily skin or combination.</li>
            <li> I had an airbnb guest over and asked how he got the most beautiful skin, he wrote down this bottle and now I have the glow after a few weeks.  AND... it smells great.</li>
            <li> this thing works! it feels AMAZING when i put it on after a shower!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is all natural; there are virtually no toxic chemicals, only essential oils and soap.  The scent is a little medicinal, so those who purchase skincare products based on smells, or who cannot tolerate unpleasant scents, may not want this.  I&#x27;ve never minded medicinal smelling things, as long as it was good for me, like this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -no harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- tons of essential oils&lt;br /&gt;- Priced reasonable for the amount of face wash&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -smells medicinal</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been sharing  this facial cleanser for a couple of years. He started using it in college and then got me hooked after I had to borrow it one weekend. I have used dozens of cleansers, from dermatologist recommended grocery store brands to top dollar spa lines to all the raging all-natural and organic companies. This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. It cleanses deeply and works very well for clearing up troubled skin. Although tea tree oil can be drying, my husband has very sensitive skin and has never experienced an issue. This product has my full support.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have been fighting breakouts since I was in high school.  I&#x27;ve been using for 1 week and my skin has cleared up drastically.  It is watery, but foams well.  It has a scent that reminds me of the T-Gel shampoo that isn&#x27;t the greatest, but as soon as I rinse it&#x27;s gone--the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  I have always used moisturizer and have to after using this product as well.</li>
            <li> i love it my gf recommended me this and I love it and I am a guy</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash. Was a great price and fast delivery. Will definitely continue to use this product and others within this brand.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash. I have been using in for 3 years now, I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your skin clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t like the scent, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money all all different cleansers&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this one after reading about it from a review from someone with shiny oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O M G......LOVE.  I will have this on stock in my house forever.&lt;br /&gt;never stop making&lt;br /&gt;gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin,  perfect.</li>
            <li> My daughter seems pleased.</li>
            <li> Last night I used this face wash for the first time (after dumping another face wash of another brand - that did nothing really for me - down the sink) and I could feel it working right away! I loved the CLEAN feel I had when I washed it off. Will keep using it and I probably will update this review in a couple weeks to give a more thorough review.</li>
            <li> Lovely, clean feel and fragrance</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a long time, and I loved it, I decided to buy it again, and it clears my skin almost immediately. Love love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a 1.5 years now. I really like the way it cleans and leaves my skin feeling.  My skin goes in cycles and apparently I will continue to have break outs well into my 30&#x27;s. This does help but I do still get break outs.  However, I seem to get the random break out no matter what I use.  I agree with other reviews that you have to be very careful about your eyes - it is brutal if you get it in your eyes. That said, I do use it to wash eye makeup off and just keep my eyes tightly shut (I&#x27;m too lazy to buy eye makeup remover). It is very tea tree smelling which I like but others might find over powering.  They recently redid their bottles from a regular pump to a pump with a sort of sleeve.  The new pump is much better... previous bottle would leak from the pump stem and drove me nuts. Wasted a lot of product through the pump stem previously so I&#x27;m glad they fixed it.  All in all I would recommend, especially if you have slightly oily skin as it leaves you squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t over dry.  I like the fairly simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent face wash for teens, or anyone with oily skin or acne.  Tea trea is a natural cleaner and really helps normalize oily skin.  This face wash is the purest and most effective wash I&#x27;ve found.  My teanage son uses this nightly and it has really made a difference.  If you have normal or dry skin, this is not for you, unless you are going to follow up with a moisturizer.  It is an excellent cleaner.  Remember to air dry or lightly pat your face with a clean towell.  Do not wipe your face to dry if you have acne.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was scared to use it because I had read reviews saying it was too harsh. My skin is the example of sensitivity, even dermatologists have struggled to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin sensitive. That being said, I took my risk with this product and bought it....boy, was I pleased! I put it on my face timidly and was very careful with my eyes (btw, it does sting if it gets in there), kept rubbing and rubbing and by the time I was done washing my face, I didn&#x27;t feel any sting, any discomfort or nothing negative. All I noticed was that my face wasn&#x27;t red or getting red, my skin felt soft, I was pleasantly surprised. I started using it every day and no sensitivities, my face has cleared out and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy! The smell is kind of earthy but not something you can&#x27;t get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It ended up being too harsh. Couldn&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it has cleared by face up drastically.</li>
            <li> Not working so far after a few weeks.  My breakouts are worse.  I bought this for oily skin and my skin is worse than before.  Have to try something else. Sadly, this didn&#x27;t work for me.  It kind of stinks too...something I would gladly put up with if it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Very good! I like it. It makes my face feel so nice and refreshed. Friend recommended it for acne. It helps.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face wash. It not only cleans my skin but leaves it feeling super soft! The smell is a bit strong, but it wasn&#x27;t intolerable, nor did it hurt my eyes. I liked this brand enough that I started using it&#x27;s facial cleansing pads (4 stars. you definitely don&#x27;t want to get the pads if you have sensitive skin. If you get them, i recommend rubbing a small spot of acne, then rinsing it off with a washcloth. It has an incredibly strong smell) as well as the moisturizer (definitely get this if you get the cleansing pads, as the pads take a bit of getting used to, the moisturizer helps). Over all, i love this product and brand and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love Desert Essence tea tree oil, so I thought I&#x27;d love this too. It made my face feel really clean but it ended up drying my skin out so bad! My husband had the same complaint. It has a great scent, but I didn&#x27;t like that it was almost the same consistency as water.</li>
            <li> Love this product. We&#x27;ve been using it for years. Keeps skin clear and cleanses of oils. Good for all skin types</li>
            <li> Used this for 2 months. My oily acne prone skin did not like it and it broke me out.</li>
            <li> This soap does get my face very clean and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell.  It has not caused me to break-out, but it also has not helped clear up my teenage daughters face.  I will continue to use it, but we&#x27;re moving her on to something else.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash and have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 6 months ago.  absolutely love it, and i&#x27;ll never use anything else! I&#x27;d been prone to acne outbreaks for the past 35 years (i&#x27;m 52) and this has stopped it completely.  I use this every AM &amp; PM, along with Jojoba Oil and or coconut oil to moisturize.</li>
            <li> This works well to leave my skin soft and not greasy or pealing. with that being said it gets the 2 stars because of the smell I cringe everytime i use it because its odor is soo strong and offensive to my nostrils. the best way i can describe the smell is something like a mix of Sandlewood,Musk and Cat pee.</li>
            <li> As an individual with combination/oily skin, I had doubts whether this cleanser would be effective.  Past products I used never quite got that clean feeling and caused too much dryness. After hearing about the wonders of tea tree oil, I decided to give this product a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a month and must say it&#x27;s pretty good.  It&#x27;s not exactly going to super shrink your pores, but I think it has improved my complexion and leaves my skin feeling clean but without over drying.  Traits, important to deal with oily skin.  The only knock on the product is the scent.  It was a bit overpowering at first use (i guess that&#x27;s the tea tree stuff) but you get used to it (or over it).  I know all products don&#x27;t respond the same for everyone, but for me I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it. It keeps my skin pretty clear.  I have very sensitive skin, the slightest thing can set it off, but I have no issues</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and reacts strongly to products I use. My face was either too dry and started to peel or too oily and shiny all day. I spent months trying to find something that worked to get me normal. Finding this was like a miracle. It leaves my skin soft and clean without drying me out or making me oily, better than more expensive &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products. I won&#x27;t use anything else for my skin now and I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with it. The smell is also nice.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this. It helps keep skin clear and is healthy for you.</li>
            <li> Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  Will not use anything else on my face.  Helps with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Tried this after reading some of the reviews but I didn&#x27;t get noticable results.  Certainly not worth the price paid.  Also for some reason the bottle lable printing started flaking off and made a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> It says use twice daily, it dried my skin out really bad that i had to use neosporin to heal my face from the peeling. Maybe I just have sensitive skin. Maybe don&#x27;t use it twice a day. I haven&#x27;t been seeing any skin-toning effects from this. Now I mix it with my other cream-based face wash, and it doesnt seem to dry out my skin nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviews comment about the smell of this product. I LOVE the smell, because it smells a lot like tea tree oil. The smell of tea tree oil, for those who aren&#x27;t familiar, can probably be compared to how a nail shop has that strong nail polish or acrylic smell that just lingers? Its very strong and permeating like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I accidentally got this stuff in my mouth (??? somehow in the rinsing-it-off process, i dont know!!) and it wasnt so bad- for a few seconds. then it was terrible and stuck for (what i thought was forever) hours, in the back of my throat. IT WAS SO BITTER AND STRONG AND LASTED HOURS. DO NOT EAT THIS PRODUCT. please!</li>
            <li> Quite nice, makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. Relatively gentle, could be drying. I enjoy it much more than Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree cleanser</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and ingredients in this face wash.  Because I didn&#x27;t read carefully, I ordered the one for oily to normal and should have ordered dry to normal.  Desert Essence is a wonderful, natural brand.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, but just be sure to get the right type.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for the last 3 days and I do really like it I know its going to take time for me to see some major changes in my face, but I like the way it makes my face feel after I wash and I definitely see a shine to it now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works great and makes your skin smooth as a babies ass.</li>
            <li> I really like the product with the exception of the texture -- or lack thereof.  It&#x27;s the consistency of water.  I would like something a little more substantial so that it doesn&#x27;t run out of my hand when I use the pump on the bottle</li>
            <li> Great Amazon Seller. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best facial cleaner I have ever found! I ordered the refill along with this application bottle and am very glad I did. One squirt cleans your entire face and get ALL makeup off! Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product dried my skin out so bad after one use! I think this cleanse was primarily for those who wear heavy make up, I DON&#x27;T WEAR MAKE UP AT ALL!! THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR ME</li>
            <li> ***Updated product Review**** I have been using this product for a few months now and I still absolutely love it! My skin went from being covered with pimples, especially my chin area, but now I&#x27;m completely pimple free with only the occasional minor flareup which goes away in just a couple of days. I still use it once a day and moisturize afterwards. I cant recommend this product enough!!! Its worth trying</li>
            <li> Since my preteen years I&#x27;ve sufferered with mild acne on my lower face. Therefore, I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of facial cleansers. When I found out I was pregnant I wanted to find a cleanser that was all natural. Since using this product, my face has cleared up remarkably. My only advice is that I would recommend investing in a good moisturizer because it does tend to dry your face out.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin, and I have noticed an improvement since using this product (about 6 months ago). I still experience breakouts, but noticeably less. The face wash feels natural on my skin and clears away all of my makeup. This product makes my skin MUCH less oily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my face. It can be a bit drying, but I use Tate&#x27;s Miracle Conditioner as a moisturizer and that has also improved my skin. I would definitely recommend this product--especially since it is all-natural and vegan!</li>
            <li> I really like it but it never helped me with my acne go away not even a little. not for my skin I guess.</li>
            <li> So it has a terrible smell, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. The soap is wonderful for my oily skin. I love the limited list of ingredients and the fact that I can identify each (natural) one. Totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin, this can dry you out more.  It does seem to help with my acne prone skin though...</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great product  works so well it dries my skin but I counter that with face moisturizer</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! It works great and really clears skin up. My only issue was personal and the fact I couldn&#x27;t use it twice a day like the label had said. It made my face red so I can&#x27;t use it as much as I like but I really like the product and it works well for as often as I use it!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I hated it! It singed my eyes and turned them red. However, I was staying at a friend&#x27;s house and it was all I had to use. Once I learned to clean around the eye (and you seriously have to be careful here, don&#x27;t just throw water willy nilly onto your face, better yet use a washcloth), I realized that this stuff leaves my face *squeaky* clean, literally! It has all these hippy ingredients like tea tree oil, ginger, awapuhi and chamomile that magically scrape the gunk right off your face. By the end of the week I noticed a difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call this cleanser &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;, but its definitely not overpowering. I have oily, and yet inexplicably sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t caused dryness or little bumps on me like other cleansers have, even though I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks. I went ahead and bought one for myself. NOTE: I only use a bit at a time, and I have been putting it in a liquid-to-foam bottle, which may help with its effectiveness. I found the bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean well. The tea tree smell is not my favorite but I knew that before I bought it. What I don&#x27;t like is that the solution is very runny so it squirts out of the pump and generally gets all over the place except my hands.</li>
            <li> My sister was using this to help get rid of acne scars, and I decided to give it a try because I have acne scars as well, and I started using it twice a day and a lot of my acne scars have gone away! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks!</li>
            <li> like it, but it is very watery and does kind of dry my face, but after putting on oil, its fine. My skin seems to accept it and that is what matters. Don&#x27;t mind the smell. lasts forever. Buy at natural grocers if you have one, it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product on a wimp because I was searching for a natural face wash. After receiving it and using this face wash ........OH MY GOODNESS I just LOVE how this face wash cleans and make my face feel. It also removed my makeup which was a plus for me. I have very dry skin but this face wash didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;dry my face out like the other products that I have used. The smell does not bother me at all in fact I kindly like the smell. Hey, ITS NATURAL , and natural stuff do not always smell as &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; as the artificial stuff that puts the chemical that causes cancer etc on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now do not let the liquid thing fool you because a little goes a long way, You only need a tiny bit to wash your face and it works incredible well. Simply the best face wash I have ever tried and will keep it as my daily wash from now on.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural face wash that was gentle enough to use year-round.  The main ingredient in this wash is castile soap which is quite harsh.  The first time I used the wash I followed the directions and gently soaped my face for a minute.  Two days later my face started cracking and flaking off.  Now I just use one squirt in my body wash to give it that nice, clean scent.  It also makes it rinse easier.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells like Tea Tree Oil, but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good face wash, I&#x27;ve tried everything, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc. and nothing seemed to really work.  I tried this and I feel my acne has gotten better!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. That is all. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great smells great and does not upset my skin and i do have quite sensitive skin. Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> This wash smells SO GOOD!!! I love it! And my skin feels very clean after.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin squeeky clean and smells great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! makes my face feel so clean and smooth. And doesn&#x27;t break me out even with the highly sensitive skin that I am so blessed to have. I highly recommend this product! Don&#x27;t get in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Smells kind of sagey, works well with My skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and I can already see the results. I have mild acne caused by stress (im a college student) and My skin feels Extremely clean after using this to wash my face. It does not leave my face very dry either but I do like to to moisturize after. The tea tree oil in the wash is helping to fade some of the pesky acne scars I have and has improved the overall feel and tone of my skin. Very happy. Definitely would recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> Ver strong astringent smell.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without any stinging or harsh chemicals. I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This organic face cleanser is one of my favorites. The smell is wonderful and leaves your face feeling very fresh and clean. It also foams a lot which is great for cleansing after you have removed your makeup. It&#x27;s not the best for removing makeup, but I don&#x27;t blame them because it is a face cleanser, not makeup remover. This product is excellent and I would recommend it to everyone! I also have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It foams up so quickly and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean!  As past reviews say, be careful around the eyes.  It does burn a bit if you get it in but nothing some water and a dry towel can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Great face wash! All natural, and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. Great price for an all natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> Found my cleanser for life. This has helped my acne tremendously. I&#x27;ve used this cleanser in the past, but then decided to change my regime. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. My face broke out horribly. Soon as I returned to this cleanser my face began to heal. I will always keep this cleanser as part of my routine.</li>
            <li> This smell takes some getting used to, but it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> The desert essence skin care line is the BEST I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had problem skin for a very long time, cystic acne mixed with regular pimples....dry/oily skin at the same time...irritation....everything. BUT that changed when I added the desert essence skin care products to my regimen! I use organic coconut oil as a makeup remover/moisturizer and the desert essence face wash every other day, it really cleans my skin without stripping it! Its not harsh like other face washes....and then I use the desert essence blemish touch stick for any little breakouts, and now I have clean and clear skin :) ! Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this wash.  I ordered the face pads for my grandson to help with his occasional acne.</li>
            <li> Feels very clean, good price, bought a refill. Also, the Tea Tree Oil ointment by Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> This is what I use nightly.  I like it, but I worry that it&#x27;s a little drying.  But, most face washes are-- especially natural ones!  I use their night cream moisturizer after this and my skin looks great the next day.  I think the tea tree oil is really effective in helping to prevent break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had oily skin when I was younger and I think this product would be great for that.  Now that I&#x27;m 50, my skin still has some oily areas although my cheeks are drier.  This is working for me.  (I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of natural facial products!)</li>
            <li> Cleans like no other.  So squeaky, smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this face wash. It cleans my face well and is great for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, which I can get over as it&#x27;s only on my face for a minute. The part that I dislike is the packaging. The pump broke after a week so I have to unscrew the top to get the product out. Because the product is rather thin, it dumps out way more than I need. Also, the label for the product is made of paper and just dissolves when you touch it with wet hands. So as I get the product out it leaves little pieces of paper on my palms. I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a new empty bottle at a store just to transfer this product to. With the price of this product, I was hoping for a better bottle design. Because of the inconvenience of the packaging I will likely not buy this product again but will find something similar.</li>
            <li> Pros: favorite cleanser to clean makeup brushes or makeup in general. This stuff strips. I use it sometimes when my face is crazy oily and/or horribly broken out and it does help. I would never use this twice a day, I would never use this in the winter. But it&#x27;s definitely become a staple in my bathroom. It does not break me out but it probably would if I overused it and didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast and even wrapped the item on case it leaked. Product itself is sorta liquidy, a little goes a long way. It works great, I can definitely feel it cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> A great face wash, very harsh if (when) you get it in your eyes, but you&#x27;ll get over it. It leaves skin dry as the desert (maybe thats the reason for the name?) so make sure you&#x27;ve got a good moisturizer on hand. Definitely reccomend it to people dealing with acne or frequent breakouts!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it also on my bald head after shaving. The high content of tea tree oil seems to be soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth and the smell is not that bad</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and irritates face. Also other products perform better for the price. The customer service of this company is also terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible don&#x27;t buy! Save ur money</li>
            <li> This is one of the least harmful face washing products to use.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> Okay.  This might be all natural and Castile soap, but does it have to smell like desert dust?  This is definitely the essence of the desert.  If a good shower to you sounds like rolling around in the dirt in Phoenix, then this soap is for you!  I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  Plus, the actual soap is very drying, leaving my mixed skin chapped.</li>
            <li> Peculiar cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on the skin,  savage on the eyes- keep those shut!  Skin feels really squeaky clean afterwards!  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better skin ever than before from using this face wash. If you have sensitive skin like me, I would recommend using this once a day or you might have some dryness and redness... Other than that I am super satisfied with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> Recently, I discovered I have a severe glycerin allergy, and I was excited to try desert essence castile soap, because I had heard it did not have any glycerin in it, and also did not have hemp like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap. Upon receiving the face wash I discovered that it does, in fact, have glycerin. Upon some further research and clarification I discovered the plain desert essence castile soap has fewer ingredients and does not contain glycerin, so I am going to give that a try. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE A GLYCERIN ALLERGY. I will review the plain castile soap when it arrives. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is too greasy for the face so I am hoping desert essence plain castile soap will be better. Hate to leave a harsh review but I wanted to make sure anyone with an allergy as severe as mine was aware of the glycerin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have had terrible psoriasis for years and am allergic to all of the creams and ointments I have previously tried OTC and from my Dermatologist. They have even tried me on systemic treatments that have failed completely for my extremely resistant case. I started using this on my face along with coconut oil right after my shower and after only a few weeks my psoriasis has probably cleared up at least 75% and to me that is a miracle. I never thought I would get rid of it, and especially not from exclusively using natural products. I really dislike the smell(very Earthy-like dirt or Sandalwood), but it&#x27;s tolerable and very much worth it for the wonders it&#x27;s worked for my skin.</li>
            <li> Favorite face wash I&#x27;ve ever used love the natural ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly, smelled fairly nice (as nice as tea tree oil can smell), and lathered surprisingly well. However, even after the first day of use, it dried my skin out horribly, and I broke out in acne. I continued to use it for two or three weeks in the hopes that it was clearing me out, but it only got worse, like several cystic pimples at one time. I really wanted this to work because I had heard good things about this cleanser, but it just wasn&#x27;t good for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne...I have spent hundreds of dollars on products that never work...This product actually gets rid of my blemishes! Not only does it work, but it makes my skin feel soft!! And it doesn&#x27;t make me red or dry!! I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The product does have a strong smell (a bit like pine sol), but my skin feel very clean and silky smooth when I wash with it.  I am prone to breakouts and this does a decent job at keeping them at bay, though it is not perfect.  I does a very good job of removing makeup, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry at all.</li>
            <li> Good basic face wash for combination skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, including the SMELL, which I&#x27;ve read is not pleasing to some. It feels clean, it smells clean, lathers really well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. (Some say it is very watery, which it is but it really doesn&#x27;t matter) Makes my incredibly oily skin squeaky clean. The smell is something you have to get used to, it is STRONG like punch you in the face strong those first couple times but now I barely notice. It was a bit spilled in shipping but you get a lot for your money so good to go.</li>
            <li> I recommend this face wash but the one thing I don&#x27;t like is how it makes my face feel tight after using. I enjoy the clean feeling but definitely need to use moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He told me the smell was so foul, that he could not use it. This is a young man who has taken care of chickens and the smell did not bother him. He threw it in the trash because he said he could not put it on his face again. I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if it just has that strong of an odor.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily sometimes twice as recommended and it keeps my face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice Easy&lt;br /&gt;Transaction ! No Problems!</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin within a week. My pores have shrunk to normal size.....&lt;br /&gt;I feel normal and no longer ashamed to be in public!&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest using the blemish roll on stuff. Within two days it cleared up really big blemishes that I had.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been battling blemishes for decades, and this is the only thing that has worked.</li>
            <li> Well i ordered this because I had been using bar soap and figured a liquid castile soap might be better and cleaner to use. This one DOES THOROUGHLY CLEAN. It shoots out like liquid because that&#x27;s what it is! I had no issues with the pump. Just have your hand up to catch it and rub in between palms b4 applying to face. I like it! The smell is too strong &amp; masquline but doesnt last too long. Cleans and improves the look and feel of my skin, but it does burn it a bit so I may not purchase again. If you have oily/acne skin: use liquid castile soap! It will help so much!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I continue to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and this face wash is just fantastic.  While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all of the redness, I have noticed a considerable reduction in redness and my skin is much smoother.  I would recommend this for anyone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, good value for the price.    Pros:     * The product has a rather nice smell to it, which I was not expecting considering what other reviewers have said. Obviously smell is a matter of preference, but I like it!    * The soap is watery thin, but it lathers very well. If the thinness of the soap is bothersome, I would suggest investing in a liquid to foam pump.    * It left my face feeling squeaky clean, which impressed me!      Con:     * The item arrived partially open and some of the contents had spilled out.</li>
            <li> My older kids don&#x27;t like the smell.  It works, though!  My husband and I have used this for over a year.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Really dries out your skin</li>
            <li> It stings and I don&#x27;t know if I was allergic to something in it, but after that three month trial I&#x27;m not using it again.</li>
