            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon as the stores quit carrying it</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I hope I will always be able to find this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything close to it anywhere in the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products</li>
            <li>I love this product, and nothing else works like this does on my hair.</li>
            <li>the Original VersaStyler, which is what I was sure is what I&#x27;d ordered.  </li>
            <li>Great product that I have come back to after many years.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and the hold lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has ever come close to doing what Versastyler does for my hair, which is fine and flyaway.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased the VersaStyler Designing Lotion for my mom in Oct. 2010 when she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere any more.  </li>
            <li>Even the original bottle is pictured.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s both our fault for not noticing the \\&quot;Touchable Hold\\&quot; phrase on the bottle, but I&#x27;m just saying you probably won&#x27;t be getting what you&#x27;re expecting, which is the Original VersaStyler you&#x27;re used to using.  </li>
            <li>Notice the original bottle is still pictured.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to get this product through Amazon anbd now have regular shipments.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I could find it and the price is fair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, bouncy and full of body.</li>
            <li>Its most effective when blown dry</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It is great for very short hair since it&#x27;s not a heavy lotion.</li>
            <li>Without this product my hair is fine and fly away -- often irritating me by the end of each day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am glad to finally find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I tried this (bought it on accident, grabbed wrong product), and it is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>You really solved a problem for me!  </li>
            <li>This works wonders in my hair by making the perm look fresh each time I shower and dry my hair after applying this over my hair, its better than a gel or a hairspray</li>
            <li>I was ready to cut my hair off as it had become frizzy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like gel and gives my hair a nice firm hold.</li>
            <li>Great product, very little needed so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love it, but sadly I can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years when I was growing up in junior high and high school, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve used this over 10 years when it was only available to beauticians at the time.</li>
            <li>I can now go two days without shampooing my hair and it looks clean and full for at least 36hrs.</li>
            <li>I have VERY CURLEY hair and this is the only product that I have been able to use that defines the curl and keeps the friz down.</li>
            <li>This product enables me, a person w/ short very  straight hair to put curl in it and hold.</li>
            <li>I used this product several years ago and thought I should try other products just to see if there was a better product.  </li>
            <li>Since there hadn&#x27;t been a problem with her first order, she only opened the box &amp; saw \\&quot;Nexxus Versastyler\\</li>
            <li>No stiff like hairspray at all.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t stiff, but it is a little less soft the first day, but looks great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for my hair, not too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>Even after sleeping on it, it looks better than is did a few hours after styling in the past.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best styling lotion I have ever used - it makes my hair full and my hair holds curl better since I have been using this - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for years and just loved it. Then for whatever reason it was discontinued in the store(s)....I was heartbroken. This product enables me, a person w/ short very  straight hair to put curl in it and hold. Not sticky, or flaky...combs out nicely and no problems with wash out. I am soooooo glad I was able to order online. Hope to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over fifteen years.  It was always hard to find but now it&#x27;s almost impossible in Canada.  Nothing else has ever come close to doing what Versastyler does for my hair, which is fine and flyaway.  Versastyler provides body and shine without residue and stickiness.  I can&#x27;t believe more salons don&#x27;t carry it because I have found NOTHING to compare with Versastyler. I recently contacted Nexus by email and they informed me it is no longer sold in Canada.  So glad Amazon carries it! I will be ordering through Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute best for curly hair. It isn&#x27;t sticky or drying or crisps your hair... nothing ever will compare to this. I have been using it religiously since 1993.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to find. Love this stuff. I order it online and find deals, which is great.</li>
            <li> Great product, very little needed so lasts a long time. Good for all types of hair and styles. Easy to wash out and maintain your hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I used this product several years ago and thought I should try other products just to see if there was a better product.  I have not found anything I liked as well.  My hair is thick and very long and this product holds my hair without being too heavy and stiff feeling.  Amazon is the only place I could find it and the price is fair.  I receive compliments on my hair quite often...I recommend Nexxus styling products to everyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have come back to after many years.  So glad to find it on Amazon as the stores quit carrying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am glad to finally find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s just right for my hair, not too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product ever in the world.  My hair is color-treated and I am 47-years-old.  I was ready to cut my hair off as it had become frizzy and unmanageable.  I tried this (bought it on accident, grabbed wrong product), and it is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found.  I apply 3 pumps to wet hair, then comb how I want, then let dry naturally.  Then I brush it out and a little hairspray.  No blow drying, no curling, it stays PERFECTLY.  This is the best product ever.</li>

            <li> Without this product my hair is fine and fly away -- often irritating me by the end of each day.  With versastyler in my hair (applied when damp) my hair holds shape without the stiff feeling of hairspray.  Its most effective when blown dry it also adds a shine to my hair that is not normally there. Cannot find this in the stores anymore -- must buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Nexxus Versastyler for years. I was so disappointed when the salons quit selling it and Nexxus quit puting it on the shelves in the stores along with all of their other products. I have VERY CURLEY hair and this is the only product that I have been able to use that defines the curl and keeps the friz down. It makes my hair shiny, bouncy and full of body. I hope I will always be able to find this product. I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything close to it anywhere in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dave&#x27;s wife, we share this account on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried so many products it is ridiculous. I have fine, but plentiful, straight hair that usually looked dirty flat and a little greasy by the afternoon. I can now go two days without shampooing my hair and it looks clean and full for at least 36hrs. Even after sleeping on it, it looks better than is did a few hours after styling in the past.  I use two pumps, then style. My hair isn&#x27;t stiff, but it is a little less soft the first day, but looks great. No stiff like hairspray at all.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product over 5 years after accidentally finding this on a supermarket shelf. I have been hooked ever since. It is better than any gel (too soft or heavy) or spray (too firm and messy) I have ever used. Definitely worth the cost. However, it is getting difficult to find this product at drug stores; glad to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This product is a poor replacement of the original nexus verstyler porduct that I purchased for years.  I now have 3 bottles of the touchable hold desinging lotion and will probably never use any of it.  I am very disappointed in Nexus on replacing the original product.</li>
            <li> I have used the VersaStyler lotion for years.  It is great for very short hair since it&#x27;s not a heavy lotion. Easy to use and the hold lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years when I was growing up in junior high and high school, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve used this over 10 years when it was only available to beauticians at the time. Now thats its in Walmart, I can never find it. I love this product, and nothing else works like this does on my hair. I have natually curly frizzy hair, so I get it permed on a regular basis. This works wonders in my hair by making the perm look fresh each time I shower and dry my hair after applying this over my hair, its better than a gel or a hairspray and it doesnt leave residue buildup in your hair like some gels and sprays do, and it smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Beware.  Product is switched.  Not the same product.  I first purchased the VersaStyler Designing Lotion for my mom in Oct. 2010 when she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere any more.  When she started running out last November, she asked me to place another order for her.  She received it promptly.  Since there hadn&#x27;t been a problem with her first order, she only opened the box &amp; saw \\&quot;Nexxus Versastyler\\&quot; not noticing that now the bottle says \\&quot;Touchable Hold\\&quot; below.  When she started using the product last month, she noticed it&#x27;s different; it doesn&#x27;t have the same hold as before &amp; her hair is poofy after using it.  Well, she doesn&#x27;t like it.  I checked and double-checked my past orders &amp; the product description is for the Original VersaStyler, which is what I was sure is what I&#x27;d ordered.  Even the original bottle is pictured.  When I click to review the product, the \\&quot;VersaStyler Touchable Hold\\&quot; product comes up on both orders.  I know it&#x27;s both our fault for not noticing the \\&quot;Touchable Hold\\&quot; phrase on the bottle, but I&#x27;m just saying you probably won&#x27;t be getting what you&#x27;re expecting, which is the Original VersaStyler you&#x27;re used to using.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with anything I&#x27;ve gotten through Amazon, but now it&#x27;s way, way past the 30 days &amp; it&#x27;s not returnable, which makes me mad because I feel there was a bait &amp; switch here.  Notice the original bottle is still pictured.</li>
            <li> I love it, but sadly I can&#x27;t find it any more.  Nexxus must have stopped making this.  I hate it when I find what works for my hair and then it is taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion! I don&#x27;t like gel and gives my hair a nice firm hold. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
