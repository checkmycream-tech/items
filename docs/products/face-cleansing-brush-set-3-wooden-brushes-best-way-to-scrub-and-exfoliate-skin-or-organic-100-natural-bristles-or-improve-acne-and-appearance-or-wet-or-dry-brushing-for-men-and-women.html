            <li>It&#x27;s nice that they sell these in a lot of three.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative to using an exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful, like the fact that they made of natural bristles.</li>

            <li>Love the brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes ...</li>
            <li>My skin looks better</li>
            <li>so my makeup looks better too.</li>
            <li>Useful size, good quality complexion brushes.</li>
            <li>I feel the wood is better for the environment than plastic.</li>
            <li>We use our brushes every day and have been extremely pleased with them.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d do better with shower brush that you can get from walmart.</li>
            <li>I am using one and love to have two to spare.</li>
            <li>and I use it with my favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles that is ideal for face use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a couple months now and LOVE the effect they&#x27;ve had on my complexion.  </li>
            <li>More appropriate for scrubbing  your feet, or perhaps pots and pans.  </li>
            <li>I was able to share them with my family since the set came with three brushes.</li>
            <li>Still satisfied with my purchase though.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more youthful and feels softer.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush on my face.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a better clean and exfoliation than a washcloth!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product and a good value.</li>
            <li>Feel great and make my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I was using the plastic/acrylic brush set for a while, but agree with another reviewer that I wanted something that would biodegrate or recycle easily.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, and my skin on my face looks more healthy than before.</li>
            <li>I  love the brushes very much I do believe that my product goes on my face better and my face just seems to have a glow to it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference on the texture of my skin, the tone and color of my skin and how easily it absorbs products I use and how well moisturized it is.  </li>
            <li>Will enjoy trying them out</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable in your hand</li>
            <li>The wooden handles are nice and smooth, and the brushes look nice.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Just as info stated, great facial brush.  </li>
            <li>Remember to go lightly.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Good brushes, but mine tend to lose bristles frequently.</li>
            <li>They are natural bristles and feel good against the skin.</li>
            <li>Good facial brushes aren&#x27;t easy to find.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>My husband uses them to clean his face which helps keep ingrown hairs to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I feel clean as well as glowing.</li>
            <li>My post cleansing toner pad is completely clean now.</li>
            <li>The Bass brush is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Good quality brushes with the right stiffness for facial use.</li>
            <li>Though I use a Clairsonic pretty regularly, this is a good substitute when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li>gentle on my face and neck, easy grip while using.</li>
            <li>Thanks Resilient!!</li>
            <li>I have been using these brushes for a week or so, and I love them so far.</li>
            <li>They would be far better suited for body scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Only one person out of the three say that they liked them.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get used to, but I found the results worth it.  </li>
            <li>Good price, package neatly, arrived before expected.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit harder than I thought they would be, which is why I gave it 4-starts,  but with warm water they soften significantly.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Resilient Face Brush is just right.  </li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>but if you get the bristles in the hot water first it is not bad.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are of excellent quality, neither too soft nor too hard.</li>
            <li>But after many weeks, very satisfactory, still like new, and MUCH MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>You defiantly don&#x27;t want to push real hard on your face but for a light buffing it is great.</li>
            <li>(At first, it felt rather &amp;#34;scratchy.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I love these facial brushes.</li>
            <li>I find it a much better buy than you hand held battery operated facial scrubbers.</li>
            <li>started to shed chunks from the placement holes during my first use.</li>
            <li>The bristles collapsed after the first use.</li>
            <li>First day of use</li>
            <li>Love the facial brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to it, but the first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li>Love these facial brushes!</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this facial brush.</li>
            <li>I first use sugar scrub on my face then</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>love these little brushes so easy to use on face.</li>
            <li>I am using them to dry brush, but you have to go very lightly when you begin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the other two twice each and so far so good.</li>
            <li>No more to say - they are good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, the bristle head is just the right size to clean around your face and nose without being big an bulky.</li>
            <li>Dry brushing is healthy for circulation, lymphatic system, and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>These are intended for your face, but I can see them working ok for a full-body dry brushing if you are traveling.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels cleaner and smoother and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are made well and seem to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Giving my face a dry brush really get my blood flowing better as you can feel the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>Excellent for facial exfoliation - use dry and brush CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li>Not high quality brushes but cute and nice enough for gifting and for occasional use.</li>
            <li>These are well made brushes but are not at all gentle.</li>
            <li>Look forward to clear, shiny, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>However, once you begin to use it, they work very well.</li>
            <li>I thought they were unusually rough, but you learn to work with them and after a week I enjoyed using them.  </li>
            <li>These are a high quality set of brushes!  </li>
            <li>I love them for wet brushing with cleanser though.  </li>
            <li>The head is wide enough so that you get good coverage while washing.</li>
            <li>I purchased these originally for my acne prone teens, and since there was an extra one I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>It seemed a bit rough at first on my face but just push lightly</li>
            <li>They would be good for heels and elbows but certainly not good for use on the face, etc.</li>
            <li>One brush completely lost to tufts first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re sold in a set of 3 since the first one didn&#x27;t really last vey long.</li>
            <li>The bristles are somewhat tough for the face, they would be ideal for body brush ( on a larger size of course).</li>
            <li>and they also even skin tone by acting as a mild exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I thought about buying an electric face brush, but honestly, using plastic in my skincare ritual made me nervous (will chronic daily use result in absorption of BPA and other chemicals</li>
            <li>I love these little brushes.  </li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for the face but be careful they are a little rough.</li>
            <li>They feel very hard dry, wet with warm water and they soften just enough to feel great on any part of your body.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and natural, soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>The bristles, while being 100% natural, are very course and stiff--not soft, as described.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>This facial brush is exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is healthy for the face..</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be sensitive, so I was very careful to use circular motions, extremely light.  </li>
            <li>They might be a little too harsh if you have sensitive skin, but otherwise a good buy.</li>
            <li>Face feels so soft after using brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are not too hard-not too soft.</li>
            <li>I was used to a soft brush.</li>
            <li>They are soft but they still exfoliate my face well.</li>
            <li>A must-have for you, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural solution to rejuvenate your skin.</li>
            <li>Took one of the brushes out of the package and rubbed it on my arm and the 100% natural fibers were all over my arm and clothes.</li>
            <li>I am completely blown away by these brushes.</li>
            <li>So far I like this brush.</li>
            <li>but I use these every now and these when I need something a little bit more to get ride of stubborn dry spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I started dry brushing my face before showering and found my skin much softer after 1 use.  </li>
            <li>After doing a google search came upon a few different brushes that fit what I was looking for and decided to try these as I got 3.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>A little harder bristles than I expected for a facial brush but good quality.</li>
            <li>Well this brush was recommended by the individual and so far it is doing wonders for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Finally I get my facecloth wet and remove the soap and found lots of makeup coming off on the cloth even after splashing rinse water on my face first.</li>
            <li>As the week progressed I started using the brush in the shower with facial cleanser (younique), replacing the hot pink silicone scrubbers I picked up at sephora.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for dry brushing on your face.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft as long as you are not &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I do like them, but they lose quite a few bristles at first.</li>
            <li>So I came across info on using natural brushes for cleansing and dry brushing for your face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a soft dry brushing, then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li>I use one to dry brush my face first, then I use black soap and water with 2nd brush.  </li>

            <li> I was using the plastic/acrylic brush set for a while, but agree with another reviewer that I wanted something that would biodegrate or recycle easily.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right, and my skin on my face looks more healthy than before.</li>
            <li> I  love the brushes very much I do believe that my product goes on my face better and my face just seems to have a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference on the texture of my skin, the tone and color of my skin and how easily it absorbs products I use and how well moisturized it is.  </li>
            <li> Will enjoy trying them out</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable in your hand</li>
            <li> The wooden handles are nice and smooth, and the brushes look nice.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Just as info stated, great facial brush.  </li>
            <li> Remember to go lightly.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Good brushes, but mine tend to lose bristles frequently.</li>
            <li> They are natural bristles and feel good against the skin.</li>
            <li> Good facial brushes aren&#x27;t easy to find.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> My husband uses them to clean his face which helps keep ingrown hairs to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I feel clean as well as glowing.</li>
            <li> My post cleansing toner pad is completely clean now.</li>
            <li> The Bass brush is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Good quality brushes with the right stiffness for facial use.</li>
            <li> Though I use a Clairsonic pretty regularly, this is a good substitute when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li> gentle on my face and neck, easy grip while using.</li>
            <li> Thanks Resilient!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a week or so, and I love them so far.</li>
            <li> They would be far better suited for body scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Only one person out of the three say that they liked them.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get used to, but I found the results worth it.  </li>
            <li> Good price, package neatly, arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit harder than I thought they would be, which is why I gave it 4-starts,  but with warm water they soften significantly.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Resilient Face Brush is just right.  </li>
            <li> JUST RIGHT.  </li>
            <li> but if you get the bristles in the hot water first it is not bad.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are of excellent quality, neither too soft nor too hard.</li>
            <li> But after many weeks, very satisfactory, still like new, and MUCH MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> You defiantly don&#x27;t want to push real hard on your face but for a light buffing it is great.</li>
            <li> (At first, it felt rather &amp;#34;scratchy.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I love these facial brushes.</li>
            <li> I find it a much better buy than you hand held battery operated facial scrubbers.</li>
            <li> started to shed chunks from the placement holes during my first use.</li>
            <li> The bristles collapsed after the first use.</li>
            <li> First day of use</li>
            <li> Love the facial brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to it, but the first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li> Love these facial brushes!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this facial brush.</li>
            <li> I first use sugar scrub on my face then</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> love these little brushes so easy to use on face.</li>
            <li> I am using them to dry brush, but you have to go very lightly when you begin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other two twice each and so far so good.</li>
            <li> No more to say - they are good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Also, the bristle head is just the right size to clean around your face and nose without being big an bulky.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is healthy for circulation, lymphatic system, and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> These are intended for your face, but I can see them working ok for a full-body dry brushing if you are traveling.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels cleaner and smoother and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are made well and seem to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Giving my face a dry brush really get my blood flowing better as you can feel the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent for facial exfoliation - use dry and brush CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> Not high quality brushes but cute and nice enough for gifting and for occasional use.</li>
            <li> These are well made brushes but are not at all gentle.</li>
            <li> Look forward to clear, shiny, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> However, once you begin to use it, they work very well.</li>
            <li> I thought they were unusually rough, but you learn to work with them and after a week I enjoyed using them.  </li>
            <li> These are a high quality set of brushes!  </li>
            <li> I love them for wet brushing with cleanser though.  </li>
            <li> The head is wide enough so that you get good coverage while washing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these originally for my acne prone teens, and since there was an extra one I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit rough at first on my face but just push lightly</li>
            <li> They would be good for heels and elbows but certainly not good for use on the face, etc.</li>
            <li> One brush completely lost to tufts first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re sold in a set of 3 since the first one didn&#x27;t really last vey long.</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat tough for the face, they would be ideal for body brush ( on a larger size of course).</li>
            <li> and they also even skin tone by acting as a mild exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying an electric face brush, but honestly, using plastic in my skincare ritual made me nervous (will chronic daily use result in absorption of BPA and other chemicals</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.  </li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for the face but be careful they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> They feel very hard dry, wet with warm water and they soften just enough to feel great on any part of your body.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and natural, soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles, while being 100% natural, are very course and stiff--not soft, as described.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This facial brush is exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is healthy for the face..</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive, so I was very careful to use circular motions, extremely light.  </li>
            <li> They might be a little too harsh if you have sensitive skin, but otherwise a good buy.</li>
            <li> Face feels so soft after using brush</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard-not too soft.</li>
            <li> I was used to a soft brush.</li>
            <li> They are soft but they still exfoliate my face well.</li>
            <li> A must-have for you, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural solution to rejuvenate your skin.</li>
            <li> Took one of the brushes out of the package and rubbed it on my arm and the 100% natural fibers were all over my arm and clothes.</li>
            <li> I am completely blown away by these brushes.</li>
            <li> So far I like this brush.</li>
            <li> but I use these every now and these when I need something a little bit more to get ride of stubborn dry spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I started dry brushing my face before showering and found my skin much softer after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> After doing a google search came upon a few different brushes that fit what I was looking for and decided to try these as I got 3.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> A little harder bristles than I expected for a facial brush but good quality.</li>
            <li> Well this brush was recommended by the individual and so far it is doing wonders for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Finally I get my facecloth wet and remove the soap and found lots of makeup coming off on the cloth even after splashing rinse water on my face first.</li>
            <li> As the week progressed I started using the brush in the shower with facial cleanser (younique), replacing the hot pink silicone scrubbers I picked up at sephora.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for dry brushing on your face.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft as long as you are not &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I do like them, but they lose quite a few bristles at first.</li>
            <li> So I came across info on using natural brushes for cleansing and dry brushing for your face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a soft dry brushing, then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> I use one to dry brush my face first, then I use black soap and water with 2nd brush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ll buy these again when mine get old.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting very lightly at first if you&#x27;re beginning dry brushing for the first time, the bristles are a little stiff and rough on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Wash brush prior to using, this cleans and softens bristles making ready for your delicate facial skin.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT soft facial complexion brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, yet firm enough to properly exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to recommend the Bass brush over anything else so far.</li>
            <li> I just discovered dry body brushing and found these babies for facial brushing.  </li>
            <li> I keep mine out of shower, allowing it to dry completely, lasting longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft but firm enough that it massages while cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> but once you get it wet and use it a few times it softens up a bit but not too much.</li>
            <li> I use them in the shower under my arms and the back of my arms along with the back of my thighs to get rid of those pesky little kitchen bumps, plies they are easier to handle then the larger boar brushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to it, but my skin has completely changed.  </li>
            <li> Anyone capable of using these brushes on their face must have skin made of steel, because the bristles of these brushes are far too stiff to use on the face without causing serious irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the description and other reviews and they are going back.  </li>
            <li> When first used, the brush can feel a little stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> so I can hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> I never knew about dry brushing until I read it in a blog.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tough at first but gets softer with each use.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re wood and that I can get three for the price of a single name brand brush.</li>
            <li> These are a little rougher than the Bass brush I used previously and they lost a few bristles initially, but overall, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Bass brush there is actually no comparison.  </li>
            <li> But with a little time it softens enough to give you a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expected the bristles would fall of that soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased these several weeks ago and have used one of them everyday since.  </li>
            <li> The pink silicone scrubber couldn&#x27;t ever get ALL the dirt out.  </li>
            <li> I did not find them rough.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how old my face brush was until a few bristles fell out!!  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using the natural brushes for a week I have noticed a dramatic decrease in acne, and my deep set forehead wrinkles are noticeably tighter.</li>
            <li> No more individual bristles.  </li>
            <li> These give a firmer cleanse than the nylon bristles, which I feel were basically doing nothing other than applying soap onto my face.</li>
            <li> Britles were a little harder than I expected.</li>
            <li> It IS extremely rough exfoliation as well, so it would hurt a lot less if they were packed tighter.</li>
            <li> The brush removed the dead, dry skin</li>
            <li> I use these to dry brush my face, replacing the Bass brush I used in the shower which got musty after a few months.</li>
            <li> A little rough for face cleansing</li>
            <li> It is a little rough</li>
            <li> Initially the bristles are hard</li>
            <li> Not worth the little bit of money spent on them</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that said the brush was a bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> I previously was washing my face with my fingers using the  2 minute method that Sonicare instructs.  </li>
            <li> I just deleted my previous review.  </li>
            <li> I humbly apologize to anyone who made a purchase based on my previous favorable 5 star review.  </li>
            <li> These little brushes work well.  </li>
            <li> I only used a couple of times but I have to say the bristles seem too tough.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something for my face to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not use everyday~</li>
            <li> They are harsh and should not be used on the face, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a firm brush</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my face.  </li>
            <li> I found it a bit too harsh.  </li>
            <li> These brushes need to be dried thoroughly in between uses.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are stiff and harsh.  </li>
            <li> Bristles a little to harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> Do not press down hard but just let them glide across your skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I went to my local dollar (tree) store and bought others, sadly, with plastic handles and bristles.  </li>
            <li> Way to harsh for the face!  </li>
            <li> Before they arrived I saw some negative reviews and wondered if they would be too stiff.</li>
            <li> but it does do the job jus have to learn not to press so hard.</li>
            <li> brush handle does not have an label imprint as pictured nor as thick and sturdy .Clearly</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the bristles didn&#x27;t stay as stiff as I thought they would after only two uses.</li>
            <li> The brush head is actually very small too, about 1.5 x 1 inch.</li>
            <li> They are very small.</li>
            <li> and you wind up with a matted mess of bristles and a useless brush.  </li>
            <li> but certainly not good for the complexion.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very delicate; they have to be put in place where nothing will fall and rest on it or the brissles will flatten out.</li>
            <li> After about just three weeks, the bristles were mushed into a solid mass, flattened against the wood base.  </li>
            <li> Soooo sorry, I spoke too soon.  </li>
            <li> , it was very painful.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great quality brushes!!</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles. Will enjoy trying them out</li>
            <li> Someone needs to learn how to count because there were only 2 in the package.</li>
            <li> These are well made brushes but are not at all gentle. They would be good for heels and elbows but certainly not good for use on the face, etc. I am going to keep them because I think they will be excellent for cleaning jewelry, brushing suede jackets and shoes, etc. but certainly not good for the complexion.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.  They arrived quickly and were exactly what I needed.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I was using the plastic/acrylic brush set for a while, but agree with another reviewer that I wanted something that would biodegrate or recycle easily. This brush made much more sense, and for the price they&#x27;re great. The bristles are a bit harder than I thought they would be, which is why I gave it 4-starts,  but with warm water they soften significantly. Got one for the husband too, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> One brush completely lost to tufts first use. I&#x27;ve used the other two twice each and so far so good. Operative words being &amp;#34;so far&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchases. The brushes are as advertised. I have used them for about 2 weeks and I can already tell a difference on my skin. I highly recommend this product for dry brushing on your face.</li>
            <li> A miracle pore exfoliator. Look forward to clear, shiny, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> gave on to daughter and grand daughter....great skin care tool</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. I was looking for something for my face to use everyday. They are wonderful, like the fact that they made of natural bristles.</li>
            <li> The description is what they said. The brush is soft as long as you are not &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;. I do not use everyday~</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is healthy for circulation, lymphatic system, and exfoliating.  These little brushes work well.  Had to get used to the feel of brushing my skin, but now I find it invigorating. (At first, it felt rather &amp;#34;scratchy.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Excellent for facial exfoliation - use dry and brush CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> I love these. The deal is definitely much better than what I had found in a nearby health store!</li>
            <li> Good brushes, but mine tend to lose bristles frequently.</li>
            <li> love these little brushes so easy to use on face.</li>
            <li> Face feels so soft after using brush</li>
            <li> I love the brushes ...but I only received 2, not the set of 3 as indicated.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a week or so, and I love them so far. The bristles are just right, and my skin on my face looks more healthy than before. The only improvement I would like to see is a hole in the handle so I can hang it up to dry. Other than that, I&#x27;ll buy these again when mine get old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give 2 1/2 stars.  I received these as a gift.  I only used a couple of times but I have to say the bristles seem too tough.  Compared to the Bass brush there is actually no comparison.  The Bass brush is the absolute best!  I have to recommend the Bass brush over anything else so far.</li>
            <li> I  love the brushes very much I do believe that my product goes on my face better and my face just seems to have a glow to it. Thank You</li>
            <li> I love these facial brushes. They do an excellent job of washing off makeup. Better yet, they do a great job of resurfacing my skin. My skin is smoother. It has removed tiny bumps from my forehead.  My skin looks better so my makeup looks better too. When first used, the brush can feel a little stiff and rough. But with a little time it softens enough to give you a thorough cleaning.  Also, the bristle head is just the right size to clean around your face and nose without being big an bulky. The handle is comfortable in your hand These facial brushes last a longer as well. I find it a much better buy than you hand held battery operated facial scrubbers.</li>
            <li> Very handy for washing face and even ears, love them</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for the face but be careful they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> These work great. Nice to have 3, so I can leave one in the dopp kit at all times. These are intended for your face, but I can see them working ok for a full-body dry brushing if you are traveling.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.</li>
            <li> A little rough for face cleansing but it does do the job jus have to learn not to press so hard.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  The bristles have good feel.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how old my face brush was until a few bristles fell out!!  Time to move on.  Resilient Face Brush is just right.  The bristles are not too hard-not too soft. JUST RIGHT.  I use one to dry brush my face first, then I use black soap and water with 2nd brush.  My face feels and looks great afterwards.  Highly recommended! Thanks Resilient!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat tough for the face, they would be ideal for body brush ( on a larger size of course). They probably will get softer with use though. However after using it about three times the bristles started to fall a part a bit. I wasn&#x27;t expected the bristles would fall of that soon. The wooden handles are nice and smooth, and the brushes look nice. Not high quality brushes but cute and nice enough for gifting and for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Useful size, good quality complexion brushes.Easy to clean and pleasant to use. No more to say - they are good value for the price.</li>
            <li> These are NOT soft facial complexion brushes.  They are harsh and should not be used on the face, in my opinion. They would be far better suited for body scrubbing.  They HURT to use.  I bought these based on the description and other reviews and they are going back.  The brush head is actually very small too, about 1.5 x 1 inch.</li>
            <li> They would be perfect, if the bristles were packed tighter together.  They are spread out and any pressure applied to give a good scrubbing just crushes them and you wind up with a matted mess of bristles and a useless brush.  It IS extremely rough exfoliation as well, so it would hurt a lot less if they were packed tighter.</li>
            <li> These are a little rougher than the Bass brush I used previously and they lost a few bristles initially, but overall, they work very well. I use these to dry brush my face, replacing the Bass brush I used in the shower which got musty after a few months. I like that they&#x27;re wood and that I can get three for the price of a single name brand brush.</li>
            <li> Me Andy husband LOVE THESE! I have a clarisonic but I use these every now and these when I need something a little bit more to get ride of stubborn dry spots on my cheeks. I use them in the shower under my arms and the back of my arms along with the back of my thighs to get rid of those pesky little kitchen bumps, plies they are easier to handle then the larger boar brushes. My husband uses them to clean his face which helps keep ingrown hairs to a minimum. They feel very hard dry, wet with warm water and they soften just enough to feel great on any part of your body. Great for your feet and toes also.</li>
            <li> Feel great and make my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that said the brush was a bit harsh.  It is a little rough but if you get the bristles in the hot water first it is not bad.  You defiantly don&#x27;t want to push real hard on your face but for a light buffing it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the brush.  It was a bit tough at first but gets softer with each use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. Recipient likes the brushes. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  I use them on my face several times a week and since it was a 3 pack I had some to share with friends.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I used one and so did two of my children.  Only one person out of the three say that they liked them. They do exfoliate but something about the bristle irritates my skin and the brush I used started to shed chunks from the placement holes during my first use.</li>
            <li> These are terrific facial brushes, especially after you&#x27;ve worn them in a bit and the bristles are softer.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and my skin has never felt smoother or softer! The bristles are so soft, yet firm enough to properly exfoliate my skin. Great Value!</li>
            <li> One for myself, one for my daughter and one for my grand-daughter. Good facial brushes aren&#x27;t easy to find. These are well made, (although I do find that wood tends to get mouldy sooner than plastic.) I chose wood brushes over plastic ones for environmental reasons. I feel the wood is better for the environment than plastic. The bristles are of excellent quality, neither too soft nor too hard. We use our brushes every day and have been extremely pleased with them. We will be buying them again from Resilient Beauty when time comes to replace them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are rougher than I would have liked. I was used to a soft brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles collapsed after the first use. They are very small. Shaq could use them as a toothbrush. I was looking for a firm brush but I&#x27;d do better with shower brush that you can get from walmart. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I am loving my face brush set! I am using one and love to have two to spare. It seemed a bit rough at first on my face but just push lightly and it it perfect! The brush removed the dead, dry skin and I use it with my favorite cleanser. I feel clean as well as glowing.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that is ideal for face use .Bristles fell out initially and brush handle does not have an label imprint as pictured nor as thick and sturdy .Clearly an cheaper version made in China .</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes, the work well and have lasted awhile. They might be a little too harsh if you have sensitive skin, but otherwise a good buy.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on your face.</li>
            <li> Bristles too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a couple months now and LOVE the effect they&#x27;ve had on my complexion.  I previously was washing my face with my fingers using the  2 minute method that Sonicare instructs.  I thought about buying an electric face brush, but honestly, using plastic in my skincare ritual made me nervous (will chronic daily use result in absorption of BPA and other chemicals I did not want inside my body?).  So I came across info on using natural brushes for cleansing and dry brushing for your face.  After doing a google search came upon a few different brushes that fit what I was looking for and decided to try these as I got 3.  I have noticed a significant difference on the texture of my skin, the tone and color of my skin and how easily it absorbs products I use and how well moisturized it is.  Thinking of make a gift of my remaining 2 or just buying a set to gift someone I have in mind.</li>
            <li> Soooo sorry, I spoke too soon.  I just deleted my previous review.  Is my face red!  After about just three weeks, the bristles were mushed into a solid mass, flattened against the wood base.  No more individual bristles.  I humbly apologize to anyone who made a purchase based on my previous favorable 5 star review.  These are a complete waste of money. Their only value is as fire wood.  I threw mine away, (don&#x27;t have a fireplace) even the ones I had not used yet. Then I went to my local dollar (tree) store and bought others, sadly, with plastic handles and bristles.  But after many weeks, very satisfactory, still like new, and MUCH MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that they sell these in a lot of three. The brushes lose a lot of bristles initially that is why I gave it 4 stars. However, once you begin to use it, they work very well. They are made well and seem to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are stiff and harsh.  Way to harsh for the face!  More appropriate for scrubbing  your feet, or perhaps pots and pans.  Would not recommend these too anyone. And I do not have sensitive skin, these brushes are just coarse and rough.</li>
            <li> Never used a facial brush before.  First day of use I thought they were unusually rough, but you learn to work with them and after a week I enjoyed using them.  Great for cleaning oily parts of your face and they also even skin tone by acting as a mild exfoliant.  Do not press down hard but just let them glide across your skin.  Takes a bit to get used to, but I found the results worth it.  Wish they were slightly larger.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and natural, soft bristles.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Good deal. Britles were a little harder than I expected. But does the trick</li>
            <li> Loved this set! The brushes are a great quality and my face is looking great since I started using them. I was able to share them with my family since the set came with three brushes. What a great value!</li>
            <li> I do like them, but they lose quite a few bristles at first. Overall a good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> I use them in the shower and the bristles keep falling out. Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t use them in the shower?</li>
            <li> This facial brush is exactly what I was hoping for.  It&#x27;s not too soft but firm enough that it massages while cleaning your face. Initially the bristles are hard but once you get it wet and use it a few times it softens up a bit but not too much. The head is wide enough so that you get good coverage while washing.</li>
            <li> Like the way it makes my face feel after I use it.  It would be nice if there was a hole in the handle end so it could be hung on something in my shower.  Still satisfied with my purchase though.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the facial brushes. They are soft but they still exfoliate my face well.</li>
            <li> The bristles, while being 100% natural, are very course and stiff--not soft, as described. I&#x27;m getting used to it, but the first time I used it on my face, it was very painful.</li>
            <li> I like these face brushes and I like that they send 3 of them.  They are natural bristles and feel good against the skin.</li>
            <li> Love these facial brushes! Great for travel, so I don&#x27;t have to lug my electronic one. My skin looks more youthful and feels softer. I also use these on the back of my hands. A must-have for you, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural solution to rejuvenate your skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush on my face.  Though I use a Clairsonic pretty regularly, this is a good substitute when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  I am disappointed that the bristles didn&#x27;t stay as stiff as I thought they would after only two uses. If you&#x27;re looking for a soft dry brushing, then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> gentle on my face and neck, easy grip while using. easy to clean. Good price, package neatly, arrived before expected. Will reccomend</li>
            <li> Not as I&#x27;d hoped for.... Bristles a little to harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this facial brush. I will be giving these as gifts. Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they sounded like what I wanted. Before they arrived I saw some negative reviews and wondered if they would be too stiff. Well, they&#x27;re stiffer than if you are used to a nylon brush. I had one of those, and I always begin cleaning my face with a makeup remover cloth from Costco. Then I would wash my face with my nylon brush. Finally I get my facecloth wet and remove the soap and found lots of makeup coming off on the cloth even after splashing rinse water on my face first. I don&#x27;t have all of this residual makeup on my washcloth now. These give a firmer cleanse than the nylon bristles, which I feel were basically doing nothing other than applying soap onto my face.</li>
            <li> These are a high quality set of brushes!  I was very pleased at how nice they are.  I would recommend starting very lightly at first if you&#x27;re beginning dry brushing for the first time, the bristles are a little stiff and rough on dry skin.  I love them for wet brushing with cleanser though.  I am using them to dry brush, but you have to go very lightly when you begin.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes with the right stiffness for facial use.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my face.  I first use sugar scrub on my face then J&amp;J orange liquid face wash on this Facial brush. Works great! Do buy it.</li>
            <li> A little harder bristles than I expected for a facial brush but good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased these several weeks ago and have used one of them everyday since.  I am very pleased with the softness of the bristles and the size of the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Took one of the brushes out of the package and rubbed it on my arm and the 100% natural fibers were all over my arm and clothes. They would only last 3-4 weeks with daily use ..imo. Not worth the little bit of money spent on them so I will be sending them back ASAP.</li>
            <li> I just discovered dry body brushing and found these babies for facial brushing.  I&#x27;m a beauty fiend and will try anything to improve my skin, especially on my face. I am completely blown away by these brushes. I started dry brushing my face before showering and found my skin much softer after 1 use.  As the week progressed I started using the brush in the shower with facial cleanser (younique), replacing the hot pink silicone scrubbers I picked up at sephora. This brush removes ALL the dirt &amp; makeup from my face. My post cleansing toner pad is completely clean now. The pink silicone scrubber couldn&#x27;t ever get ALL the dirt out.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using the natural brushes for a week I have noticed a dramatic decrease in acne, and my deep set forehead wrinkles are noticeably tighter. The claims of stimulating collagen and circulation seem legit. I will recommend and purchase for my sister and friends. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is healthy for the face.. I found it a bit too harsh.  I recommend this instead:  http://goo.gl/dsYXmk  they are from edible vegetable roots. Leaves my face glowing!</li>
            <li> Just as info stated, great facial brush.  Wash brush prior to using, this cleans and softens bristles making ready for your delicate facial skin.  It is really wonderful, feels great.  Remember to go lightly.  I keep mine out of shower, allowing it to dry completely, lasting longer.  Enjoy.  I am.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! I purchased these originally for my acne prone teens, and since there was an extra one I decided to try it for myself. My skin tends to be sensitive, so I was very careful to use circular motions, extremely light.  It took a few days to get used to it, but my skin has completely changed.  I do think it removes all traces of makeup, exfoliates, and stimulates collagen.  These brushes need to be dried thoroughly in between uses.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with how using these brushes has improved the texture of my skin. I did not find them rough. My skin definitely feels cleaner and smoother and they are easy to use. I like the size as well-easy for travel or if you don&#x27;t have a lot of bathroom space. Definitely a better clean and exfoliation than a washcloth! I am wondering how often you have to change the brushes and/or wash them?</li>
            <li> I never knew about dry brushing until I read it in a blog. Well this brush was recommended by the individual and so far it is doing wonders for my face and neck. Giving my face a dry brush really get my blood flowing better as you can feel the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Facial Brushes quality came as described and on time.</li>
            <li> Anyone capable of using these brushes on their face must have skin made of steel, because the bristles of these brushes are far too stiff to use on the face without causing serious irritation.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very delicate; they have to be put in place where nothing will fall and rest on it or the brissles will flatten out. That happened with one of mine. I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re sold in a set of 3 since the first one didn&#x27;t really last vey long.</li>
            <li> So far I like this brush. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to using an exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> These bristles are too ruff for your face. I have had these for 1 month and the brush I have been using is already cracking around the edges.</li>
