            <li>My husband says this works great</li>
            <li>Otherwise works great.</li>
            <li>Handy as well is the fact that it&#x27;s anti-itch as well as anti-mosquito!</li>
            <li>We thought this would be good.</li>
            <li>this is a good product made in US</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly on mosquito and flea bites.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell but will be sticking with the orig oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to use something that isn&#x27;t industrial poison, and still get some benefit.</li>
            <li>I would definitively but again and in addition every skin so soft product has worked great for me!!!!</li>
            <li>I used this many years ago when it was marketed as a skin softener.  </li>
            <li>I think benadryl might work a hair better.</li>
            <li>Love that stuff</li>
            <li>and she was able to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I wish this had a more neutral smell to it.</li>
            <li>It works and I have never found a better product.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff - no smell, really works on ichy bug bites, and has helped keep the bugs away.  </li>
            <li>I think a cool damp cloth would have been more effective</li>
            <li>this product really keeps the bugs away, I can sit out on my deck again and enjoy the sunsets great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the product is still fabulous and my dog stopped itching, but that bottle.</li>
            <li>There is the strong smell of Eucalyptus or whatever.  </li>
            <li>working just fine keeping the bugs off</li>
            <li>This does precisely what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my poodles when they are itchy from the occasional flea.</li>
            <li>When you spray it, try not to get it on the floors as it is very slippery, oily feeling; though it feels wonderful on the skin and actually has a softening effect.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>She screamed every time we put it on her and her skin flared up bright red.</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad at all although the spray nozzle at times didn&#x27;t work at times.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick, but did not notice a difference in my sons bits or itching.  </li>
            <li>I love skin so soft products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that effective either, I covered myself in it before going outside and still got two mosquito bites!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I am having better success with a different product.</li>
            <li>Check the Avon website, first sentence in their description advises that it doesn&#x27;t repel bugs.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I head about this product when I was in the Marine Corps and for the last many years always keep a container of the Avon Bug Guard and Relief Spray.  </li>
            <li>i found it did not stop the itch with the first application</li>
            <li>This product works really well!</li>
            <li>Now they call it for what it really is.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>After getting ready for bed, she was still itching.  </li>
            <li>They really did not scratch the bites.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>put this on and head for the garden when they really feed on you...</li>
            <li>works well but now very pricey.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>We got this spray for the summer and although it smells decent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, the lid/spray leaks and drips no matter way.</li>
            <li>Skin So Soft really repels mosquitoes plus this help relief the itch.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing works on my 4-year old&#x27;s mosquito bites, except for this.</li>
            <li>we live in Hawaii...</li>
            <li>Works so much better than the usual chemical products you find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>, your skin is SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>Shipping took a very long time, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it does wear off pretty fast, but I think the less chemicals makes reapplying worth it.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, and has significantly less chemicals then most of the other types of bug guard.  </li>
            <li>what can you say about skin so soft it is</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist for our young child.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, Skin So Soft is still the Dog spray</li>
            <li>I prefer this product by far.</li>
            <li>We used skin so soft bath oil years before it was advertised as a bug guard.  </li>
            <li>Menthol, the active ingredient in the spray, is soothing and cooling to all kinds of skin itches or mild inflammations.  </li>
            <li>not strong enough it works for the most part.</li>
            <li>Also, it is small enough to fit in a purse when traveling around!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very itchy dry skin patches.</li>
            <li>This product works great, my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle.</li>
            <li>Not only did it keep the bugs away but left my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It works and smells good instead of the regular  spray that burns and stinks......</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One of the few options available for small children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really worked and the pump spray leaked/dripped when used.</li>
            <li> Only gave minimal &amp; short term relief.</li>
            <li> This was minor issue to me as I just used another nozzle spray or spread it using my hands...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to repel mosquitos, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for the mosquito&#x27;s in Asia.</li>
            <li> Not Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It also works on other irritated skin itches.</li>
            <li> We live in AZ, so we&#x27;re not in the mosquito zone per se, however there is a small window during the late summer when we are pestered.</li>
            <li> but it seems less efficient than the spray can</li>
            <li> I would buy it by the liter and add water to it, half and half.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed a little bit of this product on the bite and the itching stop</li>
            <li> Works OK as a repellent but not for longer than 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> Its so wasteful and not to mention messy.</li>
            <li> Some sneak in but are taken care of in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> works on the bugs / no see-ums and also on the itch from the previous bites!  </li>
            <li> It does have a little sting but it lasts no more than 2 or 3 seconds</li>
            <li> this stuff works  spay a little on an ant hill and watch !</li>
            <li> Much less expensive thn Avon just hope its not old</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed, especially after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> For a harmless-to-humans bug repellent, this one is not bad.</li>
            <li> The bottle sucks.</li>
            <li> The product came dirty on the outside.</li>
            <li> Too bad it only lasts 15 or 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> useless</li>
            <li> I mentioned that spray bottle as being useless enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> We got very few however, because we wore the Mosquito Repellent Wristband Bracelet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for an overseas trip, and unless the bugs in Greece are immune to this aroma, we got bit up like crazy.</li>
            <li> it was a bug repellent AND itch relief spray.</li>
            <li> I still got bitten but the smell isn&#x27;t horrible and when you shower it off</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> what can you say about skin so soft it is awesome wife loves it smells great fast shipping well packaged it works bettern than off according to my wife</li>
            <li> This product works great, my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle. We live in AZ, so we&#x27;re not in the mosquito zone per se, however there is a small window during the late summer when we are pestered. It&#x27;s nice to be able to use something that isn&#x27;t industrial poison, and still get some benefit. Handy as well is the fact that it&#x27;s anti-itch as well as anti-mosquito!</li>
            <li> works on the bugs / no see-ums and also on the itch from the previous bites!  When nothing else soothes the itch, this works.</li>
            <li> this stuff works  spay a little on an ant hill and watch !</li>
            <li> Not Exactly what I was looking for.  The pump is o.k. but it seems less efficient than the spray can</li>
            <li> Skin So Soft really repels mosquitoes plus this help relief the itch.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend to my friends.  We heard about it from our pediatrician.  One of the few options available for small children.</li>
            <li> Now this is a mosquito product that works.  I used this many years ago when it was marketed as a skin softener.  Now they call it for what it really is.</li>
            <li> I love skin so soft products</li>
            <li> Product did everything it claimed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would definitively but again and in addition every skin so soft product has worked great for me!!!!</li>
            <li> This does NOT repel bugs, it just treats the itch afterwards!  I purchased it based upon the Amazon description which claim that it does.  Check the Avon website, first sentence in their description advises that it doesn&#x27;t repel bugs.</li>
            <li> this product really keeps the bugs away, I can sit out on my deck again and enjoy the sunsets great.</li>
            <li> I think benadryl might work a hair better. I liked the smell but will be sticking with the orig oil. Love that stuff and it works to repell bugs!</li>
            <li> One spray and the itch is gone!!! Works amazingly on mosquito and flea bites. It does have a little sting but it lasts no more than 2 or 3 seconds and then just relief!</li>
            <li> Works great to stop the itching. Works OK as a repellent but not for longer than 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for our young child. I&#x27;m not sure if it really worked and the pump spray leaked/dripped when used.</li>
            <li> This does precisely what it says it will.  When you spray it, try not to get it on the floors as it is very slippery, oily feeling; though it feels wonderful on the skin and actually has a softening effect.  There is the strong smell of Eucalyptus or whatever.  Always makes me feel like a Koala bear since I spray this and I feel like I am a bulls eye for Koala bears to come snuggle up to me and start biting my ears or something.  Either way definitely works though I wish they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> working just fine keeping the bugs off</li>
            <li> The bottle sucks. If you spray, it just dribbles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the product is still fabulous and my dog stopped itching, but that bottle. Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work, it leaks all over.&lt;br /&gt;You should do something about that useless nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Skin So Soft is still the Dog spray I remember.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if it works on people. I used to use the lotion on a dog way back when. It worked as a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Have I mentioned that spray bottle as being useless enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. The product is great, hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> We got this spray for the summer and although it smells decent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, the lid/spray leaks and drips no matter way. Its so wasteful and not to mention messy.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, and has significantly less chemicals then most of the other types of bug guard.  The only problem is it does wear off pretty fast, but I think the less chemicals makes reapplying worth it.</li>
            <li> bottle leaks when I spray it, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to repel mosquitos, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  great price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for the mosquito&#x27;s in Asia.</li>
            <li> not strong enough it works for the most part.</li>
            <li> Was a lot smaller than I had expected.picture is deceaving.</li>
            <li> I use this on my horse&#x27;s tail because she has allergic reaction to culicoides (no-see-ums) bites and gets so itchy. This is the only thing I have tried that seems to make a difference. I only wish that they made this in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps the bugs off and away. Some sneak in but are taken care of in a few minutes. I would recommend to anyone. I used this when I was a youngster. Now 64.</li>
            <li> My daughter got a couple of bug bites while out playing one night. After getting ready for bed, she was still itching.  I sprayed a little bit of this product on the bite and the itching stop and she was able to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Menthol, the active ingredient in the spray, is soothing and cooling to all kinds of skin itches or mild inflammations.  Too bad it only lasts 15 or 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Every flying biting insect seems to eat my daughter. And there was no exception using this product. I guessi will keep trying</li>
            <li> Much less expensive thn Avon just hope its not old</li>
            <li> Only gave minimal &amp; short term relief. I think a cool damp cloth would have been more effective</li>
            <li> I wish this had a more neutral smell to it. It&#x27;s not all that effective either, I covered myself in it before going outside and still got two mosquito bites!</li>
            <li> Came in bottle without spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> This was great for when my children got bitten.  They really did not scratch the bites.  We got very few however, because we wore the Mosquito Repellent Wristband Bracelet.  They come ten in a pack. Worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Arrived quick, but did not notice a difference in my sons bits or itching.  I am having better success with a different product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! No bug bites while in Punta Cana!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very itchy dry skin patches. We thought this would be good. Not so much. She screamed every time we put it on her and her skin flared up bright red.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product - it helped with the problem I was experiencing. I did not realize when I ordered it that it was a travel-sized bottle, but that was my misunderstanding.  The shipping was excellent - I had the product within a day of ordering it (which was wonderful.) I will order again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> We suffer from thoes tiny sand fleas and they itch like there is no tomorrow.  I head about this product when I was in the Marine Corps and for the last many years always keep a container of the Avon Bug Guard and Relief Spray.  It works and I have never found a better product.  It keeps the bugs off and if they do bite, it sooth the itching.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the usual chemical products you find in the stores.  I prefer this product by far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Absolutely nothing works on my 4-year old&#x27;s mosquito bites, except for this. It is amazing and I highly recommend it. It also works on other irritated skin itches. I order several bottles at a time so I can keep it stationed in multiple places. Otherwise she&#x27;ll scratch her bites to infection. It instantly soothes.</li>
            <li> It works and smells good instead of the regular  spray that burns and stinks......this is a good product made in US</li>
            <li> the itch relief needs to be stronger i found it did not stop the itch with the first application</li>
            <li> This itch relief spray lasted me 1 week spraying it on 3-4 times daily. The smell was not bad at all although the spray nozzle at times didn&#x27;t work at times. This was minor issue to me as I just used another nozzle spray or spread it using my hands... Overall, I would buy this product again especially when traveling to areas where there I can get bit my mosquitos.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a bug repellent AND itch relief spray. It is not. It is only an itch relief spray. THE WAY THE ADVERTISEMENT IS LABELED, IT WAS ABIT DECIEVING.</li>
            <li> My husband says this works great and he would buy it again!</li>
            <li> ...aloha bugs...we live in Hawaii...put this on and head for the garden when they really feed on you...stop being a blood meal...use this product...</li>
            <li> This product neither repelled bugs nor soothed my itching bug bites. I was so very disappointed, especially after reading the positive reviews. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great on my poodles when they are itchy from the occasional flea.</li>
            <li> We used skin so soft bath oil years before it was advertised as a bug guard.  I would buy it by the liter and add water to it, half and half.  It would last for years.  works well but now very pricey.</li>
            <li> Love it! It works well to stop the itching for my kids who travelled to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff.  Shipping took a very long time, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> For a harmless-to-humans bug repellent, this one is not bad. I still got bitten but the smell isn&#x27;t horrible and when you shower it off, your skin is SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> Really works. The product came dirty on the outside. Otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> Keeps the bugs away, but don&#x27;t buy if you expect it to smell like &amp;#34;Skin so soft.&amp;#34; It smells like bug spray. Defeated my purpose of seeking it out and buying.</li>
            <li> This product works really well! We took it with us on a trip to Brazil and it kept all of the mosquitoes away when everyone else was getting bitten. It was a total life saver! Also, it is small enough to fit in a purse when traveling around! On top of all that, it smells really good too! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great stuff - no smell, really works on ichy bug bites, and has helped keep the bugs away.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Not only did it keep the bugs away but left my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I bought this for an overseas trip, and unless the bugs in Greece are immune to this aroma, we got bit up like crazy.</li>
