            <li>Amazing product...if you are on a budget and can&#x27;t afford Anastasia...this is definitely 2nd best!!</li>
            <li>have blonde hair and very light eye brows, this the perfect shade to color in my brows!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS -</li>
            <li>I THINK YOU COULD HAVE BETTER CONTROLL OF THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Yes, better then anastasia brows and bullet proof brows.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The blonde color is perfect.</li>
            <li>If you want them darker then you use more.</li>
            <li>With an angled brush I am able to get some great strokes that give my brows a natural look.</li>
            <li>and this is great so far.</li>
            <li>but this stuff makes them look great and about as natural as its gonna get .</li>
            <li>so easy to apply, just use spooly here and there between strokes.</li>
            <li>easy to use and stays on</li>
            <li>I HAVE MEDIUM BROWN BROWS AND THE BLONDE COLOR WORKS GREAT FOR ME</li>
            <li>I wish there were a lighter blond color available.  </li>
            <li>This product does go on heavy, to a light hand is best.</li>
            <li>I need to practice for the right technique</li>
            <li>I need to figure out the right tool for applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used powders, gels, pencils, and this is by far my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>if you put it on the back of your hand, you won&#x27;t be able to take it off.</li>
            <li>you get to much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found products in the past that are better than others, but usually super pricey.</li>
            <li>Omg live this so so much!</li>
            <li>brown would have been too dark for sure.  </li>
            <li>It took me 2 tries to get the hang of applying it, but now it is easy.</li>
            <li>It also does not smudge, and I have decently oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used practically everything, from high end brands like Anastasia brow dip and the mechanical pencil.</li>
            <li>This really fills in her eyebrows and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>color is exactly like my ashy blonde brows, 100% match.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been on the constant hunt for the next big eyebrow thing, and more importantly something that looks good with platinum hair without being too dark and fake looking.</li>
            <li>If you pretty much have no brows left, you understand the constant anxiety that your brows are going to come off.</li>
            <li>squeezy plastic tube holds a huge amount, it won&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was dunked under water, and squirted with a water gun directly in the face several times.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The blonde is dark enough for my ash blonde hair color...</li>
            <li> I have a darker brow naturally even though I&#x27;m blonde, so I use the blonde as a base, and the chocolate as filled strokes.</li>
            <li> Only down side is it dries to a grayish tone.</li>
            <li> you need so little it will last forever.</li>
            <li> : Blonde is very dark.</li>
            <li> , one of my eyebrows is literally a half inch long</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look as if I have dark catapillers on my face.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;ll make them too dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with the most terrible barely there eyebrows not joking</li>
            <li> YOU WANT TO USE AND LESS WASTE.</li>
            <li> so I squeeze a little on a plastic eyeshadow case before applying.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want mine very dark.</li>
            <li> I remove it with coconut oil (need a few attempts).</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> Use a very little bit.</li>
            <li> You use very little.</li>
            <li> Like a small dot</li>
            <li> My daughter couldn&#x27;t find the blond in the store but as usual, I found it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> and i mean a very small dot to do its job.</li>
            <li> I find I have to use a very small amount</li>
            <li> I grabbed a couple of shades of these and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I looked in the mirror</li>

            <li> Amazing product...if you are on a budget and can&#x27;t afford Anastasia...this is definitely 2nd best!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS - I HAVE MEDIUM BROWN BROWS AND THE BLONDE COLOR WORKS GREAT FOR ME - I WISH THAT IT WAS IN A VESSEL WITH A LID - TUB INSTEAD OF A TUBE - I THINK YOU COULD HAVE BETTER CONTROLL OF THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT YOU WANT TO USE AND LESS WASTE.</li>
            <li> The blonde is dark enough for my ash blonde hair color...brown would have been too dark for sure.  This stuff stays on! Use a very little bit.</li>
            <li> I needed something bullet proof for the beach. wow i&#x27;m impressed. color is exactly like my ashy blonde brows, 100% match. there&#x27;s no warmth in it at all. perfect cool taupe color. so easy to apply, just use spooly here and there between strokes. stays on like a tattoo. if you put it on the back of your hand, you won&#x27;t be able to take it off. I learned my lesson so I squeeze a little on a plastic eyeshadow case before applying. you can swim in it, sweat in it and it doesn&#x27;t come off. I remove it with coconut oil (need a few attempts). squeezy plastic tube holds a huge amount, it won&#x27;t dried out. you need so little it will last forever. one of the only brow products that colors hair&amp;skin!</li>
            <li> I wish there were a lighter blond color available.  I find I have to use a very small amount or I&#x27;m in danger of having Groucho brows.  Otherwise it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have sensitive skin and this is great so far. It took me 2 tries to get the hang of applying it, but now it is easy. I use it everyday and it stays in place all day. I work in a restaurant in Florida, so I sweat almost all day and this stayed on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair and very light eye brows, this the perfect shade to color in my brows!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! May take time to get your technique but after you do you&#x27;re good to go!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I got on specifically to review this product, because of how impressed I am with it. If you pretty much have no brows left, you understand the constant anxiety that your brows are going to come off. This is me. I&#x27;ve found products in the past that are better than others, but usually super pricey. I grabbed a couple of shades of these and was skeptical. I&#x27;m blown away at the staying power. I recently went to a pool party. I was dunked under water, and squirted with a water gun directly in the face several times. As soon as I could, I made a beeline for the bathroom to redo my brows. I was shocked when I looked in the mirror and they were still there, in great shape! With an angled brush I am able to get some great strokes that give my brows a natural look. I have a darker brow naturally even though I&#x27;m blonde, so I use the blonde as a base, and the chocolate as filled strokes. I cannot recommend these highly enough, and they last forever, I bought them months ago and are still using them. For $8! What??</li>
            <li> This is my affordable alternative from my Anastasia obsession.</li>
            <li> Stays on great. I need to practice for the right technique so I don&#x27;t look as if I have dark catapillers on my face. I need to figure out the right tool for applying.</li>
            <li> Yes, better then anastasia brows and bullet proof brows. Only water proof brow liner I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t come off with sweat, swimming, humidity  or the shower. You have intentionally wash it off with soap to get it off. Only down side is it dries to a grayish tone.</li>
            <li> Pros: This stuff doesn&#x27;t come off&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Blonde is very dark.</li>
            <li> Omg live this so so much! The only downside is of you get to much then it&#x27;ll make them too dark and I don&#x27;t want mine very dark.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s just like the aqua brow from make up forever</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Really a great product. I&#x27;ve been cursed with the most terrible barely there eyebrows not joking , one of my eyebrows is literally a half inch long and I have to paint BOTH on every day but this stuff makes them look great and about as natural as its gonna get . I baught the blond.</li>
            <li> easy to use and stays on</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been on the constant hunt for the next big eyebrow thing, and more importantly something that looks good with platinum hair without being too dark and fake looking. The blonde color is perfect. This is it for me. I have called off my hunt for anything else. I&#x27;ve used practically everything, from high end brands like Anastasia brow dip and the mechanical pencil. I&#x27;ve used powders, gels, pencils, and this is by far my absolute favorite. You need just the tiniest dot and a good angled brush for the perfect brow. This product does go on heavy, to a light hand is best. It also does not smudge, and I have decently oily skin. This will last all day without needing to reapply it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to work with, even for this beginner!</li>
            <li> If you want something that stays put this is it. Wow! This tube will last a very long time. You use very little. Like a small dot and i mean a very small dot to do its job. If you want them darker then you use more. WILL NOT RUB OFF.  UNTIL YOU TAKE IT OFF. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My daughter couldn&#x27;t find the blond in the store but as usual, I found it on amazon.  This really fills in her eyebrows and looks completely natural.</li>
