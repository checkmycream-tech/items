            <li>this perfume smells great....</li>
            <li>but it was a great price</li>
            <li>But was in great shape and I would buy it again from this company.</li>
            <li>and it still smells just as good as a fancy packaged one...</li>
            <li>This is a good perfume if you like to smell like cotton-candy, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Good for daytime wear.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had it and a fellow co-worker and my self loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile, sexy, feminine, beautiful and unless it&#x27;s a gift, get the tester version.</li>
            <li>I love this scent!</li>
            <li>Men love smelling it on a woman!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I have received so many wonderful compliments on this particular perfume that it has been my perfume of choice now for about 3 years.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t come with box or top because it is a tester bottle for stores</li>
            <li>most everyone will love you in this stuff:)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t have a top.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>In LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE TOILETTE SPRAY, ONE OF MY FORVORITE SPRAYS.</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE IT    </li>
            <li>I have had so many people (men and women of all ages),</li>
            <li>Ahhhhh I love this stuff smells just like cotton candy</li>
            <li>Must have :)</li>
            <li>This perfume is a true tease and men just love it!</li>
            <li>I ordered the tester so I didn&#x27;t get the whole candy- looking canister thing which I can easily and happily do without, and by the way-</li>
            <li>Very sweet like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>For this reason I would think that the product would be more credible.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li>Very sweet light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love sweet sents</li>
            <li>I normally love sweet fruity scents (ie.</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>Very seductive yet innocent!</li>
            <li>is that?\\&quot; SO light and cotton candy</li>
            <li>would definately recommand for someone if you like sweet smelling perfumes that aren&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>It came a day after the original arrival end date.  </li>
            <li>I saved almost $20 by buying it on Amazon as opposed to Kohl&#x27;s, where I originally saw it.</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>because oh my GOSH I cannot STAND that strong, strong licorice smell that is has when first sprayed.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to smell good and not offend others, I highly recommend this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This my favorite perfume and whenever I wear it someone always wants to know \\&quot;what perfume</li>
            <li>&quot; But then, that licorice scent settles into a sweet cotton candy with a vanilla background.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.  </li>
            <li>i love my pink sugar...just wish i had a top for it to travel with it!</li>
            <li>I rarely put on anything else.</li>
            <li>This perfume does smell exactly what it&#x27;s called - sugar, but there&#x27;s something about it, that has such a nice undertone.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a fantastic and fun, sugary sweet but not TOO sweet experience and trust</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume because it is sweet but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery as well!</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit like licorice when first sprayed.</li>
            <li>I have turned so many people on to Pink Sugar, that I should be getting some kind of kick back!</li>
            <li>Sweet, but sarcastic.</li>
            <li>tester\\&quot; text on the back was ridiculously easy to scratch off</li>
            <li>Very springy/early summer wear.</li>
            <li>Really girly.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really complain for the price, but it seems like a rip off to ship tester products.</li>
            <li>I will defiantly buy Pink Sugar again once I run out. :)</li>
            <li>THANKS  AWR</li>
            <li>I am sensitive towards most perfumes - I&#x27;ve had instant headaches because some perfumes were just too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says it is, a new tester.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this fragrance than any other scent I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>This was even better because we paid alot less than what she paid in the store.</li>
            <li>I love pairing this delicate scent with edgy, stylish clothing for a mysteriously sweet look.</li>
            <li>Seriously, everyone loves this stuff... especially the men in my life- which is not so suprising as it is no secret that men tend to love sweet and foody fragrances.</li>
            <li>When I ordered, the description said new.</li>
            <li>Very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>but Pink Sugar is way to sweet for me.</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all, I would HAVE to give this product 4 stars even if I hated it just because of how many compliments it has garnered me and my taste in fragrances!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same thing-not watered down or anything- a sweet, preppy perfume.</li>
            <li>but wow, to me it is just naseauting.</li>
            <li>I tried this perfume by mistake and otherwise would&#x27;ve never even looked at it, because the bottle reminded me so much of those little girls store with Hello Kitty backpacks and strawberry lip glosses.</li>

            <li> but the principle stinks, two stars for lacking a more clear/reassuring description.</li>
            <li> &quot; smell, I totally recommend Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> The perfume came with no top and was clearly very old.</li>
            <li> But once I found Pink Sugar, I have stuck with this scent.  </li>
            <li> That may sound weird, but it does!</li>
            <li> I hate to give the product a single star as I love the fragrance...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaks when I spray it, it doesn&#x27;t happen every time but when it does it can be quiet messy.</li>
            <li> I found that it also blends well with other scents adding a little naughty kick.  </li>
            <li> However I am sadly disappointed to say the package arrived in a barely REPACKAGED box missing its cap and very clearly labeled TESTER, DO NOT SELL!!!</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Not strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come in a case, it was just the bottle with no top.</li>
            <li> , so I always remember to spray some on at least 20 minutes beore</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t hate Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and this will alter my Amazon shopping in the future.  </li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, but</li>
            <li> whenever I wear it my boyfriend goes crazy!!!</li>

            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon itself, not a \\&quot;seller\\&quot;.  For this reason I would think that the product would be more credible.  However I am sadly disappointed to say the package arrived in a barely REPACKAGED box missing its cap and very clearly labeled TESTER, DO NOT SELL!!! I am unsure if this product was truly a used tester, or unused but, sold anyway... I am in the process of looking into this.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and this will alter my Amazon shopping in the future.  I hate to give the product a single star as I love the fragrance...but the principle stinks, two stars for lacking a more clear/reassuring description.</li>
            <li> Ahhh... the best perfume ever (well, besides harujuku g)! It&#x27;s versatile, sexy, feminine, beautiful and unless it&#x27;s a gift, get the tester version. It&#x27;s the exact same thing-not watered down or anything- a sweet, preppy perfume. I love pairing this delicate scent with edgy, stylish clothing for a mysteriously sweet look. The best! A must!</li>
            <li> this perfume smells great....didn&#x27;t come with box or top because it is a tester bottle for stores but it was a great price and it still smells just as good as a fancy packaged one...would definately recommand for someone if you like sweet smelling perfumes that aren&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, I would HAVE to give this product 4 stars even if I hated it just because of how many compliments it has garnered me and my taste in fragrances! Seriously, everyone loves this stuff... especially the men in my life- which is not so suprising as it is no secret that men tend to love sweet and foody fragrances. That being said, I don&#x27;t hate Pink Sugar. I ordered the tester so I didn&#x27;t get the whole candy- looking canister thing which I can easily and happily do without, and by the way- the \\&quot;do not sell- tester\\&quot; text on the back was ridiculously easy to scratch off so that&#x27;s not a problem at all. The bottle itself is very, very cute and it feels awesome in my hand. That may sound weird, but it does! The only reason I had to give it the 4 stars is because oh my GOSH I cannot STAND that strong, strong licorice smell that is has when first sprayed. I think it wears off after about 10- 15 minutes but wow, to me it is just naseauting. I had read alot of reviews before purchasing though and knew to expect this, so I always remember to spray some on at least 20 minutes beore I know I&#x27;ll be running out the door. Other than that, this is a fantastic and fun, sugary sweet but not TOO sweet experience and trust me- most everyone will love you in this stuff:)</li>
            <li> I love sweet sents but I don&#x27;t like smelling like the candy store. This scent gives me that perfect balance. I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t have a top. It&#x27;ll be standing upright on my dresser so I don&#x27;t need one. The product is the same as what I purchased in Sephora but easier on my pockets.</li>
            <li> It came a day after the original arrival end date.  But was in great shape and I would buy it again from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a good perfume if you like to smell like cotton-candy, which I don&#x27;t. I normally love sweet fruity scents (ie. RalPh, Paris Hilton, Halloween) but Pink Sugar is way to sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I saved almost $20 by buying it on Amazon as opposed to Kohl&#x27;s, where I originally saw it. Who needs a cap and box anyway?!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is, a new tester. A great bargain when it costs $59 at Sephora! Why pay for \\&quot;fancy\\&quot;&#x27; packaging with savings like this? I love it!!!</li>
            <li> i love my pink sugar...just wish i had a top for it to travel with it!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Very sweet like cotton candy. Undertones of vanilla, caramel, frosting...so yummy. Smell lasts hours. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance. Men love smelling it on a woman!</li>
            <li> Very sweet light fragrance. In LOVE with it. Not strong or overpowering. Good for daytime wear. Very springy/early summer wear. If you do not care for softer fruity candy notes you will probably not like this scent. Really girly.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. A friend of mine had it and a fellow co-worker and my self loved it. We both ordered it through amazon. This was even better because we paid alot less than what she paid in the store.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I was receiving a tester. When I ordered, the description said new. When it was shipped, it was shipped as a tester. can&#x27;t really complain for the price, but it seems like a rip off to ship tester products. Also, NO CAP was included. Lame.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I wear it almost everyday. I get ton of complements. My only complaint is that it leaks when I spray it, it doesn&#x27;t happen every time but when it does it can be quiet messy. I will defiantly buy Pink Sugar again once I run out. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling product I have ever used. Every time I wear it I get asked what is that you are wearing. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE TOILETTE SPRAY, ONE OF MY FORVORITE SPRAYS. JUST LOVE IT    THANKS  AWR</li>
            <li> I have received so many wonderful compliments on this particular perfume that it has been my perfume of choice now for about 3 years. I rarely put on anything else. I highly recommend this perfume because it is sweet but not over powering. I am sensitive towards most perfumes - I&#x27;ve had instant headaches because some perfumes were just too much for me to handle. For anyone who wants to smell good and not offend others, I highly recommend this perfume.  Great, affordable price too!  Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> This my favorite perfume and whenever I wear it someone always wants to know \\&quot;what perfume is that?\\&quot; SO light and cotton candy like with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered! This product was just like the picture.  Very nice Quality! Fast Delivery as well! Smells Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Lisa</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever had. I get compliments on it all the time. It smells like sugar vanilla and cotton candy all in one! Eventhough it&#x27;s a tester it was fine. It didn&#x27;t come in a case, it was just the bottle with no top. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a gift I would try to find this perfume with all of its parts. Otherwise this is great! Love love LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li> Everyone who likes the scent of vanilla and sugar must get this.Very soft and feminine. Not overpowering at all. What a value.</li>
            <li> The perfume came with no top and was clearly very old. It has a strong alcohol smell.  Very disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I adore this scent! It is a perfect scent for Valentine&#x27;s. It does smell a bit like licorice when first sprayed. I thought \\&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to like this\\&quot; But then, that licorice scent settles into a sweet cotton candy with a vanilla background. Very seductive yet innocent!</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume by mistake and otherwise would&#x27;ve never even looked at it, because the bottle reminded me so much of those little girls store with Hello Kitty backpacks and strawberry lip glosses. This perfume does smell exactly what it&#x27;s called - sugar, but there&#x27;s something about it, that has such a nice undertone. It&#x27;s flirty, but mischievous. Sweet, but sarcastic. This perfume is a true tease and men just love it! I found that it also blends well with other scents adding a little naughty kick.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much.  I had tons of desinger perfumes and changed my scent by the day and my mood.  But once I found Pink Sugar, I have stuck with this scent.  I get more compliments on this fragrance than any other scent I have ever worn.  And for those that aren&#x27;t so into the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smell, I totally recommend Pink Sugar. It is a vanilla, cotton candy, type scent that is not overpowering, yet remains all day.  I have had so many people (men and women of all ages), stop me whereever I happen to be, and ask what fragrance I am wearing.  I have turned so many people on to Pink Sugar, that I should be getting some kind of kick back! hehehe  I recommend this to anyone from teenager to over the hill!  It&#x27;s wonderful and lasts.  It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh I love this stuff smells just like cotton candy whenever I wear it my boyfriend goes crazy!!! Must have :)</li>
