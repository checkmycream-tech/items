    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>While this product doesn&#x27;t produce perfect nails</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and a lot of the lighter pinks</li>
            <li>Good price also!</li>
            <li>Works great as your basecoat.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Essie nail care brand!</li>
            <li>I would say it works ok!  </li>
            <li>Love this basecoat!</li>
            <li>the color is nice, too.</li>
            <li>I would go so far as to say this was my best.</li>
            <li>Might be my favorite nail polish ever (although this isn&#x27;t a polish, per se).</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>that completes the looks with a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>It may not have been the cure, yet I am sure it was the integral aide in the travel.</li>
            <li>While it did smoothe my nails over, it effected all the polish I put on top.  </li>
            <li>love this basecoat.</li>
            <li>I use it as a lovely neutral/natural matte-ish polish, and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my nails feel when I use this.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and makes a good bond with the polish.</li>
            <li>Also my nails don&#x27;t chip as easily as they do without it.</li>
            <li>The ridges are gone and my nails are really strong.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really fill the gaps and ridges as well as I had hoped, but it has a nice semi mat finish that wears well.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make them stronger, but it does smooth out the look of the grooves and makes the nails look nicer.  </li>
            <li>This product put a layer on the nail that makes it a smooth surface for the nail polish.</li>
            <li>They comments that they look really smooth.</li>
            <li>This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for...helps provide that smooth finish...</li>
            <li>Thumbs look smooth as glass after adding my polish and topcoat.</li>
            <li>Def worth the money!</li>
            <li>So I rarely have any kind of a decent nail.</li>
            <li>This nearly compltely filled everything in (filled in all ridges perfectly, but the deeper dents caused by peeling was not completely smooth)</li>
            <li>So, if you have problem nails, it is certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li>this is a super fast drying product!</li>
            <li>First off the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>2 stars for the color since it looked pretty under a clear top coat, however, my manicure chipped in a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for little ridges but not for Deeper ridges.</li>
            <li>: dries as a dull matte surface--not too attractive if worn alone.</li>
            <li>Any nail polish will stay on longer if you put this on first.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with Essie.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Essie for their regular pastel polishes, Ballet Slippers being a favorite.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on.</li>
            <li>My nails look professional and smooth.</li>
            <li>One fast coat of this ridge-filler gives my nails a natural, smooth, even, matte tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was one of the best purchases I have ever made for my nails, and as I have psoriasis, I always wear nail polish or my bare nails actually hurt, so I go through a LOT of nail polish and have made many poor choices.</li>
            <li>This is the first filler I&#x27;ve found that really works.</li>
            <li>and they have been peeling a bit at the ends, leaving large dents in my nails.</li>
            <li>My pedicures usually last forever no matter what cheap polish i use, but it chipped within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very ridged nails</li>
            <li>I will say to use it with polish and it works , use it as a stand alone product and not so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very ridged nails and have tried all sorts of solutions.  </li>
            <li>Really like using it.</li>
            <li>though nothing really does.</li>
            <li>Nails turned out much better with this than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything would----it is better than any other produce I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Since I always use a couple of coats of Hard as Nails, the ridges filled in just fine.</li>
            <li>I mainly have ridges in my thumb nails.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; particularly on my thumbs.</li>
            <li>My nails are too much of a mess to use nail polish on top that would draw attention to them.</li>
            <li>Secondly, works exactly as described,  and then some!</li>
            <li>The color is just enough to look natural, but also enough of a nail color change for me that I wouldn&#x27;t want to add another color on top.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just impatient, but Butter&#x27;s Nail Foundation and Hardwear is a much better product and doesn&#x27;t leave me with the dreaded fingerprint smudge/never drying nails.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s Essie, so it lasts at least a week without significant chipping (and touching up the occasional smear or scratch is a breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please couple this with the quick dry essie polish...</li>
            <li>Only filled in the gaps after 3 coats which then left any polish I put on gummy</li>
            <li>Bought this to try since my nails have ridges and sometimes flakes near tips.</li>
            <li>Will not purchase again, but I will use over a better base coat just because the color is nice.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong coat, chipping easily, so not very useful as the only polish.  </li>
            <li>It covers my nails perfectly as the base without making my nails yellow and brittle.</li>
            <li>This formula was a little more watery than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>My fingernails have very deep ridges and make my nails crack off down to the quick.</li>
            <li>Usually when I paint my nails with white polish, it would look all bumpy, but this makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>I just used one coat of this filler and the ridges were still there, but just barely.</li>
            <li>I first got it as a little sample in a set of two Essie reds.</li>

            <li> but i often use 2 coats for a super smooth base</li>
            <li> This only smoothed the very minor ridges.</li>
            <li> Great base coat, or just put on a few coats if you don&#x27;t have time to put on a darker color.</li>
            <li> this works well to provide a smooth base for polish on my very ridged nails.  </li>
            <li> and this helps me keep nail polish on for an extra few days.</li>
            <li> If your nails have gotten into rough shape you should skip this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had lost a toe nail due to an accident.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend, as a smoothing base coat or as that polished, natural look that inevitably earns compliments, get it!!</li>
            <li> My nails are thin naturally as it is</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to keep filling it down to make it smoother.</li>
            <li> One coat fills and smoothes the ridges, providing a smooth base for other polish.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t understand why or how I was developing a little crevice in one of my nails.  </li>
            <li> This little jar helped to coat, cover, protect and eventually contain, and lead to the eventual elimination of said little crevice.  </li>
            <li> I have nails that are weak due to grooves in them.  </li>
            <li> I had it on my wish list after reading a few reviews that were negative and then I went ahead and tried it.</li>
            <li> I do use a lot of Essie polish, but I also use Sally Hanson and other less expensive polishes.  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts at least five days w/out a chip.</li>
            <li> The only thing that made me dissapointed was that the nail polish will still chip if you go inside a chlorinated pool with this base coat.</li>
            <li> So I was a little disappointed that this didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> This base coat is a little costly(including shipping costs,)</li>
            <li> I have very thin, line-textured nails that are so severely ridged, that I cannot wear colored nail polishes without the lines showing through.</li>
            <li> you have yourself a subtle semi-French manicure that somehow makes the base pinker and the tips whiter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a base coat or to &#x27;fill the gaps.&#x27;</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really fill the gaps and ridges as well as I had hoped, but it has a nice semi mat finish that wears well.</li>
            <li> I like the way this brightens my nails under a sheer coat.  I like the matte finish.  It dries fast and makes a good bond with the polish.</li>
            <li> my nails chip ALL OF THE TIME and this helps me keep nail polish on for an extra few days. Def worth the money!</li>
            <li> 2 stars for the color since it looked pretty under a clear top coat, however, my manicure chipped in a day. My pedicures usually last forever no matter what cheap polish i use, but it chipped within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nail psoriasis so I need a product that actually fills ridges and helps hide discoloration.  This only smoothed the very minor ridges. Will not purchase again, but I will use over a better base coat just because the color is nice.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I do my finger and toe nails.  I do not have a lot of ridges, but putting this on the nail makes the nail polish last much longer then usual.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what nail polish you use, either.  Any nail polish will stay on longer if you put this on first.  I do use a lot of Essie polish, but I also use Sally Hanson and other less expensive polishes.  It works with all of them.  I can get up to two weeks of wear with this product.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had lost a toe nail due to an accident. And now that it&#x27;s coming in it has some bumps in it. So I was a little disappointed that this didn&#x27;t do the trick. It&#x27;s a good product for little ridges but not for Deeper ridges.</li>
            <li> First off the shipping was very fast! Secondly, works exactly as described,  and then some! As always with Essie this is a super fast drying product! I absolutely love the Essie nail care brand!</li>
            <li> I have nails that are weak due to grooves in them.  This doesn&#x27;t make them stronger, but it does smooth out the look of the grooves and makes the nails look nicer.  It isn&#x27;t a strong coat, chipping easily, so not very useful as the only polish.  But I also like that it makes a matte finish, so I just take it off when it chips and reapply it.  My nails are too much of a mess to use nail polish on top that would draw attention to them. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with Essie.</li>
            <li> Might be my favorite nail polish ever (although this isn&#x27;t a polish, per se). I have very fair skin and a lot of the lighter pinks make my hands look like they belong to a cadaver. One fast coat of this ridge-filler gives my nails a natural, smooth, even, matte tone. It lasts about three or four days before beginning to wear off.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, line-textured nails that are so severely ridged, that I cannot wear colored nail polishes without the lines showing through. The color is just enough to look natural, but also enough of a nail color change for me that I wouldn&#x27;t want to add another color on top.</li>
            <li> I would say it works ok!  You would need several coats to eliminate all the gaps</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. One coat fills and smoothes the ridges, providing a smooth base for other polish. Two or three coats and you have yourself a subtle semi-French manicure that somehow makes the base pinker and the tips whiter.  Plus, it&#x27;s Essie, so it lasts at least a week without significant chipping (and touching up the occasional smear or scratch is a breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the best purchases I have ever made for my nails, and as I have psoriasis, I always wear nail polish or my bare nails actually hurt, so I go through a LOT of nail polish and have made many poor choices. I would go so far as to say this was my best. HIGHLY recommend, as a smoothing base coat or as that polished, natural look that inevitably earns compliments, get it!!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. I love how smooth my nails feel when I use this. Usually when I paint my nails with white polish, it would look all bumpy, but this makes it smooth.I received this item 3 days after I purchased it. The only thing that made me dissapointed was that the nail polish will still chip if you go inside a chlorinated pool with this base coat. I thought this will work no matter what. On the box, it says to use it prior to applying Essie nail color, but you can use any nail polish brand with this. This base coat is a little costly(including shipping costs,) but I think it works prettywell.</li>
            <li> Pros:fills ridges, hides discoloration, seems to seal the edges of peeling nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: dries as a dull matte surface--not too attractive if worn alone.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try since my nails have ridges and sometimes flakes near tips. My nails are thin naturally as it is and I don&#x27;t want to keep filling it down to make it smoother. This product put a layer on the nail that makes it a smooth surface for the nail polish. After showing my friends a color I just bought I was asked if I got them done or did them myself, of coarse I told them I did them. They comments that they look really smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very ridged nails and they have been peeling a bit at the ends, leaving large dents in my nails. This nearly compltely filled everything in (filled in all ridges perfectly, but the deeper dents caused by peeling was not completely smooth) Nails turned out much better with this than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side is that it does not help my nail polish adhere to my nail.</li>
            <li> Great base coat, or just put on a few coats if you don&#x27;t have time to put on a darker color.</li>
            <li> It covers my nails perfectly as the base without making my nails yellow and brittle.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for...helps provide that smooth finish...Please couple this with the quick dry essie polish... that completes the looks with a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t understand why or how I was developing a little crevice in one of my nails.  Then I thought about the daily abuse my life puts my hands, and thereby, my nails in every way, throughout a day.  This little jar helped to coat, cover, protect and eventually contain, and lead to the eventual elimination of said little crevice.  It may not have been the cure, yet I am sure it was the integral aide in the travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to help with the chipping my nails suffer from my job.  Used it multiple times to try it out.  While it did smoothe my nails over, it effected all the polish I put on top.  Slowest drying time ever and never managed to not smudge it.  I tried it with everything from Cover Girl to Chanel, all to the same results.  Maybe I am just impatient, but Butter&#x27;s Nail Foundation and Hardwear is a much better product and doesn&#x27;t leave me with the dreaded fingerprint smudge/never drying nails.</li>
            <li> If your nails have gotten into rough shape you should skip this product. Go to the drugstore and get one of the Sally Hansen products. I would recommend Essie for their regular pastel polishes, Ballet Slippers being a favorite.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on. Good price also!</li>
            <li> Love this basecoat! My nails look professional and smooth. Also my nails don&#x27;t chip as easily as they do without it. My manicure lasts at least five days w/out a chip.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I had it on my wish list after reading a few reviews that were negative and then I went ahead and tried it. I will say to use it with polish and it works , use it as a stand alone product and not so much.</li>
            <li> I mainly have ridges in my thumb nails. This formula was a little more watery than other brands I have tried. Only filled in the gaps after 3 coats which then left any polish I put on gummy and I would get nicks in my polish until I removed it.</li>
            <li> My fingernails have very deep ridges and make my nails crack off down to the quick. So I rarely have any kind of a decent nail. I just used one coat of this filler and the ridges were still there, but just barely. Since I always use a couple of coats of Hard as Nails, the ridges filled in just fine. This is the first filler I&#x27;ve found that really works. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very ridged nails and have tried all sorts of solutions.  While this product doesn&#x27;t produce perfect nails ---- I don&#x27;t think anything would----it is better than any other produce I have tried.  So, if you have problem nails, it is certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails look terrific. I have &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; particularly on my thumbs. You&#x27;d never know it when using this. Thumbs look smooth as glass after adding my polish and topcoat. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great as your basecoat. Really like using it.</li>
            <li> The ridges are gone and my nails are really strong.  I like all of Essies products and this lived up to the rest of their product line</li>
            <li> this works well to provide a smooth base for polish on my very ridged nails.  the color is nice, too.</li>
            <li> love this basecoat. it sries matte but i often use 2 coats for a super smooth base</li>
            <li> I first got it as a little sample in a set of two Essie reds. I repurchased because this is the only nude color I&#x27;ve ever worn that I like. I don&#x27;t use this as a base coat or to &#x27;fill the gaps.&#x27; I use it as a lovely neutral/natural matte-ish polish, and I love it for that. Unlike every nude polish I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is not streaky (if you have any skill at applying nail polish). If only it lasted longer on me... though nothing really does.</li>
