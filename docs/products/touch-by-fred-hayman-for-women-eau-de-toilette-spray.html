            <li> She sprayed me down that Xmas Day 2014.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is no longer sold in the city we live in unfortunately</li>

            <li> This bottle is literally half the price it was when it was sold in the store!</li>
            <li> It is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> The perfume has very little smell and not the one I always buy.</li>

            <li> I am so disappointed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making it, I will be very unhappy.  </li>
            <li> The scent was horrible!!!</li>
            <li> To make matters worst, it states I cannot get a refund for this type of item.</li>

            <li> Purchased Touch by Fred Hayman based upon reviews that I read online (plus my love of Giorgio Beverly Hills).  I have received TONS of compliments on Touch. It is a lovely floral fragrance with top notes of delicate orange blossom and juicy peach. Middle notes are carnation and violet, followed by powdery base notes of sandalwood and vetiver. Perfect for daytime wear.</li>

            <li> This is my signature fragrance.  If they ever stop making it, I will be very unhappy.  A clean smell.  I&#x27;m always asked what are u wearing?</li>
            <li> I cannot believe #Amazon would sell a fake product.  Out of all the sellers I chose Amazon because I trusted them. When I received the perfume, the top was different than usual and broken.  The scent was horrible!!! To make matters worst, it states I cannot get a refund for this type of item. I am so disappointed with the quality of this product. I feel like I was ripped off!! I don&#x27;t give this not even a 1/2 a star.</li>
            <li> i love it.. soft elegant scent. i recommend it if you are looking for a soft clean scent.. Awesome. hard to find but amazon has it</li>
            <li> I got 2 for xmas for my wife, I have no words to describe this perfume but all I can say its my wife is sooooooooo happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent since I first purchased this product from Fred Hayman at Giorgio&#x27;s on Rodeo Drive.  I get more compliments when I use this particular product because of its subtle fragrance.  It is not overpowering. I treasure every bottle of Touch that I purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a classic favorite of mine. It has a refreshing, light, beautiful and attractive scent. You cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> An old time favorite!</li>
            <li> product is in the fred hayman TOUCH BOTTLE, but right away i noticed the coloring to be to dark.and the smell is not the same,very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Order this yearly for my mother in law.  She loves it and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and I like it</li>
            <li> Stirring the first instinct that hits the,senses. Although shes young at heart, shes comfortable with herself. She wears TOUCH because it makes her feel sexy and she has no problem with being sought out. You won&#x27;t smell it thirty feet away but once you are with her, you will not want anyone thirty feet near her by himself.  She will wear it only with you but she will be sure to get your full attention. Floral, feminine, and seductive. TOUCH by Fred Hayman for Women for a man like you.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for years  I have tried other perfumes but always return to this.  I have been approached by perfect strangers who walk up and ask me what I am wearing.  My husband loves it&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can buy it I will never change again</li>
            <li> Have worn this for 20 years, it is my romantic fragrance. Get lots of, &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; Highly recommend!</li>

When our Grams passed away several years ago - my sister inheirted the perfume and she fell in love. Its one of those scents that works really well with her body chemistry and she gets compliments wherever she goes. Its not overpowering either! It was quite reasonably priced here on Amazon too. I was amazed - how quick it arrived; the packaging was perfect too. It was worth it - I will get it again for my sister for Valentine&#x27;s Day or Mother&#x27;s Day because she is awesome. Its a top-notch buy.</li>

            <li> My wife has purchased this product several times. She absolutely loves it and so does my son. Would purchase again.</li>

            <li> My signature scent, been wearing this for years and always receive compliments!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Touch perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 10 years. I only wear a few different fragrances, and this is one of them. I have never written any reviews for anything that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, on Amazon, but this perfume is so impressive. I am complimented every time I wear it. Everyone asks what scent it is. It&#x27;s a fresh, light scent. Perfect for any occasion. You can occasionally find it in a perfume outlet store, but usually I have to buy it online. Perfume is one of the most marked up things you can buy (400-1700%) This one is so inexpensive and definitely worth a try.</li>

            <li> my mom loves it cause is an old fragrance that she has used for years.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of classy, VERY BEAUTIFUL, sexy woman of 35+ but it also smells like expensive Tide laundry detergent. When I first met my guy friend&#x27;s mother she pulled me aside and told me the steps to seduce a man with this perfume. 1st: Shower! 2nd: Spray some on yourself and sheets. 3rd: He&#x27;s going to get to touching! She sprayed me down that Xmas Day 2014. Less than a month later me and her son were dating. Still are.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter.  She loves this fragrance.</li>

They know when she has entered the room by the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Last year, someone me asked on the airplane what the perfume she was wearing ... It made me smile when he remarked that he wanted to purchase for his wife too.&lt;br /&gt;I love the sweet essence of spice</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this item. Both times there have been issues with the sprayer at the dot where the cologne sprays out.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is no longer sold in the city we live in unfortunately and this is the ONLY  fragrance my mother will wear. This bottle is literally half the price it was when it was sold in the store! As long as nothing changes, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it every 3 or 4 months for my mommy :)</li>
            <li> For two years now I had been looking everywhere for Fred Hayman&#x27;s &amp;#34;Touch&amp;#34; for women, unsuccessfully. I tried Amazon on a hunch, and lo and behold, I found it! Bought two, for good measure...</li>
            <li> Years ago you had to drive to Chicago to buy Touch. No longer sold in stores, and it&#x27;s my MOST favorite perfume EVER!! Was SO excited to see it was on Amazon. This perfume is amazing and you&#x27;ll get more compliments. It came , I put some on that morning, went to an appt. I had . Literally had it on for 15 minutes and a gentleman said&amp;quot; oh my gosh..what&#x27;s that smell....it&#x27;s wonderful!!! And here starts the compliments in 15 minutes!! Thank you Amazon....I love you for having it. !!!! Forever a customer as long as you carry Touch!!!</li>

            <li> I get compliments all the time when wearing Touch by Fred Hayman even from people at stores, work, restaurants that I don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> Bottle was teenie tiny. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Touch by Fred Hayman for Women  has been my favorite fragrance for more than 20 years. Its warm, light scent is different from recent fragrances, and  I often receive questions and compliments about it from men as well as women.  I don &#x27;t feel like &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; without it.</li>
            <li> I love this light flowery scent.  I always receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
