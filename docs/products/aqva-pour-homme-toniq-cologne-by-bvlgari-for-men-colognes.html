            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>the price is great on here for it too.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very popular with my friends and I receive compliments from strangers.</li>
            <li>He loved it, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  </li>
            <li>My nephew was so happy when he opened his gift, this is his favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>I sprayed this on after readng good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Hello Good Days ..</li>
            <li>Great gift for people who likes perfumes with light scent..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Bvlgari Aqva before and it was really nice</li>
            <li>Bottle is unique and the shipping was great.</li>
            <li>Bought a bunch for my young nephews as holiday gifts--they all smell great!</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too :)</li>
            <li>If you want your bf or husband to smell like a men and not a highschool kid buy this he will love it to</li>
            <li>, i wish they can work on it try to give customer more</li>
            <li>Toniq is one of the colognes I enjoy using in the summer because it is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s not the realy Bvlgari Aqva, but it still smells great and the bottle looks the same.</li>
            <li>The transaction was smooth and the cologne price was very good compared to other websites I researched.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>NOt too strong, very soft and sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>do love it thanks.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from lemon and peppermint essential oils that blend with Posidonia sea weed and amber giving it a very fresh, and slightly sweet, scent that will last up to 10 hours.</li>
            <li>Our favorite, above ALL others, is still PS by Paul Sebastian, with Creed&#x27;s Royal Water and Imperial Millesime tying for second.  </li>
            <li>This, so far, has topped the numerous others he&#x27;s tried, very easily giving it our 3rd highest ranking.  </li>
            <li>HIghly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Like all these scents, how the product works with your body chemistry is the most important and that is almost impossible to tell unless you try it somewhere first.</li>
            <li>I like Bvlgari Aqva a lot, so I decided to try the &amp;#34;toniq&amp;#34; version, almost identical to the original aqva but slightly fresher scent, definitely my style.</li>
            <li>Where was this when I was young and single?</li>
            <li>It smells like a combination of freshly mowed grass, a small glass of grapefruit juice, and a whole lot of Bravado.</li>

            <li> Actually the one that i had was not exactly this one (it was another flavor and smell).</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Bvlgari and have become partial to the Aqva.</li>
            <li> My other half loves it and the scent lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what it smell like.</li>
            <li> but this one was unbelievable,</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I could not do it ...&lt;</li>
            <li> wrong product review, my review should be for the Marine Toniq one, although I intend to buy this one as well, so I think I might just have to edit my review then.</li>
            <li> I am very uncomfortable with you, because the product did not come with the presentation to that seen here ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;very ... but very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish I can return it and get the one i had before :(</li>
            <li> smell terrible, i don&#x27;t like it at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells like a combination of freshly mowed grass, a small glass of grapefruit juice, and a whole lot of Bravado.</li>
            <li> Great gift for people who likes perfumes with light scent..</li>
            <li> I was with a friend, a lady I work with, and in the store. I sprayed this on after readng good reviews about it. I asked her what she thought. She said it was \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;. I ordered it here because it was like 1/2 the price. Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve search for desirable scents. The BVLGARI products are too citric for me. I continue to experiment but today&#x27;s women I belief would prefer the scent of C. Dior for man, Dolce &amp; Cabbana the one, or Terre D&#x27;hermes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Bvlgari Aqva before and it was really nice but this one i got online was different from what i had. Actually the one that i had was not exactly this one (it was another flavor and smell). I wish I can return it and get the one i had before :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for a Christmas gift for my nephew.  The transaction was smooth and the cologne price was very good compared to other websites I researched.  My nephew was so happy when he opened his gift, this is his favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> Toniq is one of the colognes I enjoy using in the summer because it is refreshing. Like all these scents, how the product works with your body chemistry is the most important and that is almost impossible to tell unless you try it somewhere first.</li>

            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my cuz&#x27;n.  He loved it, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  Not really sure what it smell like.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and I love the scent!! NOt too strong, very soft and sexy scent.  HIghly recommend it. My husband likes it too :)</li>
            <li> Hello Good Days .. I am very uncomfortable with you, because the product did not come with the presentation to that seen here .. no box .. get scratched and battered because did not fulfill my expectations .. buy it for a gift of the day parents and unfortunately I could not do it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want it back .. because I did not like .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very ... but very uncomfortable</li>
