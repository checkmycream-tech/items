            <li>This deodorant is great for me</li>
            <li>The deodorant factor isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even great on those &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sweaty areas, ladies.</li>
            <li>Does a great job too.  </li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>The result: you smell good for a day or so, but you have to reapply the stuff every day or you&#x27;ll start to stink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can not be more happy.</li>
            <li>Tried &amp;#34;Vichy&amp;#34; from France and amazing as the reviews claim.</li>
            <li>This product works and does not stain or bleach or ruin my nice clothes.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazingly effective and lasts for days.</li>
            <li>This product works for a week or more at a time and is a healthy alternative to antiperspirants!  </li>
            <li>My two girls love this product also.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t smell most days.</li>
            <li>Another member of my family actually uses this product; but swears by it; says it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>you still perspire which is a healthy thing.</li>
            <li>Works great for my husband because he doesn&#x27;t really sweat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about 15 or more years.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Just rub some on after a shower, and there you are -- BO-free and confident.</li>
            <li>Like the healthy idea.</li>
            <li>keep me healthy</li>
            <li>I ordered more.........</li>
            <li>It is a good deodorant, and I can use it only once a week and get good results.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the BEST deodorant out there!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a chemical free deodorant and wanted to try this.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s aluminum free</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>He can go two full days between applications.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and find it a great help for my extremely active lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well on very warm and active days, but I know when I am testing the limits of the product.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see Lavilin still exists and available on amazon (I used to have to order it by mail through ads in the back of funky vegetarian magazines).  </li>
            <li>Your mileage may differ but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>One thing though, when it stops working you&#x27;ll notice your B.O. right away so one must be diligent in its use.</li>
            <li>Nothing will work so good like this little wonder in a jar.</li>
            <li>You also end up getting more of the cream stuck in the armpit hair than on the actual skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure and follow the directions when starting use.</li>
            <li>Something I traced back to the aluminum carbohydrate that many antiperspirants used at the time to help control wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife picked up the first box in a health food store.</li>
            <li>but I wish it would last for more than the workday.</li>
            <li>I can live with that, and my white t-shirts look as good as new.</li>
            <li>Regular deodorants and antiperspirants only cover up the bacteria with good smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>It really works, if you don&#x27;t shave under your arms..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>During the summer I have to apply daily but during the winter I can apply every other day or sometimes every three days which is a big deal for me because I perspire a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is new to me and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>so this is always one of my staples and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Back then, at certain times of the month no matter how much I showered or applied deodorant, by end of day I did no like my odor!.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wake up fresh in the morning, tho, and it&#x27;ll last thru whatever you encounter.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that it last so long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some people can go 2 days without reapplying, but in the summertime I have to reapply everyday.</li>
            <li>The old black jar was better and stronger, but this is still one of the few deodorants that lasts 3-5 days - a feature I love.</li>
            <li>New users need to pay careful attention to the instructions, the method of application is tricky, but once mastered it becomes easy and natural.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a pain to put on at first, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this deodorant really works and expecially for someone over 50 years that all of a sudden experiences a change is perspiration.  </li>
            <li>but would prefer completely unscented.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals, no flowery scent.</li>
            <li>I discovered this when I was in my twenties and was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I love that I only need to apply it a few times a month.  </li>
            <li>Living in such a hot climate for such a long time really put a strain on these products - they tended to work, but they also caused a buildup of gunk in the armpits of my white t-shirts.</li>
            <li>but similar issue developed when I hit menopause!</li>
            <li>At the time I was using the old standard aerosol and stick deodorants like Schick, Mennen, etc.</li>
            <li>I shower, dry very well and apply, but for me it only works for about 12 hours</li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way to staying dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>The cream works OK although not nealry up to the length advertised by the company (7 days, really?), at least for an active man.  </li>

            <li> This product keeps me dry up to seven days.</li>
            <li> Wish we could buy locally for less...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t have wasted my money on regular deodorant products if I&#x27;d know about this.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it was less messy to apply but it does the job so 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I could go every other day between applications, max.  </li>
            <li> The change in air pressure collapsed it down to practically nothing.</li>

            <li> Have been using Lavilin for years and tend to sweat heavily</li>
            <li> Besides, would you rather take a few minutes putting it on, or stink come midday?</li>
            <li> I live in the country, so that includes cutting trees, hoeing crops, etc.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Must be something to do with my ph or body chemistry, not sure, but I stink even after reapplication.  </li>
            <li> Small amount of it goes for week of work</li>
            <li> I read that body odor is a common side effect of menopause.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit less expensive</li>
            <li> The little jar is expensive, but lasts me probably 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive to waste like that.</li>
            <li> but it does--at least for my body chemistry!</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and nearly impossible for a man to apply; it takes A LOT of spreading with the little stick.  </li>
            <li> Was ineffective and the tacky texture made it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> No aluminum&lt;br /&gt;or bad stuff.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was ineffective and the tacky texture made it difficult to apply. It didn&#x27;t hold up to its claim for me by the end of day. Tried &amp;#34;Vichy&amp;#34; from France and amazing as the reviews claim.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me dry up to seven days. My two girls love this product also. I only put on after seven to ten days later.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great for me and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. I have issues with perspiration and I used to use prescription strength deodorants but I was a gentler alternative without harsh chemicals so I switched to Lavilin. During the summer I have to apply daily but during the winter I can apply every other day or sometimes every three days which is a big deal for me because I perspire a great deal. I only wish that it was less messy to apply but it does the job so 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free deodorant and wanted to try this. It was an adjustment since it is a cream, but I am used to it now. I still have to put it on every day, even after 4 weeks if using the product. It works well and I don&#x27;t smell most days. It doesn&#x27;t work as well on very warm and active days, but I know when I am testing the limits of the product. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me as well as others have said.  The deodorant factor isn&#x27;t so great but directions say it may take a few days.  I do have to reapply everyday.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant around; have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Just a little goes a long way to staying dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> The cream works OK although not nealry up to the length advertised by the company (7 days, really?), at least for an active man.  I could go every other day between applications, max.  The cream is very thick and nearly impossible for a man to apply; it takes A LOT of spreading with the little stick.  You also end up getting more of the cream stuck in the armpit hair than on the actual skin.  Just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Has worked for me my entire life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and its earlier formulation for about the last 15 years.  It is a good deodorant, and I can use it only once a week and get good results.  It&#x27;s a bit &#x27;goopy&#x27;, and you have to wash your hands after dabbing it on.  You&#x27;ll wake up fresh in the morning, tho, and it&#x27;ll last thru whatever you encounter.  I live in the country, so that includes cutting trees, hoeing crops, etc.</li>
            <li> This product works for a week or more at a time and is a healthy alternative to antiperspirants!  Make sure and follow the directions when starting use.</li>
            <li> Another member of my family actually uses this product; but swears by it; says it works wonderfully. He uses this cream about once every 4 days and never has a problem with odor or perspiration.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. However, I made the mistake of bringing a jar on an airline flight. The change in air pressure collapsed it down to practically nothing. FYI. Too expensive to waste like that.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful deodorant. Wish it was a bit less expensive but I have to say this deodorant really works and expecially for someone over 50 years that all of a sudden experiences a change is perspiration.  This product works and does not stain or bleach or ruin my nice clothes.  Wish we could buy locally for less...</li>
            <li> Good product, but it&#x27;s a small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using this for 3 years &amp; now my son &amp; daughter in law use it. I apply it once every 7 to 10 days. One thing though, when it stops working you&#x27;ll notice your B.O. right away so one must be diligent in its use. Some people can go 2 or 3 weeks beteen applications. While using it,  you still perspire which is a healthy thing. It&#x27;s even great on those &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sweaty areas, ladies.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and find it a great help for my extremely active lifestyle. Travels well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written about Lavilin deodorant before. I&#x27;ve been using it for over fifteen years now. It all started when I was working in the Middle East. At the time I was using the old standard aerosol and stick deodorants like Schick, Mennen, etc. Living in such a hot climate for such a long time really put a strain on these products - they tended to work, but they also caused a buildup of gunk in the armpits of my white t-shirts. Something I traced back to the aluminum carbohydrate that many antiperspirants used at the time to help control wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Lavillin. My wife picked up the first box in a health food store. It works on the principle that it&#x27;s the bacteria that grow in the hair follicles of the arm pit that cause the smell we all refer to as body odor. Kill the bacteria and you stop the smell - any wetness is only water without odor. Regular deodorants and antiperspirants only cover up the bacteria with good smelling stuff. The result: you smell good for a day or so, but you have to reapply the stuff every day or you&#x27;ll start to stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Lavilin ONCE every 7-8 days. That&#x27;s it. No body odor (ever), and some infrequent wetness in the armpits (it&#x27;s only water). I can live with that, and my white t-shirts look as good as new.</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband because he doesn&#x27;t really sweat.  He can go two full days between applications.  I shower, dry very well and apply, but for me it only works for about 12 hours and then it&#x27;s done.  Must be something to do with my ph or body chemistry, not sure, but I stink even after reapplication.  I like it because it&#x27;s aluminum free but I wish it would last for more than the workday.</li>
            <li> The old black jar was better and stronger, but this is still one of the few deodorants that lasts 3-5 days - a feature I love. It is also compact and long lasting. I&#x27;ve used since the seventies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about 15 or more years.  It kills the bacteria that causes underarm odor.  I only use it about once every 5 to 8 days.  Then I don&#x27;t need it again for a while.  The little jar is expensive, but lasts me probably 2 years.  No aluminum in it (Alzheimer&#x27;s risk with deodorants with aluminum).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and years...No aluminum&lt;br /&gt;or bad stuff.  Does a great job too.  Might seem expensive&lt;br /&gt;but it lasts a loooooong time.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant.  I use it every 4th day and it works well.  Light fragrance.  Smells okay but would prefer completely unscented.  Not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Ones I discovered this deodorant during my travel to Arizona and I can not replace it with anything. Nothing will work so good like this little wonder in a jar. Small amount of it goes for week of work and I can not be more happy. I. C</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazingly effective and lasts for days. No harsh chemicals, no flowery scent. No scent at all. And you won&#x27;t smell either! Just rub some on after a shower, and there you are -- BO-free and confident. No foolin&#x27;! Have been using Lavilin for years and tend to sweat heavily so this is always one of my staples and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using lavilin for 37 years.  I love that I only need to apply it a few times a month.  New users need to pay careful attention to the instructions, the method of application is tricky, but once mastered it becomes easy and natural.</li>
            <li> not working for me at all.</li>
            <li> Did not &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; for me.  Like the healthy idea.</li>
            <li> have been using this for years. love the fact that it last so long.  l week for me.  keep me healthy</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I was in my twenties and was surprised how well it worked. Back then, at certain times of the month no matter how much I showered or applied deodorant, by end of day I did no like my odor!. Gradually that problem went away as I matured...but similar issue developed when I hit menopause! I read that body odor is a common side effect of menopause.  I was pleased to see Lavilin still exists and available on amazon (I used to have to order it by mail through ads in the back of funky vegetarian magazines).  It still works great!  I only need to apply it every week or two and wear it overnight. I have no idea how it works (I looked up the ingredients once but nothing stood out) but it does--at least for my body chemistry!</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful!!!!  It lasted five days!!!!  Incredible!!!!  Your mileage may differ but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  I ordered more.........can&#x27;t live&lt;br /&gt;without it now.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST deodorant out there! I have used just about every deodorant there is, and this works the best, for the longest. It is a deodorant not an antiperspirant, but if you need help with odor, this stuff is it! It is a bit of a pain to put on at first, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Besides, would you rather take a few minutes putting it on, or stink come midday? I&#x27;m sure some people can go 2 days without reapplying, but in the summertime I have to reapply everyday. Although I&#x27;m an oddball; I&#x27;ve had embarrassing sweating problems since puberty and nothing seemed to work- even the so-called &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; deodorants out there. Wish I would&#x27;ve found this stuff 25 years ago...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15 years &amp; will never change!  1 jar lasts me 1yr. Saving a lot of $$$ &amp; toxic chemicals like aluminum lake, just to mention 1 reason to throw away your aresoel!!!</li>
            <li> This is new to me and I really do like it. Won&#x27;t have wasted my money on regular deodorant products if I&#x27;d know about this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this! It really works, if you don&#x27;t shave under your arms..</li>
