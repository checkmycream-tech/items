            <li>I was very pleased with the product when it got here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>These trimmers are amazing for detail and edge work.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and have always used a wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 start vs 5 is it would be nice if it came with a case for storage.</li>
            <li>specifically, it kind of fell into my lap</li>
            <li>I was kind of \\&quot;upset\\&quot; or rather,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for side-burns, it&#x27;s great for evening off either side of where my mustache connects to my goatee, so they are vertically straight and even.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know the reason for this, as again</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know, so please don&#x27;t take anything I just listed as things that it either does or does not do...</li>
            <li>If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\</li>
            <li>If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\</li>
            <li>Perfect companion to my Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his trimmer and uses it to keep his side burns and neck hair trimmed nice and tidy between haircuts.</li>
            <li>Nice one Oster.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>We were very happy to find a new one and realize it is just as wonderful as the first one.  </li>
            <li>Now is the time for a new one :D</li>
            <li>Very easy to line up my clients.</li>
            <li>Perfect for haircuting, could not ask for a better set of finishers, I would highly recommend these to anyone who cuts hair</li>
            <li>These are by far the best trimmers I have owned.</li>
            <li>But if you are a consumer looking for something to shave your face with, this T-Finisher isn&#x27;t suitable.  </li>
            <li>Overall great results and great buy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use effective trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good simple product, does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>and I love the t-finishers</li>
            <li>These are the best trimmers I&#x27;ve used, I like the blade on them and love how quiet they are.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>totally love my trimmers they are durable and work wonders..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist I use it for a living. :-)</li>
            <li>not something off of a Wizard, etc. &#x3D;])  </li>
            <li>hence the name/model of \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>Once I was able to use it as it was intended, or rather, as I intended, as a replacement for my pieces of junk, etc.</li>
            <li>Well, I never did that again &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these before for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t rely on batteries which always degrade over time.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper and trimmers work great</li>
            <li>and I have had many over the years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>You would think that it would be in the league of andis outliner, wahl detailer, or the styliners, but this more of a consumer product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I thought all Oster clippers were top of the line.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love them and at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I really love this electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>works, is slient, much better than the crappy wahls brand...</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Nice clean lines.</li>
            <li>Very clean cut, basically what they use at the salon.</li>
            <li>Best grooming tool I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product because it is an Oster, but it does not trim good at all, my other treamer which is a \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; treams much better than that.</li>
            <li>This is very sweet.</li>
            <li>I love these there quit and smooth.</li>
            <li>must* have 12 or more pairs of cheap scissors, combs, smocks, etc.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of trimming the hair off this old guy&#x27;s ears too.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the Norelco trimmer, but I figured that I would be even happier with a professional product, so I got this T-Finisher.  </li>
            <li>I thought the old one was great, this one #1.</li>
            <li>Build quality is great, and it just feels like a professional gadget when you hold it in your hand.</li>
            <li>My wife does much of my edging and has said she thinks it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>its a very good trimmer light weight quiet and easy to handle.    </li>
            <li>There is almost no fatigue from the vibration as it is very mild and almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>The hair also feeds into the blade easily, so shaping isn&#x27;t a challenge.</li>
            <li>The blades are supper sharpe making it so easy to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>Seller was very quick to deliver product, It came&lt;br /&gt;packaged</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Anther perch is that my wife can easily use it as well for her bikini cuts etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really strong motor, and totally safe to use on the special places.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer hands down.</li>
            <li>Works amazing glad I made the purchase highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, my head got shaved,</li>
            <li>**worked fine, my head got shaved, etc.  </li>
            <li>They are perfectly fine</li>
            <li>They might have worked fine, but i returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li>Everything arrived fine and timely.</li>
            <li>If you do this, it cuts close, quick, and safe.  </li>
            <li>I adjusted the blade (5 minutes) and it now cuts smooth and painlessly   leaving my neck as smooth as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item, ONLY if you adjust it as soon as you get it!!!</li>
            <li>but, then I plugged it in and noticed how smooth it was, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...</li>
            <li>However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  </li>
            <li>However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  </li>
            <li>They make perfect edges and are not too heavy.</li>
            <li>On/off switch is smooth.</li>
            <li>bye cheap Wahl trimmers I had to replace every five years.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  </li>
            <li>the motor is very powerful and can handle the toughest hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and the product trims so neat and clean.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who like a nice and clean trim line.</li>
            <li>First of all, as with most clippers you have to adjust the blade to make it shape your hairline,</li>
            <li>I became even more interested in purchasing it as an add-on to whichever Clipper</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t originally looking for the T-Finisher</li>
            <li>Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really clean the way I was expecting</li>
            <li>beard, mustache clean and close.</li>
            <li>And it keeps my boys looking clean cut.</li>
            <li>I use it every week to keep clean look.</li>
            <li>: the instructions really don&#x27;t talk about the most important topic: how do you use the trimmer?  </li>
            <li>if you need to go from your chin to your side-burns, this will do it in 3 \\&quot;swipes\\&quot; of the blade, and if you make sure to overlap a bit, so you stay with the original line made on the first swipe/cut made by the T-Finisher, it&#x27;ll made a completely straight edge all the way with no problems and no guide at all &#x3D;]  </li>

            <li>Or, for \\&quot;clearing\\&quot; a large amount of surface area at once &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>, I decided I&#x27;d invest in a *nice*, professional pair of *MAGNETIC* Hair Clippers (I purchased the Wahl Senior in all Chrome (8505 or something)</li>
            <li>(I shave my head with no clip every Friday), then I might as well also invest the money and get a nice, professional trimmer for my mustache and goatee/beard</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not at all good for shaving your face -- and for obvious reasons that I wish I had thought of before I got it.  </li>
            <li>Good quiet motor</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the last good thing I can say about the Wahl now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, the blade(s) are extremely wide, which is great for making long (width wise) even lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  </li>
            <li>the more you use them the better they cut.....would definitely recommend buying them.</li>
            <li>Truly a super trimmer.</li>
            <li>I like Oster finisher, sturdy, precise, very easy to maintain, works for years (if you clean it properly and oil it).</li>
            <li>I think I may have received a refurbish product because a new treamer no matter what brand would work better than this one.</li>
            <li>It gets really close and is easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li>May be good for fine hair salons, but not for line ups and sharp crisp shapeups.</li>
            <li>and wow, my beard has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and stop wasting your money on those cheap big box stores all in one clippers when this does what you need better.</li>
            <li>and I liked it well enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li>The cost of trimmer was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and worth the money and does a neat job.</li>
            <li>The motor is so powerful it trips the gfi outlet in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, if you want to use these clippers for super fine beard detailing, you should purchase an optional fine blade which you can switch out with the standard one.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that right out of the box.</li>
            <li>This cuts much closer and clean.</li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, easy to handle, durable and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I own both the Fast Feeds and 76&#x27;s, recently added this trimmer to my collection.  </li>
            <li>You should only press very lightly against the skin.</li>
            <li>However, the T-shaped end is very wide and good for straight lines.</li>
            <li>It came sooner than expected and was Brand New, a great compliment to the classic 76 clippers that I use.</li>
            <li>The first week after I used it, two women noticed and complimented me.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts very close and is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>My most recent purchase of the Oster Ac T-finisher quit working after one use.  </li>
            <li>I used these trimmers the first day after adjusting the blade</li>
            <li>When I first received it...</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed however, and I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, I just shave my head every week and have a goatee/mustache and need to keep those trimmed as well as my sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>, I had been recommended (by Amazon) and looked at/into the Oster T-Finisher Trimmer, not realizing at first that it was strictly a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; type of thing...  </li>
            <li>I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name</li>
            <li>Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  </li>
            <li>I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing them from amazon</li>
            <li>It does not provide a close or consistent shave.</li>
            <li>i used this for the first time yesterday after adjusting the blade to be a zero.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this one precisely because almost every professional barber shop that i have been t over the years seems to have this model.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and I am in the military.  </li>
            <li>I should have done that the first time.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a ton of videos on YouTube which show you how to do this, but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not difficult and should be adjusted before using anyway.</li>
            <li>In fact, you should inspect your clippers regularly to make sure that they haven&#x27;t gone out of alignment.</li>
            <li>Not my first and not my last thats for sure.  </li>
            <li>Oster is slightly larger and heavier, giving you more trimmer for your money in every way.  </li>
            <li>The signature tags fell off the first day I used them.</li>
            <li>Whereas I can quickly zip the Norelco trimmer around my face, this trimmer is harder to maneuver, and shaving with it is slower and more</li>
            <li>If you want your haircut to come out professional looking with clean edge detailing, this is what you need.</li>
            <li>This is a *PROFESSIONAL* shaver/clipper and therefore, as with most *PROFESSIONAL* level products, comes barebones;  you add the accessories that you want to add (if any)</li>
            <li>their and made me repeat the process at least once more, if not 2 or 3 times to make sure that it got everything...</li>
            <li>their and made me repeat the process at least once more, if not 2 or 3 times to make sure that it got everything...</li>
            <li>Note: the 76 does as good a job as the trimmer but is noisier, runs hotter and is more difficult because of its size to use on your self.</li>
            <li>I do wish the actual trimmer was a smaller plate width wise</li>
            <li>But, since it does run at such a low RPM, it&#x27;s a very nice break from the loudness of most other \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; and it does reduce irritation</li>

            <li>I got to outline three people before Christmas and was so excited because of how well they performed that I could hardly wait to do my own cut.</li>
            <li>fast shipping exactly as described</li>
            <li>love the cover , shipped promptly even with the long wait</li>
            <li>VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide...</li>
            <li>VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide...</li>
            <li>I have used the same Oster T-trimmer clipper (although mine is labeled (deluxe styler) for 40+ years and it just developed a cracked case in need of repair - it is  a great, professional tool; I am even able to order a new case for it - obviously this is  a tool made to used over a long time and repaired (not replaced): built to last!</li>
            <li>(I only had a certain amount of facial hair that needed shaving at the moment, etc &#x3D;]), and absolutely loved it, but, couldn&#x27;t really give it a proper test until I had to do a \\&quot;full service\\&quot; on my facial hair</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to handle and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep them clean and properly oiled and these should last years</li>
            <li>The cut was not a sharp, clean or close at all, it hurts against my skin, etc.</li>
            <li>This clipper works well and cuts very low, great for heavy use</li>
            <li>im a stylest at a fast paced salon and do hundreds of haircuts a month</li>
            <li>Like mowing a lawn with a wide mower &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>However, because of the wide blade, I can&#x27;t use it for so many things I was planning on using it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then you really can&#x27;t beat this Oster \\&quot;T-Finisher.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>

            <li>These are paired with my Oster Fast Feed just a lil while longer</li>
            <li>Really, any close than this</li>
            <li>This trimmer makes trimming around the ears much easier.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and on time..</li>
            <li>Was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I bought it for shaping and edging my beard and it does this very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.close shave.</li>
            <li>These clippers gives a really close cut.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of alternatives for clipping the paw pad hair and around the ears of our 8 year old Golden Retriever.</li>
            <li>Grooming the dog is now much easier</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth operation, quiet operation, didn&#x27;t over heat.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting to much.</li>
            <li>this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li>It has all and more what is expected.  </li>
            <li>But the most unexpected feature was how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>just loosen the two bolts on top , take out the blade and loosen the other two bolts and move the blade up to be flush with a table or something</li>
            <li>They also cut better than an other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The T head makes it easy to cut very selectively -- just a single hair, if that is what you want.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, and very much  worth the small price difference.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the Oster cuts fast and close in just one pass, though it&#x27;s a little hard to be sure that the Wahl didn&#x27;t compare when it was new</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t moving super fast or anything, just standard head-shaving speed, but I wasn&#x27;t inching along</li>

            <li>The Oster T-Trimmer is a very handy device for cutting beard growth, trimming moustaches, and the unit itself is quiet and very light in weight ..</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s a smooth hum, not a loud buzz.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the shaver as a whole, please don&#x27;t get me wrong &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>I usually love and trust Oster products, but this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>really do like the new one.</li>
            <li>This is a classic T-finisher.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t make the mistake of purchasing this pair of finishing clippers for an overall facial hair trimmer, then I think you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied with the product</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ll have the Classic 76 to finish my set.</li>
            <li>overall i am very satisfied and several of my coworkers have already ordered the same model.  </li>
            <li>They just dont make any products as high of quality as this anymore.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Oster trimmer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The T Finisher is high quality</li>
            <li>as each kit I purchased came with one of each &#x3D;]), like scissors, clips/guides, combs, little things of oil, smocks/aprons to avoid getting hair on the person receiving a hair cut/shave, etc.</li>
            <li>(however, it was a little more than I was looking to spend at *that</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li>, I just have a normal mustache and goatee...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been procrastinating for a long time to purchase these, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>The cord is nicely long, but as with the Fast Feed trimmer, is kind of stiff and wants to retain the kinks when rolled.  </li>
            <li>I had a wahl peanut and this trims much closer and does not mess up my skin   like a blade would.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one because that one had no power, didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>It defeated the purpose of having new trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I went looking and found this new trimmer on line.</li>
            <li>These are my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; brand for trimmers and clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cost almost as much as a new trimmer to replace the battery</li>
            <li>so I bought the new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, Looks like I&#x27;ll be hoping for UPS to deliver the new one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>the trimmer really wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be(leaving traces of hair behind.)  </li>
            <li>and I figured that I&#x27;d get it later if these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers really did make that much of a difference, etc.)  </li>
            <li>that instead of trimming my mustache above my lip (so the hard stops at the top of my lip) easily, making a nice, straight line, I&#x27;d have to move the shaver itself all over the place just to get it to \\&quot;hook up\\&quot; and start cutting the hairs, as going straight on, it wouldn&#x27;t do anything; as if the amount of bristles/hair overwhelmed it...  </li>
            <li>Very professional finish.  </li>
            <li>These feed very fast and are very quiet.</li>
            <li>However, because of that width, I&#x27;m unable to shave most of the parts of my facial hair that I wanted to use it for because I can&#x27;t get it in the spot/space to shave it &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my barber his was looking old!</li>
            <li>Funny thing, when I received it&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be the same trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a very sharp and precise clipper to use when in-between the barber.  </li>
            <li>I quickly came to the realization that, unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to get rid of my existing pieces of junk just yet &#x3D;</li>
            <li>*, because I quickly found out that, due to the Lower RPM, it didn&#x27;t cut *everything* in it&#x27;s path when I moved it at the speed that I usually move my Wahl Senior Hair Clippers at when shaving my head w/ no clip...  Instead, it did cut a swatch/line out pretty good, it just left about 5% or less of the hair still</li>

            <li>I have been looking for a trimmer to replace my old clippers.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well, but not especially close.</li>
            <li>have had no trouble and havent had to replace the blade yet</li>
            <li>Professionally built.  </li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist and appreciate how quite these are as well as my clients.</li>
            <li>It was a old trimmer, but still was working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even shave a 2 day old beard without it sticking.</li>
            <li>Ordered it as a replacement for old one that blade got rust (my fault).</li>
            <li>Trimmer was looks old and used.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a professional trimmer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;For a professional.</li>
            <li>Old pair are used to shave dogs foot pads.  </li>
            <li>The motor completely gave out.</li>
            <li>&quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc...</li>
            <li>&quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc...</li>
            <li>Well, if you just look at it, there&#x27;s a flat, slanted top plate that doesn&#x27;t move, that has a little metal comb on it.  </li>
            <li>but I was expecting something with quality similar to the Classic 76 trimmer..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality and very quiet.</li>
            <li>Overall, keep the blades clean and lubed and these clippers will last a long time.</li>
            <li>You need to hold the trimmer so that the slanted comb part is almost flat against your skin, at a slight angle so only the comb is touching your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the hair that grows under my bottom lip, to the left and right of the patch of hair that connects my bottom lip to my goatee in the center, when it grows, I shave it off, so there is a nice \\&quot;wide line\\&quot; (or patch) of hair down the middle under my lips...  </li>
            <li>They started out ok, but after about 8 or 9 months of using them may be once a week, the drive became noticeably weak.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;ve ever tried, there are no other kinds at Target, etc...</li>
            <li>Not sharp and</li>
            <li>But, to make sure my mustache stops at my upper lip, with the contours of my upper lip, the blade is too wide to use on either side, as I need something like, 1/2\\&quot; or 3/4\\&quot; wide instead..  </li>
            <li>The new packaging is a red color not grey.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair since high school</li>
            <li>Recommended by a professional hair stylist and built to last.</li>
            <li>So far, that is the only thing I could come up with that could be a con.  </li>
            <li>At roughly the same time, while comparing the two clippers I was interested in (the Wahl Senior &amp; the Oster *76)</li>
            <li>one\\&quot; solutions that came with a nice (fake) leather bag, etc.</li>
            <li>If your looking for one for home use this should be OKAY but not great</li>
            <li>it probably wasn&#x27;t even a whole 5% that it left behind, it was more like, a *lot* of little hairs that either didn&#x27;t get cut or didn&#x27;t get cut all of the way, and they were still sticking up; so it wasn&#x27;t a complete shave (for each line it did) - to do that, and get the results that I expect when shaving my head w/o a clip using my professional HAIR CLIPPERS from Wahl, not a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;finisher\\&quot;, I had to move the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\</li>

            <li>The thing is very simple to use, you don&#x27;t need any add-on combs or anything, and really gives your beard sharp definition for that professional look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people say the trimmers are not at all sharp and they don&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>cuts real close after I zero gapped it, (Just take off the screws then loosen the ones on the blade, and carefully line it up, not too close but close enough)</li>
            <li>I usually just do a quick \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s taken care of on either side with my piece of junk facial clippers w/o a clip...</li>
            <li>quiet operation, sharp blades that trim very close, and</li>
            <li>They are very quiet, but they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li>Be careful in the sensitive areas!  </li>
            <li>(it certainly didn&#x27;t cut as well after a few years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; very slow and basically give it time to cut everything, as the blades didn&#x27;t move fast enough (I think) to cut that much hair in that \\&quot;short\\&quot; of a time period</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> These trimmers are amazing for detail and edge work.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and have always used a wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 start vs 5 is it would be nice if it came with a case for storage.</li>
            <li> specifically, it kind of fell into my lap</li>
            <li> I was kind of \\&quot;upset\\&quot; or rather,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for side-burns, it&#x27;s great for evening off either side of where my mustache connects to my goatee, so they are vertically straight and even.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know the reason for this, as again</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know, so please don&#x27;t take anything I just listed as things that it either does or does not do...</li>
            <li> If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\</li>
            <li> If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\</li>
            <li> Perfect companion to my Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his trimmer and uses it to keep his side burns and neck hair trimmed nice and tidy between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Nice one Oster.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> We were very happy to find a new one and realize it is just as wonderful as the first one.  </li>
            <li> Now is the time for a new one :D</li>
            <li> Very easy to line up my clients.</li>
            <li> Perfect for haircuting, could not ask for a better set of finishers, I would highly recommend these to anyone who cuts hair</li>
            <li> These are by far the best trimmers I have owned.</li>
            <li> But if you are a consumer looking for something to shave your face with, this T-Finisher isn&#x27;t suitable.  </li>
            <li> Overall great results and great buy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good simple product, does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> and I love the t-finishers</li>
            <li> These are the best trimmers I&#x27;ve used, I like the blade on them and love how quiet they are.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> totally love my trimmers they are durable and work wonders..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist I use it for a living. :-)</li>
            <li> not something off of a Wizard, etc. &#x3D;])  </li>
            <li> hence the name/model of \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> Once I was able to use it as it was intended, or rather, as I intended, as a replacement for my pieces of junk, etc.</li>
            <li> Well, I never did that again &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these before for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t rely on batteries which always degrade over time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and trimmers work great</li>
            <li> and I have had many over the years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> You would think that it would be in the league of andis outliner, wahl detailer, or the styliners, but this more of a consumer product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought all Oster clippers were top of the line.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love them and at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I really love this electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li> works, is slient, much better than the crappy wahls brand...</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Nice clean lines.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut, basically what they use at the salon.</li>
            <li> Best grooming tool I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product because it is an Oster, but it does not trim good at all, my other treamer which is a \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; treams much better than that.</li>
            <li> This is very sweet.</li>
            <li> I love these there quit and smooth.</li>
            <li> must* have 12 or more pairs of cheap scissors, combs, smocks, etc.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of trimming the hair off this old guy&#x27;s ears too.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with the Norelco trimmer, but I figured that I would be even happier with a professional product, so I got this T-Finisher.  </li>
            <li> I thought the old one was great, this one #1.</li>
            <li> Build quality is great, and it just feels like a professional gadget when you hold it in your hand.</li>
            <li> My wife does much of my edging and has said she thinks it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> its a very good trimmer light weight quiet and easy to handle.    </li>
            <li> There is almost no fatigue from the vibration as it is very mild and almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> The hair also feeds into the blade easily, so shaping isn&#x27;t a challenge.</li>
            <li> The blades are supper sharpe making it so easy to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Seller was very quick to deliver product, It came&lt;br /&gt;packaged</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Anther perch is that my wife can easily use it as well for her bikini cuts etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really strong motor, and totally safe to use on the special places.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer hands down.</li>
            <li> Works amazing glad I made the purchase highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, my head got shaved,</li>
            <li> **worked fine, my head got shaved, etc.  </li>
            <li> They are perfectly fine</li>
            <li> They might have worked fine, but i returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived fine and timely.</li>
            <li> If you do this, it cuts close, quick, and safe.  </li>
            <li> I adjusted the blade (5 minutes) and it now cuts smooth and painlessly   leaving my neck as smooth as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item, ONLY if you adjust it as soon as you get it!!!</li>
            <li> but, then I plugged it in and noticed how smooth it was, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...</li>
            <li> However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  </li>
            <li> However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  </li>
            <li> They make perfect edges and are not too heavy.</li>
            <li> On/off switch is smooth.</li>
            <li> bye cheap Wahl trimmers I had to replace every five years.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  </li>
            <li> the motor is very powerful and can handle the toughest hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and the product trims so neat and clean.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who like a nice and clean trim line.</li>
            <li> First of all, as with most clippers you have to adjust the blade to make it shape your hairline,</li>
            <li> I became even more interested in purchasing it as an add-on to whichever Clipper</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t originally looking for the T-Finisher</li>
            <li> Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really clean the way I was expecting</li>
            <li> beard, mustache clean and close.</li>
            <li> And it keeps my boys looking clean cut.</li>
            <li> I use it every week to keep clean look.</li>
            <li> : the instructions really don&#x27;t talk about the most important topic: how do you use the trimmer?  </li>
            <li> if you need to go from your chin to your side-burns, this will do it in 3 \\&quot;swipes\\&quot; of the blade, and if you make sure to overlap a bit, so you stay with the original line made on the first swipe/cut made by the T-Finisher, it&#x27;ll made a completely straight edge all the way with no problems and no guide at all &#x3D;]  </li>

            <li> Or, for \\&quot;clearing\\&quot; a large amount of surface area at once &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> , I decided I&#x27;d invest in a *nice*, professional pair of *MAGNETIC* Hair Clippers (I purchased the Wahl Senior in all Chrome (8505 or something)</li>
            <li> (I shave my head with no clip every Friday), then I might as well also invest the money and get a nice, professional trimmer for my mustache and goatee/beard</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not at all good for shaving your face -- and for obvious reasons that I wish I had thought of before I got it.  </li>
            <li> Good quiet motor</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the last good thing I can say about the Wahl now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, the blade(s) are extremely wide, which is great for making long (width wise) even lines, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  </li>
            <li> the more you use them the better they cut.....would definitely recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> Truly a super trimmer.</li>
            <li> I like Oster finisher, sturdy, precise, very easy to maintain, works for years (if you clean it properly and oil it).</li>
            <li> I think I may have received a refurbish product because a new treamer no matter what brand would work better than this one.</li>
            <li> It gets really close and is easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li> May be good for fine hair salons, but not for line ups and sharp crisp shapeups.</li>
            <li> and wow, my beard has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and stop wasting your money on those cheap big box stores all in one clippers when this does what you need better.</li>
            <li> and I liked it well enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li> The cost of trimmer was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and worth the money and does a neat job.</li>
            <li> The motor is so powerful it trips the gfi outlet in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if you want to use these clippers for super fine beard detailing, you should purchase an optional fine blade which you can switch out with the standard one.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that right out of the box.</li>
            <li> This cuts much closer and clean.</li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, easy to handle, durable and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I own both the Fast Feeds and 76&#x27;s, recently added this trimmer to my collection.  </li>
            <li> You should only press very lightly against the skin.</li>
            <li> However, the T-shaped end is very wide and good for straight lines.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected and was Brand New, a great compliment to the classic 76 clippers that I use.</li>
            <li> The first week after I used it, two women noticed and complimented me.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts very close and is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> My most recent purchase of the Oster Ac T-finisher quit working after one use.  </li>
            <li> I used these trimmers the first day after adjusting the blade</li>
            <li> When I first received it...</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed however, and I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, I just shave my head every week and have a goatee/mustache and need to keep those trimmed as well as my sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> , I had been recommended (by Amazon) and looked at/into the Oster T-Finisher Trimmer, not realizing at first that it was strictly a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; type of thing...  </li>
            <li> I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name</li>
            <li> Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  </li>
            <li> I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing them from amazon</li>
            <li> It does not provide a close or consistent shave.</li>
            <li> i used this for the first time yesterday after adjusting the blade to be a zero.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this one precisely because almost every professional barber shop that i have been t over the years seems to have this model.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and I am in the military.  </li>
            <li> I should have done that the first time.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton of videos on YouTube which show you how to do this, but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not difficult and should be adjusted before using anyway.</li>
            <li> In fact, you should inspect your clippers regularly to make sure that they haven&#x27;t gone out of alignment.</li>
            <li> Not my first and not my last thats for sure.  </li>
            <li> Oster is slightly larger and heavier, giving you more trimmer for your money in every way.  </li>
            <li> The signature tags fell off the first day I used them.</li>
            <li> Whereas I can quickly zip the Norelco trimmer around my face, this trimmer is harder to maneuver, and shaving with it is slower and more</li>
            <li> If you want your haircut to come out professional looking with clean edge detailing, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> This is a *PROFESSIONAL* shaver/clipper and therefore, as with most *PROFESSIONAL* level products, comes barebones;  you add the accessories that you want to add (if any)</li>
            <li> their and made me repeat the process at least once more, if not 2 or 3 times to make sure that it got everything...</li>
            <li> their and made me repeat the process at least once more, if not 2 or 3 times to make sure that it got everything...</li>
            <li> Note: the 76 does as good a job as the trimmer but is noisier, runs hotter and is more difficult because of its size to use on your self.</li>
            <li> I do wish the actual trimmer was a smaller plate width wise</li>
            <li> But, since it does run at such a low RPM, it&#x27;s a very nice break from the loudness of most other \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; and it does reduce irritation</li>

            <li> I got to outline three people before Christmas and was so excited because of how well they performed that I could hardly wait to do my own cut.</li>
            <li> fast shipping exactly as described</li>
            <li> love the cover , shipped promptly even with the long wait</li>
            <li> VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide...</li>
            <li> VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide...</li>
            <li> I have used the same Oster T-trimmer clipper (although mine is labeled (deluxe styler) for 40+ years and it just developed a cracked case in need of repair - it is  a great, professional tool; I am even able to order a new case for it - obviously this is  a tool made to used over a long time and repaired (not replaced): built to last!</li>
            <li> (I only had a certain amount of facial hair that needed shaving at the moment, etc &#x3D;]), and absolutely loved it, but, couldn&#x27;t really give it a proper test until I had to do a \\&quot;full service\\&quot; on my facial hair</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to handle and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep them clean and properly oiled and these should last years</li>
            <li> The cut was not a sharp, clean or close at all, it hurts against my skin, etc.</li>
            <li> This clipper works well and cuts very low, great for heavy use</li>
            <li> im a stylest at a fast paced salon and do hundreds of haircuts a month</li>
            <li> Like mowing a lawn with a wide mower &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> However, because of the wide blade, I can&#x27;t use it for so many things I was planning on using it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then you really can&#x27;t beat this Oster \\&quot;T-Finisher.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>

            <li> These are paired with my Oster Fast Feed just a lil while longer</li>
            <li> Really, any close than this</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes trimming around the ears much easier.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and on time..</li>
            <li> Was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought it for shaping and edging my beard and it does this very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.close shave.</li>
            <li> These clippers gives a really close cut.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of alternatives for clipping the paw pad hair and around the ears of our 8 year old Golden Retriever.</li>
            <li> Grooming the dog is now much easier</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation, quiet operation, didn&#x27;t over heat.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting to much.</li>
            <li> this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li> It has all and more what is expected.  </li>
            <li> But the most unexpected feature was how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> just loosen the two bolts on top , take out the blade and loosen the other two bolts and move the blade up to be flush with a table or something</li>
            <li> They also cut better than an other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The T head makes it easy to cut very selectively -- just a single hair, if that is what you want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, and very much  worth the small price difference.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the Oster cuts fast and close in just one pass, though it&#x27;s a little hard to be sure that the Wahl didn&#x27;t compare when it was new</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t moving super fast or anything, just standard head-shaving speed, but I wasn&#x27;t inching along</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t moving super fast or anything, just standard head-shaving speed, but I wasn&#x27;t inching along</li>
            <li> The Oster T-Trimmer is a very handy device for cutting beard growth, trimming moustaches, and the unit itself is quiet and very light in weight ..</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s a smooth hum, not a loud buzz.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the shaver as a whole, please don&#x27;t get me wrong &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> I usually love and trust Oster products, but this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> really do like the new one.</li>
            <li> This is a classic T-finisher.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t make the mistake of purchasing this pair of finishing clippers for an overall facial hair trimmer, then I think you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t make the mistake of purchasing this pair of finishing clippers for an overall facial hair trimmer, then I think you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have the Classic 76 to finish my set.</li>
            <li> overall i am very satisfied and several of my coworkers have already ordered the same model.  </li>
            <li> They just dont make any products as high of quality as this anymore.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Oster trimmer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The T Finisher is high quality</li>
            <li> as each kit I purchased came with one of each &#x3D;]), like scissors, clips/guides, combs, little things of oil, smocks/aprons to avoid getting hair on the person receiving a hair cut/shave, etc.</li>
            <li> (however, it was a little more than I was looking to spend at *that</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li> , I just have a normal mustache and goatee...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been procrastinating for a long time to purchase these, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> The cord is nicely long, but as with the Fast Feed trimmer, is kind of stiff and wants to retain the kinks when rolled.  </li>
            <li> I had a wahl peanut and this trims much closer and does not mess up my skin   like a blade would.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one because that one had no power, didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> It defeated the purpose of having new trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I went looking and found this new trimmer on line.</li>
            <li> These are my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; brand for trimmers and clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cost almost as much as a new trimmer to replace the battery</li>
            <li> so I bought the new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, Looks like I&#x27;ll be hoping for UPS to deliver the new one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> the trimmer really wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be(leaving traces of hair behind.)  </li>
            <li> and I figured that I&#x27;d get it later if these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers really did make that much of a difference, etc.)  </li>
            <li> that instead of trimming my mustache above my lip (so the hard stops at the top of my lip) easily, making a nice, straight line, I&#x27;d have to move the shaver itself all over the place just to get it to \\&quot;hook up\\&quot; and start cutting the hairs, as going straight on, it wouldn&#x27;t do anything; as if the amount of bristles/hair overwhelmed it...  </li>
            <li> Very professional finish.  </li>
            <li> These feed very fast and are very quiet.</li>
            <li> However, because of that width, I&#x27;m unable to shave most of the parts of my facial hair that I wanted to use it for because I can&#x27;t get it in the spot/space to shave it &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my barber his was looking old!</li>
            <li> Funny thing, when I received it&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be the same trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a very sharp and precise clipper to use when in-between the barber.  </li>
            <li> I quickly came to the realization that, unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to get rid of my existing pieces of junk just yet &#x3D;</li>
            <li> *, because I quickly found out that, due to the Lower RPM, it didn&#x27;t cut *everything* in it&#x27;s path when I moved it at the speed that I usually move my Wahl Senior Hair Clippers at when shaving my head w/ no clip...  Instead, it did cut a swatch/line out pretty good, it just left about 5% or less of the hair still</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a trimmer to replace my old clippers.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, but not especially close.</li>
            <li> have had no trouble and havent had to replace the blade yet</li>
            <li> Professionally built.  </li>
            <li> No problems so far.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist and appreciate how quite these are as well as my clients.</li>
            <li> It was a old trimmer, but still was working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even shave a 2 day old beard without it sticking.</li>
            <li> Ordered it as a replacement for old one that blade got rust (my fault).</li>
            <li> Trimmer was looks old and used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional trimmer.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;For a professional.</li>
            <li> Old pair are used to shave dogs foot pads.  </li>
            <li> The motor completely gave out.</li>
            <li> &quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc...</li>
            <li> &quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc...</li>
            <li> Well, if you just look at it, there&#x27;s a flat, slanted top plate that doesn&#x27;t move, that has a little metal comb on it.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting something with quality similar to the Classic 76 trimmer..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Overall, keep the blades clean and lubed and these clippers will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You need to hold the trimmer so that the slanted comb part is almost flat against your skin, at a slight angle so only the comb is touching your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the hair that grows under my bottom lip, to the left and right of the patch of hair that connects my bottom lip to my goatee in the center, when it grows, I shave it off, so there is a nice \\&quot;wide line\\&quot; (or patch) of hair down the middle under my lips...  </li>
            <li> They started out ok, but after about 8 or 9 months of using them may be once a week, the drive became noticeably weak.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve ever tried, there are no other kinds at Target, etc...</li>
            <li> Not sharp and</li>
            <li> But, to make sure my mustache stops at my upper lip, with the contours of my upper lip, the blade is too wide to use on either side, as I need something like, 1/2\\&quot; or 3/4\\&quot; wide instead..  </li>
            <li> The new packaging is a red color not grey.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair since high school</li>
            <li> Recommended by a professional hair stylist and built to last.</li>
            <li> So far, that is the only thing I could come up with that could be a con.  </li>
            <li> At roughly the same time, while comparing the two clippers I was interested in (the Wahl Senior &amp; the Oster *76)</li>
            <li> one\\&quot; solutions that came with a nice (fake) leather bag, etc.</li>
            <li> If your looking for one for home use this should be OKAY but not great</li>
            <li> it probably wasn&#x27;t even a whole 5% that it left behind, it was more like, a *lot* of little hairs that either didn&#x27;t get cut or didn&#x27;t get cut all of the way, and they were still sticking up; so it wasn&#x27;t a complete shave (for each line it did) - to do that, and get the results that I expect when shaving my head w/o a clip using my professional HAIR CLIPPERS from Wahl, not a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;finisher\\&quot;, I had to move the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\</li>

            <li> The thing is very simple to use, you don&#x27;t need any add-on combs or anything, and really gives your beard sharp definition for that professional look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people say the trimmers are not at all sharp and they don&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> cuts real close after I zero gapped it, (Just take off the screws then loosen the ones on the blade, and carefully line it up, not too close but close enough)</li>
            <li> I usually just do a quick \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s taken care of on either side with my piece of junk facial clippers w/o a clip...</li>
            <li> quiet operation, sharp blades that trim very close, and</li>
            <li> They are very quiet, but they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Be careful in the sensitive areas!  </li>
            <li> (it certainly didn&#x27;t cut as well after a few years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; very slow and basically give it time to cut everything, as the blades didn&#x27;t move fast enough (I think) to cut that much hair in that \\&quot;short\\&quot; of a time period</li>

            <li> Seems to Work like any other t-finisher but the look and something about the smell of these make me think they are old....</li>
            <li> As far as how sharp the blades are ...</li>
            <li> losing it&#x27;s charge, or simply due to the fact that the shaver is a complete piece of junk and that&#x27;s why it comes with everything and the kitchen sink for $19.99 or $23.99 at Target, etc..  </li>
            <li> As a professional, I&#x27;ll never again buy anything other than oster.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as I expected the blade seemed to be a little dull ok for standard clippers I guess . .</li>
            <li> and really wound up replacing whichever my current model was every year or even more often, depending on whether or not when I actually started using it, it was able to even do the job I needed it to (some are so weak or dull (not sharp), or they become weak and/or dull after a few charges/</li>
            <li> This may be a *VERY* desirable quality to have in something like the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, as it prevents something from happening that usually occurs when doing the sorts of things that the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; is used for (e.g. perhaps skin irritation, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a real Oster</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s cheapest trimmer is $18, and it is easier to use (but probably won&#x27;t last as long).  </li>
            <li> He uses one in his shop, and says they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not professional barber, I only use it on myself and my son.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I can tell it is going to last for years and years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that quiet pivot motor, so as with the Fast Feed, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re holding a sick chainsaw to your face.</li>
            <li> The business (blade) end of the Oster is slightly larger than that of the Wahl, but not so large as to be clumsy in any way (unless you&#x27;re trimming mice or the like).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very quiet compared to my other hair clippers, and it&#x27;s obviously slower in the speed in which it moves it&#x27;s blades back and forth...  </li>
            <li> *, as I do every Friday, with the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, since it&#x27;s got such a wide blade, I was curious as to whether it would save me any time or not... as well as to see how it would do and to see how it would feel, given that it apparently ran at a lower RPM than anything I&#x27;ve ever heard before, etc.  </li>
            <li> They do well for little designs and hard parts and cut super close around the ears and neckline</li>
            <li> I rather spend the real money and get a genuine set EXTREMELY disappointed</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not pros, just trying to save money long term.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how I have gone so long with out one of these.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t because I think they know after how long it gonna break.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a professional hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is somewhat fragile; b careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> and I have to bare down to get them to work.</li>
            <li> After going through several trimmers from your typical big box store.</li>
            <li> other thing that I&#x27;ve noticed about the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; is that it runs at a very low RPM...</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll wait at least a month before I give away my old liners.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little beast to primarily use as a buzzer for my face as i got tired of shaving every other day and getting irritated every time.  </li>
            <li> - it might also improve accuracy, or prevent accidental errors (because perhaps it&#x27;s not as sensitive to cutting off anything it touches compared with clippers that run at a higher RPM...</li>
            <li> this would be a terrible choice, as I would think it would be hard, if not impossible, to do nice, curved lines with a blade</li>
            <li> this would be a terrible choice, as I would think it would be hard, if not impossible, to do nice, curved lines with a blade</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this little pair of clippers for what I *</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this little pair of clippers for what I *</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely wide,</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so wide...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so wide...</li>
            <li> Came in the expected form.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and as expected.  </li>
            <li> There is not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I see that some have complained that these aren&#x27;t sharp enough, but I can&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not designed to be used as general purpose clippers and cannot be fitted with comb guards, so don&#x27;t even think about using these for cutting large swaths of hair.</li>
            <li> now its so sharp I have to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands and nobody does the job like oster.</li>
            <li> In order to maneuver the T-Finisher on my face, I had to hold the cord with my other hand to keep the cord from interfering.  </li>
            <li> Remington and other manufacturers also make cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the blade and now it cuts extremely well</li>
            <li> Been using this trimmer and replaced my other ones.</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t complain anymore after using this product as oppose to other cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li> **, as it&#x27;s very wide, allowing you do make *</li>
            <li> **, as it&#x27;s very wide, allowing you do make *</li>
            <li> The T-Finisher, at least for me (you may have a wider area/face or may be using it for something entirely different, etc.), is too wide to use on either side...</li>
            <li> Hair clippings were found in the blade teeth, the plastic around the top was unfinished,  and it made a horrific, loud noise when turned on.</li>
            <li> No frills but will trim your beard or any other hair it touches down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not clean neck as expected</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works very well, but the adjustment not being there makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Now with the blade adjusted down to a zero</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from the least expensive to the most expensive ($39.99 for the entire kit w/ clips, charging station, you name it...)</li>
            <li> with the Hair Clippers (as I&#x27;ve mentioned above), I&#x27;ve had a long track record of purchasing absolute *CRAP*</li>
            <li> Lining not sharp and very slow</li>
            <li> Probably half or a quarter the noise produced by this trimmer over what I&#x27;d been using before.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp and is capable of cutting almost blade-close.  </li>
            <li> The cord is thick and long, so you probably will pack it in a drawer every time if you like to keep your counters neat.</li>
            <li> but I found out that would be as expensive to buy some new oneas</li>
            <li> - it comes with a little steel triangle on the butt of it to hang it on a hook/nail that&#x27;s in the wall, etc.</li>
            <li> To get the closest trim I found that purchasing a Oster Cryonyx narrow hair trimmer blade is a must.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a bit clumsy to use due to its weight.</li>
            <li> Only con is that it is sometimes too sharp, it will prick the skin if pushed too hard at the wrong angle.  </li>
            <li> you hold the trimmer such that that moving blade part touches your skin, you will experience bad results, such as torn flesh.  </li>
            <li> Norelco trimmer is cordless, but the T-Finisher is corded -- and the cord is thick and heavy, not light or flexible.  </li>
            <li> Then, under that is a sharp cutting blade that moves back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really got a bad experience after bought this product.</li>
            <li> and wouldn&#x27;t die on me or get weak due to either the cordless/rechargeable battery (not a requirement in my book) getting weak/</li>
            <li> All my cordless ones in the past, the charge doesn&#x27;t hold and they could never cut the way these do.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it it ripped out a bunch of hairs and  my neck looked like a pound of bloody raw hamburger.  </li>
            <li> It hurts because your pressing to hard.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard case,</li>
            <li> The clipper head is dull and is attached tilted on the clippers.</li>
            <li> also tried to return the blades and the Seller gave me a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blade was dull out of the box so I&#x27;ll have to invest in another one</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair. I&#x27;m going to have to move the blade up and sharpen it for it to work. I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that right out of the box.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is a nice addition to my hair cutting tools</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really clean the way I was expecting</li>
            <li> My wife now cuts my hair and uses this trimmer.  We&#x27;re not pros, just trying to save money long term.  These work perfect for her.  Very clean cut, basically what they use at the salon.</li>
            <li> cleaning up you neck and cut</li>
            <li> My shaver is just great!  It was one of my best on-line purchases!</li>
            <li> Wished I would have bought it years ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent and shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine had a perfectly groomed beard, I asked him how he did it, he told me he had a T-finisher trimmer.  I ordered it and wow, my beard has never looked better.  The first week after I used it, two women noticed and complimented me.  The thing is very simple to use, you don&#x27;t need any add-on combs or anything, and really gives your beard sharp definition for that professional look.  Best grooming tool I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and have always used a wahl clipper. I have never owned a finisher but I don&#x27;t know how I have gone so long with out one of these. If you looking to just touch up between cut or do some finishing work these work great! The reason for the 4 start vs 5 is it would be nice if it came with a case for storage.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts very close and is quite powerful.  Only con is that it is sometimes too sharp, it will prick the skin if pushed too hard at the wrong angle.  Be careful in the sensitive areas!  Otherwise, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product because it is an Oster, but it does not trim good at all, my other treamer which is a \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; treams much better than that. I think I may have received a refurbish product because a new treamer no matter what brand would work better than this one. Do not buy it! It is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, I bought it November 17, and in last week which is  Feb 2, it lost power. I like to replace it but I can&#x27;t because I think they know after how long it gonna break. I had one before but I bought from store after 2 years it stopped working but this one not even three month. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Oster T-finisher Trimmer is an excellent, durable product.  The speedy delivery is greatly apreciated.  Pleasure doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these clippers. They turned on, but they were shaking and afterwards they didn&#x27;t even work! I&#x27;ll never ever buy these clippers again and I&#x27;m getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a trimmer to replace my old clippers. This is just what I needed to keep the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> I have purchased probably two Oster T-finishers over the years.  I have never experienced any problems.  They lasted about three years each.  My most recent purchase of the Oster Ac T-finisher quit working after one use.  It was not dropped or anything.  I think it is a good product.  They just sent me a defective one.  Too late to return now.</li>
            <li> Seems to Work like any other t-finisher but the look and something about the smell of these make me think they are old....the color of the red or maroon look like they are from 15 years ago when I began doing hair...great price and I love the t-finishers but hope they last...I&#x27;ll let you know if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to shave my neck and keep my manly scruff trimmed.     The first time I tried it it ripped out a bunch of hairs and  my neck looked like a pound of bloody raw hamburger.  I resisted the temptation to toss it into the trash.  I adjusted the blade (5 minutes) and it now cuts smooth and painlessly   leaving my neck as smooth as a babies bottom.  I had a wahl peanut and this trims much closer and does not mess up my skin   like a blade would.  It&#x27;s a good shaver but they must have a blind (or sadistic) person adjusting the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people say the trimmers are not at all sharp and they don&#x27;t cut very well. The cut was not a sharp, clean or close at all, it hurts against my skin, etc. First of all, as with most clippers you have to adjust the blade to make it shape your hairline, beard, mustache clean and close. It hurts because your pressing to hard. You should only press very lightly against the skin. As far as how sharp the blades are ... well, buy them and find out because i dont have an issue. I find that if you dont know how to use something you shouldnt leave bad feedback. I used these trimmers the first day after adjusting the blade and i couldnt be happier. They just dont make any products as high of quality as this anymore. It might have something to do with the MADE IN U.S.A thing. So if your looking for a great deal with a great product to give you amazing results, this is it. Also, if you need help on how to use them and adjust the blade go on youtube.</li>
            <li> This is a classic T-finisher.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> They started out ok, but after about 8 or 9 months of using them may be once a week, the drive became noticeably weak.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is good for trimming the ends of my beard and mustache. It cannot cut through anything thicker. However, the T-shaped end is very wide and good for straight lines.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a bit clumsy to use due to its weight. It cuts very well, but not especially close.</li>
            <li> This clipper works well and cuts very low, great for heavy use</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all, unless there is something am not getting. It trims very poorly even after adjustments.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one because that one had no power, didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I wanted to returned but I found out that would be as expensive to buy some new oneas and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with all they restocking charges and policies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair going on 3 years now.  The Oster products lived up to my expectations.  I own both the Fast Feeds and 76&#x27;s, recently added this trimmer to my collection.  When I first received it...the trimmer really wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be(leaving traces of hair behind.)  After adjusting the cutting blade you&#x27;ll get the desired edging like the barbers on the Internet videos.  This is a great item, ONLY if you adjust it as soon as you get it!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as I expected the blade seemed to be a little dull ok for standard clippers I guess . .</li>
            <li> it lines up really smooth no noise!!!! a must have trimer...fits n the palm of ur hand</li>
            <li> These are the best trimmers I&#x27;ve used, I like the blade on them and love how quiet they are. They do well for little designs and hard parts and cut super close around the ears and neckline</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The blades seem to be very dull. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very professional finish.  Love it.  Well worth the money. I highly recommend this product to anyone who like a nice and clean trim line.</li>
            <li> I love these there quit and smooth.</li>
            <li> totally love my trimmers they are durable and work wonders.. im a stylest at a fast paced salon and do hundreds of haircuts a month and ive had these for over a year have had no trouble and havent had to replace the blade yet</li>
            <li> Best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever had.  Great brand! I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands and nobody does the job like oster. Believe me I&#x27;m a hairstylist I use it for a living. :-)</li>
            <li> The t edger is the only trimmer I like to use and I&#x27;m a barber. It works great and gets around the ears the easiest.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the shaver as a whole, please don&#x27;t get me wrong &#x3D;]  It&#x27;s great quality, it&#x27;s Oster, it&#x27;s solid, etc. etc.  The first thing that I noticed however, and I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, I just shave my head every week and have a goatee/mustache and need to keep those trimmed as well as my sideburns, etc. and I got sick and tired of purchasing \\&quot;Hair Clipper Kits\\&quot; at Wal-Mart or an equivalent for ~$29.99 with *EVERYTHING* included (I *must* have 12 or more pairs of cheap scissors, combs, smocks, etc. as each kit I purchased came with one of each &#x3D;]), like scissors, clips/guides, combs, little things of oil, smocks/aprons to avoid getting hair on the person receiving a hair cut/shave, etc. and then having them die or become dull/useless after a year and having to go purchase another \\&quot;throw-away\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided I&#x27;d invest in a *nice*, professional pair of *MAGNETIC* Hair Clippers (I purchased the Wahl Senior in all Chrome (8505 or something) but I *ALMOST* went with the Oster *76 and it&#x27;s hard case, etc. (however, it was a little more than I was looking to spend at *that* time and I figured that I&#x27;d get it later if these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers really did make that much of a difference, etc.)  At roughly the same time, while comparing the two clippers I was interested in (the Wahl Senior &amp; the Oster *76), I had been recommended (by Amazon) and looked at/into the Oster T-Finisher Trimmer, not realizing at first that it was strictly a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; type of thing...  I thought it was another Oster model to compare with the *76, etc.  Once I realized that it was for trimming up things, beards, mustaches, sideburns, etc. I became even more interested in purchasing it as an add-on to whichever Clipper I opted to go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the Hair Clippers (as I&#x27;ve mentioned above), I&#x27;ve had a long track record of purchasing absolute *CRAP* at the big stores (Wal-Mart, etc.) to trim my beard, mustache, etc. and really wound up replacing whichever my current model was every year or even more often, depending on whether or not when I actually started using it, it was able to even do the job I needed it to (some are so weak or dull (not sharp), or they become weak and/or dull after a few charges/very short period of time, etc. that instead of trimming my mustache above my lip (so the hard stops at the top of my lip) easily, making a nice, straight line, I&#x27;d have to move the shaver itself all over the place just to get it to \\&quot;hook up\\&quot; and start cutting the hairs, as going straight on, it wouldn&#x27;t do anything; as if the amount of bristles/hair overwhelmed it...  and I&#x27;m not a *HAIRY* guy, I just have a normal mustache and goatee... not something off of a Wizard, etc. &#x3D;])  Therefore, I decided that, if I was going to go \\&quot;professional\\&quot; for my Hair Clippers which I use every week (I shave my head with no clip every Friday), then I might as well also invest the money and get a nice, professional trimmer for my mustache and goatee/beard (as I was just deciding whether to grow a beard or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ultimately why I bought the Oster T-Finisher.  I wasn&#x27;t originally looking for the T-Finisher specifically, it kind of fell into my lap and I desperately have been wanting a nice trimmer for my facial hair that had the power, etc. and wouldn&#x27;t die on me or get weak due to either the cordless/rechargeable battery (not a requirement in my book) getting weak/losing it&#x27;s charge, or simply due to the fact that the shaver is a complete piece of junk and that&#x27;s why it comes with everything and the kitchen sink for $19.99 or $23.99 at Target, etc..  However, if you&#x27;ve ever tried, there are no other kinds at Target, etc... those are the only ones that they carry... I&#x27;ve tried everything from the least expensive to the most expensive ($39.99 for the entire kit w/ clips, charging station, you name it...) - they all suffer from the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the T-Finisher, I immediately noticed the quality of it and was very pleased.  I was kind of \\&quot;upset\\&quot; or rather, disappointed I should say, that it didn&#x27;t have a case, etc. - but, then again, I had to remind myself that I was used to buying the \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; solutions that came with a nice (fake) leather bag, etc. etc. etc.  This is a *PROFESSIONAL* shaver/clipper and therefore, as with most *PROFESSIONAL* level products, comes barebones;  you add the accessories that you want to add (if any) - it comes with a little steel triangle on the butt of it to hang it on a hook/nail that&#x27;s in the wall, etc. (I&#x27;m guessing this is a common practice in Salons in which each station has a number of hooks/hangers in which to hang their clippers off of, etc...) - but, then I plugged it in and noticed how smooth it was, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade on it is very different from anything I was/am used to...  It&#x27;s extremely wide, hence the name/model of \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; &#x3D;]  So, I shaved what I could (I only had a certain amount of facial hair that needed shaving at the moment, etc &#x3D;]), and absolutely loved it, but, couldn&#x27;t really give it a proper test until I had to do a \\&quot;full service\\&quot; on my facial hair (if you will...)  Once I was able to use it as it was intended, or rather, as I intended, as a replacement for my pieces of junk, etc. I quickly came to the realization that, unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to get rid of my existing pieces of junk just yet &#x3D;[  With the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, the blade(s) are extremely wide, which is great for making long (width wise) even lines, etc.  Or, for \\&quot;clearing\\&quot; a large amount of surface area at once &#x3D;]  Like mowing a lawn with a wide mower &#x3D;]  However, because of that width, I&#x27;m unable to shave most of the parts of my facial hair that I wanted to use it for because I can&#x27;t get it in the spot/space to shave it &#x3D;]  It&#x27;s great for side-burns, it&#x27;s great for evening off either side of where my mustache connects to my goatee, so they are vertically straight and even.  But, to make sure my mustache stops at my upper lip, with the contours of my upper lip, the blade is too wide to use on either side, as I need something like, 1/2\\&quot; or 3/4\\&quot; wide instead..  Also, the hair that grows under my bottom lip, to the left and right of the patch of hair that connects my bottom lip to my goatee in the center, when it grows, I shave it off, so there is a nice \\&quot;wide line\\&quot; (or patch) of hair down the middle under my lips...  The T-Finisher, at least for me (you may have a wider area/face or may be using it for something entirely different, etc.), is too wide to use on either side... I usually just do a quick \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s taken care of on either side with my piece of junk facial clippers w/o a clip...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I&#x27;ve noticed about the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; is that it runs at a very low RPM... it&#x27;s very quiet compared to my other hair clippers, and it&#x27;s obviously slower in the speed in which it moves it&#x27;s blades back and forth...  I honestly don&#x27;t know the reason for this, as again, I&#x27;m not a professional hair dresser.  This may be a *VERY* desirable quality to have in something like the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, as it prevents something from happening that usually occurs when doing the sorts of things that the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; is used for (e.g. perhaps skin irritation, etc.) - it might also improve accuracy, or prevent accidental errors (because perhaps it&#x27;s not as sensitive to cutting off anything it touches compared with clippers that run at a higher RPM... I honestly don&#x27;t know, so please don&#x27;t take anything I just listed as things that it either does or does not do... I&#x27;m just hypothesizing...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try once to shave my entire head, with *NO CLIP*, as I do every Friday, with the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, since it&#x27;s got such a wide blade, I was curious as to whether it would save me any time or not... as well as to see how it would do and to see how it would feel, given that it apparently ran at a lower RPM than anything I&#x27;ve ever heard before, etc.  Well, I never did that again &#x3D;]  rofl...  It worked fine, my head got shaved, etc.  it just took *forever*, because I quickly found out that, due to the Lower RPM, it didn&#x27;t cut *everything* in it&#x27;s path when I moved it at the speed that I usually move my Wahl Senior Hair Clippers at when shaving my head w/ no clip...  Instead, it did cut a swatch/line out pretty good, it just left about 5% or less of the hair still their and made me repeat the process at least once more, if not 2 or 3 times to make sure that it got everything... it probably wasn&#x27;t even a whole 5% that it left behind, it was more like, a *lot* of little hairs that either didn&#x27;t get cut or didn&#x27;t get cut all of the way, and they were still sticking up; so it wasn&#x27;t a complete shave (for each line it did) - to do that, and get the results that I expect when shaving my head w/o a clip using my professional HAIR CLIPPERS from Wahl, not a \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; or \\&quot;finisher\\&quot;, I had to move the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; very slow and basically give it time to cut everything, as the blades didn&#x27;t move fast enough (I think) to cut that much hair in that \\&quot;short\\&quot; of a time period (I wasn&#x27;t moving super fast or anything, just standard head-shaving speed, but I wasn&#x27;t inching along *VERY* slowly or anything either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, *** DO NOT GET THESE CLIPPERS/SHAVER IF YOU PLAN TO SHAVE YOUR ENTIRE HEAD WITH IT ***  If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\&quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc... then the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; *** WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR THAT SORT OF APPLICATION ***, as it&#x27;s very wide, allowing you do make *VERY*, *VERY*, *VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide... if you need to go from your chin to your side-burns, this will do it in 3 \\&quot;swipes\\&quot; of the blade, and if you make sure to overlap a bit, so you stay with the original line made on the first swipe/cut made by the T-Finisher, it&#x27;ll made a completely straight edge all the way with no problems and no guide at all &#x3D;]  I can&#x27;t say enough about this little pair of clippers for what I *CAN* use it for.  However, because of the wide blade, I can&#x27;t use it for so many things I was planning on using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  If you just want to straighten out the line on the bottom of someone&#x27;s neck after a hair cut, trim side-burns evenly, etc. then you really can&#x27;t beat this Oster \\&quot;T-Finisher.\\&quot;  If you want to do \\&quot;sculpting\\&quot; or whatever where you shave curved lines, etc., I *think* this would be a terrible choice, as I would think it would be hard, if not impossible, to do nice, curved lines with a blade that&#x27;s so wide... but, I&#x27;ve not tried it, so, don&#x27;t take my word for that, I just don&#x27;t see how it would be done given the width of the clipper&#x27;s blade(s)...  But, since it does run at such a low RPM, it&#x27;s a very nice break from the loudness of most other \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; and it does reduce irritation I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, as it&#x27;s used for \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; type things..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t make the mistake of purchasing this pair of finishing clippers for an overall facial hair trimmer, then I think you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied with the product, it&#x27;s performance, the quality, etc..  Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  The price for these clippers is perfect too!  For that price, these clippers will last you decades, not months or years (depending on use obviously, I&#x27;m referring to if/when used personally, not when used commercially at a salon, etc...)  So, if you think of it like that, it&#x27;s *** WELL WORTH IT ***worked fine, my head got shaved, etc.  it just took *forever*, because I quickly found out that, due to the Lower RPM, it didn&#x27;t cut *everything* in it&#x27;s path when I moved it at the speed that I usually move my Wahl Senior Hair Clippers at when shaving my head w/ no clip...

So, *** DO NOT GET THESE CLIPPERS/SHAVER IF YOU PLAN TO SHAVE YOUR ENTIRE HEAD WITH IT ***  If you have one of those goatees that kind of \\&quot;outlines your face\\&quot; - going from side-burn to side-burn and is a kind of \\&quot;thin line\\&quot; that goes around your jaw bone and meets at either a goatee or something else on your chin, etc... then the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot; *** WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR THAT SORT OF APPLICATION ***, as it&#x27;s very wide, allowing you do make *VERY*, *VERY*, *VERY*, straight edges and for more than just an inch or two wide... if you need to go from your chin to your side-burns, this will do it in 3 \\&quot;swipes\\&quot; of the blade, and if you make sure to overlap a bit, so you stay with the original line made on the first swipe/cut made by the T-Finisher, it&#x27;ll made a completely straight edge all the way with no problems and no guide at all &#x3D;]  I can&#x27;t say enough about this little pair of clippers for what I *CAN* use it for.  However, because of the wide blade, I can&#x27;t use it for so many things I was planning on using it for.    Overall, just be sure that you know what you are buying.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money, and it&#x27;ll probably last forever with proper care and handling.  However, take some measurements and look at the specs online to ensure that it will fit whatever you plan on using it for.  If you just want to straighten out the line on the bottom of someone&#x27;s neck after a hair cut, trim side-burns evenly, etc. then you really can&#x27;t beat this Oster \\&quot;T-Finisher.\\&quot;  If you want to do \\&quot;sculpting\\&quot; or whatever where you shave curved lines, etc., I *think* this would be a terrible choice, as I would think it would be hard, if not impossible, to do nice, curved lines with a blade that&#x27;s so wide... but, I&#x27;ve not tried it, so, don&#x27;t take my word for that, I just don&#x27;t see how it would be done given the width of the clipper&#x27;s blade(s)...  But, since it does run at such a low RPM, it&#x27;s a very nice break from the loudness of most other \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; and it does reduce irritation I think when using it, although, admittedly, it&#x27;s not used for the same things that most \\&quot;Hair Clippers\\&quot; are used for; hence the name the \\&quot;T-Finisher\\&quot;, as it&#x27;s used for \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; type things..    If you don&#x27;t make the mistake of purchasing this pair of finishing clippers for an overall facial hair trimmer, then I think you&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied with the product, it&#x27;s performance, the quality, etc..  Just know what you want and make sure you really know what you&#x27;ll be getting, and you should be fine.  The price for these clippers is perfect too!  For that price, these clippers will last you decades, not months or years (depending on use obviously, I&#x27;m referring to if/when used personally, not when used commercially at a salon, etc...)  So, if you think of it like that, it&#x27;s *** WELL WORTH IT ***</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my barber his was looking old!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very good. It replaced the same brand trimmer that was accidently dropped and damaged. There is no pinching and it cuts beautifully. Price on Amazon was the lowest I found. I highly recommend this Oster trimmer.</li>
            <li> Perfect companion to my Oster Fast Feed clippers. I have used these clippers for trimming around ears and neck lines.</li>
            <li> I zero gapped these and they are perfect for lining up. These are paired with my Oster Fast Feed just a lil while longer and I&#x27;ll have the Classic 76 to finish my set. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  I have been cutting my own hair since high school and this is the best edger I have used.  It gets really close and is easy to hold and control.  My wife does much of my edging and has said she thinks it&#x27;s easy to use and does a good job.  Really, any close than this and you are talking using a razor.  Solid.</li>
            <li> This thing mows hair like a champ. One can trim with precision.  I&#x27;ve had mine a year and used it 30 times.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great on trimming the neck line and over the ears.  Professionally built.  Recommended by a professional hair stylist and built to last.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes trimming around the ears much easier. It&#x27;s high quality and very quiet. I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers for years and been very happy with them. This was my first time purchasing them from amazon and I was very disappointed. The clipper head is dull and is attached tilted on the clippers. It does not provide a close or consistent shave. It also pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and use my trimmers about 15-20 times a day... These are by far the best trimmers I have owned. Very easy to line up my clients. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but the trimmers are refurbished. They are perfectly fine I only wish they would&#x27;ve said they were refurbished. I should&#x27;ve realized it when I saw the price.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and on time..&lt;br /&gt;no problems&lt;br /&gt;i do recomend.</li>
            <li> Works well but supplied blades leave stubble.</li>
            <li> When I opened them they had red hair all over them!!!  Not sharp and my guess that is why they were returned before!!!</li>
            <li> Perferct trimmer for my work. I had one of these before for more than 10 years. Now is the time for a new one :D</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best workhorse ever.  As a professional, I&#x27;ll never again buy anything other than oster.</li>
            <li> I only use this for trimming my mustache and goatee.  I use a balding clipper for grooming the rest of the face and with a guard to cut my goatee to length.  Picked this brand because my barber uses the same.</li>
            <li> I am dissatisfired with it. It does not cut or do the lining as the andis brand which i have had for years. So i can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to handle and very quiet.  The blade is sharp and is capable of cutting almost blade-close.  The T head makes it easy to cut very selectively -- just a single hair, if that is what you want.  The clipper is somewhat fragile; b careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little beast to primarily use as a buzzer for my face as i got tired of shaving every other day and getting irritated every time.  i used this for the first time yesterday after adjusting the blade to be a zero.  just loosen the two bolts on top , take out the blade and loosen the other two bolts and move the blade up to be flush with a table or something and you have your self a close shave as if its a blade. worked great on my face and body hair. There is almost no fatigue from the vibration as it is very mild and almost unnoticeable. the motor is very powerful and can handle the toughest hair with ease.  overall i am very satisfied and several of my coworkers have already ordered the same model.  i purchased this one precisely because almost every professional barber shop that i have been t over the years seems to have this model. buy with confidence.  Plus when you buy from amazon they now have a warehouse in PA so if your in that area you get it within a day with prime and without.</li>
            <li> Was more than I expected. Very happy. Price was very good! I would definitely purchase again. Hopefully, won&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Terrible trimmer. The teeth are so shallow they don&#x27;t even trim like they are supposed to. They skip and I have to bare down to get them to work. I usually love and trust Oster products, but this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome detail trimmer....  Quiet and efficient</li>
            <li> Excellent pair of clippers.  Cuts close enough to be used as a razor for shaving if need be.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I have used this T-Blade forever you really  great quality</li>
            <li> This works great. I love that it doesn&#x27;t rely on batteries which always degrade over time.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done... at a very good price. No problems so far. I would recommend it. Thank u.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged. Came in the expected form. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on all my clients as a stylist. Great job.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and trimmers work great</li>
            <li> Works just like the one my barber uses when I go in to get my hair cut.  This is a very sharp and precise clipper to use when in-between the barber.  Do yourself a favor and stop wasting your money on those cheap big box stores all in one clippers when this does what you need better.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve seen and I have had many over the years.  Good for dogs and for boys!</li>
            <li> it works great. ! I actually purchased one at the store on sale for 63 bucks, and it didn&#x27;t  work at all. So i took a chance and ordered this one instead. Saved 20 dollars and got a working machine.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and as expected.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Lining not sharp and very slow</li>
            <li> Very nice product i own 2 of them......the more you use them the better they cut.....would definitely recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> Close cut as described.  I cut my own hair and I am in the military.  This works perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I Think These have always been the best trimmers, A Must Have Get Your&#x27;s Before I Buy Again At That Price!!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming up neck fur between haircuts. Saved enough to pay for itself in a couple months. And it keeps my boys looking clean cut.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my haircutting guy-- they&#x27;re the ones he uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really strong motor, and totally safe to use on the special places.</li>
            <li> saved me a lot of money, great product.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say.  From my experience, the blades were not sharpened.  It defeated the purpose of having new trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to return the blades and the Seller gave me a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> fast shipping exactly as described</li>
            <li> When I received this, it was obvious that the item had been used. Hair clippings were found in the blade teeth, the plastic around the top was unfinished,  and it made a horrific, loud noise when turned on. I sent it back immediately and ordered an Andis Styliner 2 instead.</li>
            <li> They are very quiet, but they are not very sharp. I use these trimmers for shaving and I have to apply a lot of pressure to account for the dullness.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was disappointed at first it was small and dirty from the packaging and when I tried to use it it didnt shave close at all. I was about to try and return it when I say a review said they adjusted the blade so I looked up how to adjust it and now its so sharp I have to be careful with it. Now with the blade adjusted down to a zero its a very good trimmer light weight quiet and easy to handle.    here&#x27;s the link on how to adjust it (...)    just with this blade adjust the bar that holds the blade</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist and appreciate how quite these are as well as my clients. They also cut better than an other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this through Amazon, but thought I&#x27;d write a short review anyway.  The cord is nicely long, but as with the Fast Feed trimmer, is kind of stiff and wants to retain the kinks when rolled.  So far, that is the only thing I could come up with that could be a con.  I bought it for shaping and edging my beard and it does this very well.  It trims close, but does not pinch or cut the skin.  The hair also feeds into the blade easily, so shaping isn&#x27;t a challenge. It does a great job of trimming the hair off this old guy&#x27;s ears too.  It&#x27;s got that quiet pivot motor, so as with the Fast Feed, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re holding a sick chainsaw to your face. It&#x27;s pricey as compared to the box store trimmers, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Being retired, and hating to shave, I recently purchased a Norelco trimmer to shave my face with.  I don&#x27;t care at this point if I always have stubble.  I was happy with the Norelco trimmer, but I figured that I would be even happier with a professional product, so I got this T-Finisher.  However, it&#x27;s not at all good for shaving your face -- and for obvious reasons that I wish I had thought of before I got it.  (Before I continue, let me say that I called Oster up and was advised to get this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco trimmer is cordless, but the T-Finisher is corded -- and the cord is thick and heavy, not light or flexible.  The heavy cord made it difficult to maneuver the T-Finisher around my face.  In order to maneuver the T-Finisher on my face, I had to hold the cord with my other hand to keep the cord from interfering.  In addition, this being a quality product made of metal, it is three or four times heavier than the Norelco trimmer.  Whereas I can quickly zip the Norelco trimmer around my face, this trimmer is harder to maneuver, and shaving with it is slower and more laborious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a barber and you are buying this trimmer to use on the necks of your customers, by all means get it -- it is a quality product.  But if you are a consumer looking for something to shave your face with, this T-Finisher isn&#x27;t suitable.  Norelco&#x27;s cheapest trimmer is $18, and it is easier to use (but probably won&#x27;t last as long).  Remington and other manufacturers also make cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li> The trimmers had to be cleaned because of the box it came with but after everything was done, these clippers performed well. Good quiet motor and I moved the blade closer for a sharper cut with great results. With any clipper or trimmer, daily maintenance is required for the life of the blade. A good purchase indeed.</li>
            <li> I have used this only once, I have been cutting my son&#x27;s hair to avoid $12 payments.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for 25 years and was disappointed that it &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.  We were very happy to find a new one and realize it is just as wonderful as the first one.  Oster makes a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these trimmers before so no surprise that I will  and have always like them.  I have been in the business over forty years, hopefully I know what I&#x27;m talking about. Thank you!  JAG</li>
            <li> Best trimmer hands down. I adjusted the blade and now it cuts extremely well</li>
            <li> Works very well.close shave.</li>
            <li> These clippers gives a really close cut. This product is incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the same Oster T-trimmer clipper (although mine is labeled (deluxe styler) for 40+ years and it just developed a cracked case in need of repair - it is  a great, professional tool; I am even able to order a new case for it - obviously this is  a tool made to used over a long time and repaired (not replaced): built to last!</li>
            <li> 9/12/14. Easy to use effective trimmer. I tried a lot of alternatives for clipping the paw pad hair and around the ears of our 8 year old Golden Retriever. My Oster Outlaw clipper with the #10 cutter head just would not do the job, although that was what I bought that one for.  Small scissors were just to difficult to avoid actually cutting the skin, and a Wahl cordless trimmer just would not cut at all (JUNK!). The Oster Ac T-finisher Trimmer # 76059-010 works great. I got it after talking to my personal barber and he showed me the type of cutter head to get. I should have done that the first time.  Grooming the dog is now much easier and she doesn&#x27;t mind the low noise vibrations of the Oster trimmer, whereas she hated any attempt to use the noisy bigger unit.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and price.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are amazing for detail and edge work. I&#x27;ve been procrastinating for a long time to purchase these, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did. If you want your haircut to come out professional looking with clean edge detailing, this is what you need. I see that some have complained that these aren&#x27;t sharp enough, but I can&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible. I suspect that some people don&#x27;t realize that these clippers have to be zero-gapped in order for them to work properly. There&#x27;s a ton of videos on YouTube which show you how to do this, but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not difficult and should be adjusted before using anyway. In fact, you should inspect your clippers regularly to make sure that they haven&#x27;t gone out of alignment. Please note that these clippers are for detail and edge work only. They&#x27;re not designed to be used as general purpose clippers and cannot be fitted with comb guards, so don&#x27;t even think about using these for cutting large swaths of hair. Also, if you want to use these clippers for super fine beard detailing, you should purchase an optional fine blade which you can switch out with the standard one. Overall, keep the blades clean and lubed and these clippers will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The lever that adjusts the trim on the side broke.  Otherwise, it works very well, but the adjustment not being there makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer. The blades are supper sharpe making it so easy to trim my beard. My barber recommended this unit. He uses one in his shop, and says they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> This T Finisher works great! It came sooner than expected and was Brand New, a great compliment to the classic 76 clippers that I use.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago a barber friend gave me a Oster hair trimmer to help me trim my beard. It was a old trimmer, but still was working.&lt;br /&gt;About 2wks ago it stopped working. Well I decided to tear it apart and fix it myself, BAD IDEA. Sometime things just don&#x27;t go&lt;br /&gt;back together the same way. Struck Out. So I went looking and found this new trimmer on line. Funny thing, when I received it&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be the same trimmer. I thought the old one was great, this one #1. Seller was very quick to deliver product, It came&lt;br /&gt;packaged well, Over All. A++++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it was a shaver as well</li>
            <li> Returned item.  Does not clean neck as expected</li>
            <li> These are very nice &amp; perfect priceðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Fake trimmers. Extremely weak motor NO way an oster brand. Can&#x27;t even shave a 2 day old beard without it sticking. I rather spend the real money and get a genuine set EXTREMELY disappointed</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great! cuts real close after I zero gapped it, (Just take off the screws then loosen the ones on the blade, and carefully line it up, not too close but close enough) Been using this trimmer and replaced my other ones. Overall great results and great buy.  Trimmers still cutting like I just bought them! Especially after changing the blade to a T-Shaving blade. This cuts much closer and clean. Just make sure to keep them clean and properly oiled and these should last years</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job. Easy to use. Very quiet.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his trimmer and uses it to keep his side burns and neck hair trimmed nice and tidy between haircuts. great for ladies too.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by the person that&#x27;s been cutting my hair for over 20 years for clean-ups in between cuts!</li>
            <li> This is the pros model. My daughter is a hair stylist in NY and this is only one she uses.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these from sally for over 50 bucks and returned it the next day. I like Oster but do not like the trimmer. You would think that it would be in the league of andis outliner, wahl detailer, or the styliners, but this more of a consumer product. May be good for fine hair salons, but not for line ups and sharp crisp shapeups. Horrible for beards too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a real Oster</li>
            <li> fast shipping great quality and best price on the weg</li>
            <li> efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Oster T-Trimmer is a very handy device for cutting beard growth, trimming moustaches, and the unit itself is quiet and very light in weight ..a truly nice unit to have for sideburn, beard growth and moustache trimming !</li>
            <li> The Oster T-Finisher trimmer is the best trimmer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet operation, sharp blades that trim very close, and Amazon has the best prices with fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Blade was dull out of the box so I&#x27;ll have to invest in another one but this oster is quiet and gets the job done. Nice one Oster.</li>
            <li> love the cover , shipped promptly even with the long wait I was very pleased with the product when it got here</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price. I use it every week to keep clean look.</li>
            <li> Great for lining your hair.</li>
            <li> This is very sweet. I love it. Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have used it for about two years on my beard and for my hairline. It is a very good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had one before and I liked it well enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  Extremely sharp and strong.  The cord is thick and long, so you probably will pack it in a drawer every time if you like to keep your counters neat.</li>
            <li> I thought all Oster clippers were top of the line. Boy was I wrong about this one. Took it to my barber to see if he can adjust it and he also said it&#x27;s no good. I returned it. And stayed with my andis outliner I I.</li>
            <li> No working well what a  stupid shop</li>
            <li> I received the Ac T-Finisher trimmer and wanted to used it with guards for my beard. The directions showed how to snap them on but there wasn&#x27;t a packing slip indicating what comes in the package and no guards were included. I called Oster to see if the Universal 10 pack of blades would work with the T Finisher. They said no but two guards should have been included and sense they weren&#x27;t I may have been shipped someone else&#x27;s return. I got in touch with North East, the vendor using Amazon to distribute their products and asked them to send the guards. They wouldn&#x27;t so I sent it back. It also turns out that is was in a discontinued packaging. The new packaging is a red color not grey. The T Finisher is high quality but I advise not to purchase from North East.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist, you would think cords are not the way to go. Quite to opposite.  Cordless trimmers do not hold a flame to these. All my cordless ones in the past, the charge doesn&#x27;t hold and they could never cut the way these do. These feed very fast and are very quiet. They make perfect edges and are not too heavy. I will never go back to cordless. These are my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; brand for trimmers and clippers.</li>
            <li> It worked as published on advertisement.  Smooth operation, quiet operation, didn&#x27;t over heat.  The cost of trimmer was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it to trim around the ears, mustache and sideburns and it ended up totally replacing the Oster 76 clipper which I had bought 2 weeks before. Note: the 76 does as good a job as the trimmer but is noisier, runs hotter and is more difficult because of its size to use on your self. To get the closest trim I found that purchasing a Oster Cryonyx narrow hair trimmer blade is a must. I use this combination to to do all of my hair and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Anther perch is that my wife can easily use it as well for her bikini cuts etc.</li>
            <li> It works ok but I was expecting something with quality similar to the Classic 76 trimmer.. Maybe I was expecting to much.</li>
            <li> I replaced a very similar Oster trimmer that was rechargeable because the battery died.&lt;br /&gt;It cost almost as much as a new trimmer to replace the battery so I bought the new one.&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the new one. it is easy to handle and does an excellent job</li>
            <li> I am Barber and have used this model for years, the best, very happy with shipping and time to me.</li>
            <li> Ordered it as a replacement for old one that blade got rust (my fault). I&#x27;m not professional barber, I only use it on myself and my son. I like Oster finisher, sturdy, precise, very easy to maintain, works for years (if you clean it properly and oil it). Good simple product, does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> Perfect for haircuting, could not ask for a better set of finishers, I would highly recommend these to anyone who cuts hair</li>
            <li> i really got a bad experience after bought this product.Trimmer was looks old and used. And after using it i felt itchy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to return this product but i didn&#x27;t got any reply from retailer.&lt;br /&gt;it was such a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional trimmer. And well let&#x27;s just say u get wat u paid for. If your looking for one for home use this should be OKAY but not great&lt;br /&gt;For a professional.</li>
            <li> Saves time and money by trimming my husband and 2 boys hair. It&#x27;s sturdy and worth the money and does a neat job.</li>
            <li> After going through several trimmers from your typical big box store. I thought I&#x27;d check out &amp;#34;professional grade&amp;#34; product. I&#x27;m glad I did, and very much  worth the small price difference. Shaves are closer and I feel the blades are sharper(doesnt even feel like I&#x27;m snagging) than the big box variety. But the most unexpected feature was how quiet it is. Probably half or a quarter the noise produced by this trimmer over what I&#x27;d been using before. Would recommend over and over. I&#x27;m using this personally to keep my sideburns in check as well as to pre-shave my face before using a razor.</li>
            <li> Great value; received as advertised.  Quiet, powerful, easy to handle, durable and cuts cleanly.  Excellent quality!  On/off switch is smooth.</li>
            <li> The clippers had hair trimmings and dust on them.  The only reason I did not give it one stars is because I did not use them.  They might have worked fine, but i returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for at-home haircuts. My purchase decision was based on input from barbers/salon workers. For months, I would quietly ask barbers/stylists what type of equipment they recommended. The vast majority--maybe 95-100%--recommended Oster for trimmers and finishers like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I can tell it is going to last for years and years. Build quality is great, and it just feels like a professional gadget when you hold it in your hand. Does a very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> These are the only trimmers that I use! I love them and at such a great price! They arrived in great time. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not my first and not my last thats for sure.  Cut supper close.  Great quality.  Old pair are used to shave dogs foot pads.  Just a really great item at a great price</li>
            <li> The motor is so powerful it trips the gfi outlet in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a solid ingot in your hand. No frills but will trim your beard or any other hair it touches down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last pair of trimmers I will have to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good bye cheap Wahl trimmers I had to replace every five years.</li>
            <li> Works amazing glad I made the purchase highly recommend this item. Tried the rest this is the best. Razors don&#x27;t do the job and battery operated trimmers suck</li>
            <li> I finally need to replace my blade after 20 years. Awesome product. Nice clean lines. Wouldn&#x27;t use anythingelse when finishing a haircut .....</li>
            <li> The blades stopped moving after one week. I got to outline three people before Christmas and was so excited because of how well they performed that I could hardly wait to do my own cut. Well, Looks like I&#x27;ll be hoping for UPS to deliver the new one&#x27;s I had to order by Christmas cause I haven&#x27;t had to pay a barber in 35 years. Next time I&#x27;ll wait at least a month before I give away my old liners.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk, broke after 5 month of use. The motor completely gave out.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived fine and timely.</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and I have used this about 6 times since we bought it.  I really love this electric trimmer.  I do wish the actual trimmer was a smaller plate width wise but I have learned how to use it quite well.</li>
            <li> we replaced an oster trimer  that broke after a big drop we knew what we were geting the price is great</li>
            <li> Good finisher, order the T Shaving blade for a closer cut. Quality clipper</li>
            <li> I purchase this at least once a year as I am a stylist (of 8 years)and this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li> works, is slient, much better than the crappy wahls brand...</li>
            <li> This Oster AC T-Finisher Trimmer is great. The size is good and it works well.. My husband loves it to shave his facial hair</li>
            <li> My wife used it to trim the back of my head and ears, so I do not have to go get a haircut so often. It has good power, unlike the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this</li>
            <li> After four years, I managed to wreck my Wahl Five-Star Trimmer, and decided to try the slightly more expensive Oster ($40 vs. $45) to see what it&#x27;s like.  Glad I wrecked my Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the aesthetics of the Oster much, at least compared to the Wahl.  The Oster has a tough, boring red plastic shell; the Wahl had pearlescent and metallized plastics.  But that&#x27;s the last good thing I can say about the Wahl now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oster is slightly larger and heavier, giving you more trimmer for your money in every way.  The Oster motor is rated at 8 Watts -- double the Wahl -- yet the Oster makes 1/4 the noise: it&#x27;s a smooth hum, not a loud buzz.  The business (blade) end of the Oster is slightly larger than that of the Wahl, but not so large as to be clumsy in any way (unless you&#x27;re trimming mice or the like).  Most importantly, the Oster cuts fast and close in just one pass, though it&#x27;s a little hard to be sure that the Wahl didn&#x27;t compare when it was new (it certainly didn&#x27;t cut as well after a few years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final judgement: Oster T-Finisher crushes Wahl Five-Star by a country mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: the instructions really don&#x27;t talk about the most important topic: how do you use the trimmer?  Well, if you just look at it, there&#x27;s a flat, slanted top plate that doesn&#x27;t move, that has a little metal comb on it.  Then, under that is a sharp cutting blade that moves back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hold the trimmer such that that moving blade part touches your skin, you will experience bad results, such as torn flesh.  You need to hold the trimmer so that the slanted comb part is almost flat against your skin, at a slight angle so only the comb is touching your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then move the trimmer as if you&#x27;re using that tiny comb to comb your hair -- but backwards, against the grain.  If you do this, it cuts close, quick, and safe.  Truly a super trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The signature tags fell off the first day I used them.</li>
            <li> It has all and more what is expected.  My kids don&#x27;t complain anymore after using this product as oppose to other cheaper brands.  It&#x27;s smooth and the product trims so neat and clean.  The brand name and this product lives up to it&#x27;s name and reputation!</li>
