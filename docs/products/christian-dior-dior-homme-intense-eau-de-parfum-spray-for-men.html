            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Real great for the first six to eight hours.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s even better that someone can buy it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>like im wearing a lot of makeup kind of feel.</li>
            <li>The scent is &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; and warm and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many good feelings from the aroma and</li>
            <li>A well blended designer fragrance indeed with good silliage and longevity its a must-have for most.</li>
            <li>I love it,and it is very potent.</li>
            <li>Strong odor, and good for events.</li>
            <li>i love how delicious it smells and how much compliments i get.</li>
            <li>So sexy and elegant, will recommend for my friends!</li>
            <li>This smells nice, but a bit overwhelming with chemical feel</li>
            <li>Two quick shots and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>It smells as sexy as how the bottle looks.    </li>
            <li>Most guys are wearing some crappy Aqua type smell that they put on in 7 sprays and is vomit inducing.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent ever.  </li>
            <li>MORE LIKE A NICHE AND NOT A DESIGNER .</li>
            <li>I have over 40 colognes in my collection, this is a top 5 for date nights.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this smell</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic cologne!  </li>
            <li>I would say the EDT is better for office setting; but EDP is really much better for clubbing or date night.  </li>
            <li>I love this one - my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>i think it is more for the 25+ crowd</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s elusive to description and even more so to the nose.</li>
            <li>and then just enjoying the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great, very classy!</li>
            <li>Great scent, highly recommended</li>
            <li>a very clean smell</li>
            <li>The longevity is pretty good, with notes detectable during midnight hanky panky from a 3 PM application.</li>
            <li>This is a good fragrance, very hyped.</li>
            <li>True, you will spend 30% or even 40% more at the mall, but don&#x27;t go by online reviews.</li>
            <li>This is warm, kind, and generally intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Arrived at my house quickly!</li>
            <li>Something that females would be attracted to and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I think it fits on women or very feminine men, it would smell amazing.</li>
            <li>and i got free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the Cologne</li>
            <li>It appears what I received is genuine stuff.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>WOULD APPRECIATE IF ITS AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li>The cologne I received was a genuine DHI with a batch code corresponding to July 2014.</li>
            <li>It has great notes and there is a mild makeup/lipstick vibe in initial spray.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells great and it lasts a long.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, get a sample and see if you like it first.</li>
            <li>SMELLS UNIQUE .BEHAVES</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t familiar with.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Numerous girls (&amp;#62;5) have commended me on how nice I smell :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, just on special occasions or when I know that I will be around and about until the evening.</li>
            <li>A sweet smelling shabby looking guy still won&#x27;t get noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The opening is woodsy, settling with a powdery sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the regular Dior Homme, Beware.  </li>
            <li>Works well in cool weather.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to the supermarket or to work, it is more suited for dimmed lighting and sophisticated social events.</li>
            <li>a bit pricey compared to some other great fragrances out there</li>
            <li>Super price</li>
            <li>Smells good but not sure if it&#x27;s authentic?</li>
            <li>Smells unique in every way,more to wear as a gentleman,more  for a pretty boy fits the profile for this cologne.</li>
            <li>I wish i could wear this more often as i see this only fitting for certain occassions.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would be considered sexy and classy.</li>
            <li>its is a different kind of cologne that I have not come across.</li>
            <li>well worth the money to any mens cologne/parfume collection.</li>
            <li>Is this worth the $100+ after shipping?</li>
            <li>This EDP is enticing and definitely worth obtaining even if you have the EDT</li>
            <li>, it is more of an Amazon issue; they are selling old colognes that are on the verge of being obsolete.</li>
            <li>Warm, rich, deep and intimate</li>
            <li>I am sure it smells better on other people</li>
            <li>and they are right</li>
            <li>WHICH IN MY OPINION IS THE RIGHT PRICE FOR THIS.</li>
            <li>tuxedo occasion that isa slightly less formal but still elegant and sophisticated event.</li>
            <li>oh the delivery was done very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where I live, this is a unique smell.</li>
            <li>so you more than likely wont smell like everyone else when you go out somewhere.</li>
            <li>Not sure where to start :) I love the way this EDP smells.  </li>
            <li>; that is exactly what I get.</li>
            <li>one of the top perfumes to attrack opposite sexes.</li>
            <li>The sweetness has a small hint of powdery soap at the very top that keeps this parfum from being too sweet.</li>
            <li>Paid for Dior Homme Intense, but received Dior Homme!</li>
            <li>exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>First, purchasing cologne online is always risky--fakes are rampant.</li>
            <li>At first you smell the iris, lipstick-like scent but that soon becomes vanilla.</li>
            <li>I actually sprayed 4 to 5 times on my neck, and although the smell was great,  it died down pretty quickly within 2 hours....</li>
            <li>After the first 30-45 minutes it really opens up and becomes heavenly.</li>
            <li>After reviewing a lot of positive reviews on youtube and here on this scent, I was very eager to receive it and wear it.</li>
            <li>Well I must say, I have only had this on a short while, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and now this Dior Homme Intense.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as intense as advertised.</li>
            <li>its too much for me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Perfect cold weather scent for anybody.</li>
            <li>I understand liking for a perfume is very subjective</li>
            <li>This Parfum is not smell AT ALL like real Dior.</li>
            <li>Be ready for this as this is an all day parfum for men.</li>
            <li>Dior Homme Intense is a master piece.</li>
            <li>I dont like it much.</li>
            <li>Is very well blended.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t to say it isn&#x27;t intense, it is.</li>
            <li>I sometimes wear the EDP out on dates with my girlfriend, it&#x27;s strong though so not very frequently.</li>
            <li>I wont get into describing the fragrance much, you can find that info anywhere, but upon first impression, this is a winner and my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>Great iris opening and chocolate dry down.</li>
            <li>Very complex, sophisticated, and just overall nice.</li>
            <li>Even thought is says intense, it is missing the good parts of the regular DH.</li>
            <li>and in the less is more category.</li>
            <li>Warm, intense, complex, spicy vanilla.</li>
            <li>The first thing I thought of when I smelled it was an old rich woman that is single.</li>
            <li>The smell of it is very unique, slightly feminine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A high end scent without the high end price.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and find that any scent becomes too nauseating and intense for me to withstand.</li>
            <li>Dior Homme Sport, normal Dior Homme</li>
            <li>Most glowing reviews of this product explained that you would only need one or two sprays and this product would &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; for quite a long time throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear unscented deodorant and usually make sure that any cologne I do wear does not end up on my bed, blanket, or pillows.</li>
            <li>Smells so good but not overwhelming and stays on!!!</li>
            <li>The scent of Intense will last all day.</li>
            <li>It is by far the strongest scent</li>
            <li>Usually only if we&#x27;re really &#x27;going out&#x27; to a crowded place or metro area</li>
            <li>Doesnt work for a masculine guy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Ordered from amazon directly without any issues.  </li>
            <li>cologne is not for the youngster teenagers or early college guys.</li>
            <li>The compliments that you&#x27;re going to receive, is definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Smell to me after dry down is more of a Hershey cocoa with powder....</li>
            <li>I love the dry down as well.</li>
            <li>I noticed this two hours after going to a bar last night, but to be sure, I asked a few of my friends that I was with if they can smell me, and they mentioned that they could smell me earlier but</li>
            <li>Fantastic cologne.. personal fav over the last few years.</li>

            <li> I am sure it smells better on other people</li>
            <li> and they are right</li>
            <li> WHICH IN MY OPINION IS THE RIGHT PRICE FOR THIS.</li>
            <li> tuxedo occasion that isa slightly less formal but still elegant and sophisticated event.</li>
            <li> oh the delivery was done very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where I live, this is a unique smell.</li>
            <li> so you more than likely wont smell like everyone else when you go out somewhere.</li>
            <li> Not sure where to start :) I love the way this EDP smells.  </li>
            <li> ; that is exactly what I get.</li>
            <li> one of the top perfumes to attrack opposite sexes.</li>
            <li> The sweetness has a small hint of powdery soap at the very top that keeps this parfum from being too sweet.</li>
            <li> Paid for Dior Homme Intense, but received Dior Homme!</li>
            <li> exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> First, purchasing cologne online is always risky--fakes are rampant.</li>
            <li> At first you smell the iris, lipstick-like scent but that soon becomes vanilla.</li>
            <li> I actually sprayed 4 to 5 times on my neck, and although the smell was great,  it died down pretty quickly within 2 hours....</li>
            <li> After the first 30-45 minutes it really opens up and becomes heavenly.</li>
            <li> After reviewing a lot of positive reviews on youtube and here on this scent, I was very eager to receive it and wear it.</li>
            <li> Well I must say, I have only had this on a short while, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> and now this Dior Homme Intense.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as intense as advertised.</li>
            <li> its too much for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Perfect cold weather scent for anybody.</li>
            <li> I understand liking for a perfume is very subjective</li>
            <li> This Parfum is not smell AT ALL like real Dior.</li>
            <li> Be ready for this as this is an all day parfum for men.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme Intense is a master piece.</li>
            <li> I dont like it much.</li>
            <li> Is very well blended.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t to say it isn&#x27;t intense, it is.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wear the EDP out on dates with my girlfriend, it&#x27;s strong though so not very frequently.</li>
            <li> I wont get into describing the fragrance much, you can find that info anywhere, but upon first impression, this is a winner and my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> Great iris opening and chocolate dry down.</li>
            <li> Very complex, sophisticated, and just overall nice.</li>
            <li> Even thought is says intense, it is missing the good parts of the regular DH.</li>
            <li> and in the less is more category.</li>
            <li> Warm, intense, complex, spicy vanilla.</li>
            <li> The first thing I thought of when I smelled it was an old rich woman that is single.</li>
            <li> The smell of it is very unique, slightly feminine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A high end scent without the high end price.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and find that any scent becomes too nauseating and intense for me to withstand.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme Sport, normal Dior Homme</li>
            <li> Most glowing reviews of this product explained that you would only need one or two sprays and this product would &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; for quite a long time throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear unscented deodorant and usually make sure that any cologne I do wear does not end up on my bed, blanket, or pillows.</li>
            <li> Smells so good but not overwhelming and stays on!!!</li>
            <li> The scent of Intense will last all day.</li>
            <li> It is by far the strongest scent</li>
            <li> Usually only if we&#x27;re really &#x27;going out&#x27; to a crowded place or metro area</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for a masculine guy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Ordered from amazon directly without any issues.  </li>
            <li> cologne is not for the youngster teenagers or early college guys.</li>
            <li> The compliments that you&#x27;re going to receive, is definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Smell to me after dry down is more of a Hershey cocoa with powder....</li>
            <li> I love the dry down as well.</li>
            <li> I noticed this two hours after going to a bar last night, but to be sure, I asked a few of my friends that I was with if they can smell me, and they mentioned that they could smell me earlier but</li>
            <li> Fantastic cologne.. personal fav over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know how to explain the transition from vanilla to this other note, but it is what makes this cologne masculine.</li>
            <li> This is flat and lacks the vibe.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> actually i&#x27;m like it ,but it&#x27;s took a long time</li>
            <li> Intense late on a Friday night and the Cologne arrived at my house on Monday.</li>
            <li> Besides it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with my skin since I do have other cologne that I wear that projects well throughout the day such as Lacoste Essentials that I bought in the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t stay for long time and its smell is a little bit different from the one I used to buy before.</li>
            <li> Iris opening with a cocoa dry down..fantastic!</li>
            <li> Those people will usually let you know how safe of a blind buy something is.</li>
            <li> I used to have a few kinds of cologne I&#x27;d wear to various outings, be it work or play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, zero regrets here.</li>
            <li> Its an eau de parfum but its very soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I would use it for any black tie/</li>
            <li> Bought it less than 9 months ago and already 80% gone.  </li>
            <li> Its a little on the dark side though and doesn&#x27;t come off as feminine, if you are looking for complements</li>
            <li> the scent invites one to come closer for a little sniff.</li>
            <li> but if you are a collector likes to change it up everyday, then go ahead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s definitely waste of money.</li>
            <li> The scent has a complicated aura that lingers in the air while it maintains a masculine scent close to the skin.</li>
            <li> This does not wear off in a few hours.</li>
            <li> should say I wear very little cologne.</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to find</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe this in a written review, but it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;sophisticated enough&amp;#34;, if it makes any sense.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this product in stores, and so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for years now and it is hard to find!</li>
            <li> Not a safe blind buy.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I want to say I recommend this all my friends and family, but I&#x27;m keeping this cologne a secret.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this fragrance after researching fragrances on sites like basenotes.com, to see what some fragrance heads would call a \\&quot;masterpiece\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> Granted, this was a blind buy for me</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy in the sense that I never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> This scent will drive your woman mad with desire and lust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed here.  </li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the great ones, I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> A very, very nice cologne. Woodsy, some spice... and in the less is more category. Had 4 compliments in one lunch hour, from ladies in their 20&#x27;s to 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Been using Dior Homme for several years now. Dior Homme Sport, normal Dior Homme and now this Dior Homme Intense. The scent of Intense will last all day. It is by far the strongest scent but it is not overwhelming. I don&#x27;t use it every day, just on special occasions or when I know that I will be around and about until the evening. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived at my house quickly! Smells great and lasts a long time! Iris opening with a cocoa dry down..fantastic! Itsca must buy!</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely delicious. compliments keep flying in. I love it! It smells as sexy as how the bottle looks.    oh the delivery was done very fast. Packaging was good. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The best product. Great service. Super price</li>
            <li> Great scent a must have in your collection.  Plenty of compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not sure if it&#x27;s authentic? Doesn&#x27;t seem as intense as advertised.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this fragrance after researching fragrances on sites like basenotes.com, to see what some fragrance heads would call a \\&quot;masterpiece\\&quot; scent. I wanted something that would be considered sexy and classy. Something that females would be attracted to and enjoy. This scent continuously came up, as well as a handful of others. Well I must say, I have only had this on a short while, but it smells amazing. Very complex, sophisticated, and just overall nice. A great scent!!! I wont get into describing the fragrance much, you can find that info anywhere, but upon first impression, this is a winner and my new signature scent. It is also hard to find so you more than likely wont smell like everyone else when you go out somewhere. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> good scent like a bit maybe cream or lipstick,,nice price</li>
            <li> I used to have a few kinds of cologne I&#x27;d wear to various outings, be it work or play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now wear Dior Homme (EDT) to work and around town. I sometimes wear the EDP out on dates with my girlfriend, it&#x27;s strong though so not very frequently. Usually only if we&#x27;re really &#x27;going out&#x27; to a crowded place or metro area and I want her to follow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I live, this is a unique smell. Most guys are wearing some crappy Aqua type smell that they put on in 7 sprays and is vomit inducing. This is warm, kind, and generally intoxicating. It&#x27;s icing on the cake. Two quick shots and you&#x27;re good. Real great for the first six to eight hours.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do.  This fragrance smells great and it lasts a long.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.  Go ahead, pull the trigger.</li>
            <li> This smells nice, but a bit overwhelming with chemical feel like im in a cloud of chemicals.. its too much for me. I am sure it smells better on other people but it doesnt work with my type, it feels too feminine for me like im wearing a lot of makeup kind of feel. I think it fits on women or very feminine men, it would smell amazing. Doesnt work for a masculine guy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a seven star product, I love it!! It smells amazing and lasts for hours. So sexy and elegant, will recommend for my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the pirchased of this product. The cologne smells amazing and it projects very good. Shipping was fast. I will be wearing this all the time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the perfumes I use for evening events. Warm, rich, deep and intimate the scent invites one to come closer for a little sniff. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to the supermarket or to work, it is more suited for dimmed lighting and sophisticated social events. The scent is &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; and warm and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on to go to the Opera or a Casino in Monaco. I would use it for any black tie/ tuxedo occasion that isa slightly less formal but still elegant and sophisticated event.</li>
            <li> I WILL KEEP THIS STOCKED!!!! One of the best in my collection!</li>
            <li> I placed my order for Dior Homme Intense late on a Friday night and the Cologne arrived at my house on Monday.What?? this hasn&#x27;t ever happened to me, i didn&#x27;t even know this was possible. Oh! and i got free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the Cologne, this is the highest quality Cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. Its an eau de parfum but its very soft and subtle.Perfect cold weather scent for anybody. Great Job Dior!!! Great Job Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this perfume before, but the one i bought now was completely different. The perfume doesn&#x27;t stay for long time and its smell is a little bit different from the one I used to buy before.</li>
            <li> Not sure where to start :) I love the way this EDP smells.  Ordered from amazon directly without any issues.  Projection and sillage (scent trail) are great.  I can still smell dior homme on clothes after 12 hours.  Smell to me after dry down is more of a Hershey cocoa with powder....a very clean smell</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever.  I have tried a few to see which one really works with my body chemistry.  This is the one.  I&#x27;ve tried D&amp;G, Burberry, Narisco Rodriguez, Prada and this one out does them all.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I understand liking for a perfume is very subjective blah blah blah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went by the reviews on Amazon and bought this. It appears what I received is genuine stuff. However, I am very disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;very nice&amp;#34;. It is hard to describe this in a written review, but it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;sophisticated enough&amp;#34;, if it makes any sense. Besides it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long. Moral of the story: Perfumes, like clothing must be tried out in person. True, you will spend 30% or even 40% more at the mall, but don&#x27;t go by online reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a good fragrance, very hyped. It depends on your taste. I like it but don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again when its finished. People say it smells like makeup and they are right; that is exactly what I get. If you are going to buy this to get attention based on all the hype it gets in reviews, don&#x27;t expect the fragrance to do all the work. A sweet smelling shabby looking guy still won&#x27;t get noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit pricey compared to some other great fragrances out there but if you are a collector likes to change it up everyday, then go ahead. Better yet, get a sample and see if you like it first.</li>
            <li> Warm, intense, complex, spicy vanilla. This smells fantastic. Women want to get close to you when you wear this. The longevity is pretty good, with notes detectable during midnight hanky panky from a 3 PM application. After the first 30-45 minutes it really opens up and becomes heavenly.</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE FOR ANY COLLECTION . SMELLS UNIQUE .BEHAVES MORE LIKE A NICHE AND NOT A DESIGNER . WOULD APPRECIATE IF ITS AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. I PURCHASED IT FOR 80 $ WHICH IN MY OPINION IS THE RIGHT PRICE FOR THIS.</li>
            <li> This is incredible, this smells amazing, just buy this the ladies love it. This is a must buy for any mans collection.</li>
            <li> Smells unique in every way,more to wear as a gentleman,more  for a pretty boy fits the profile for this cologne.I love it,and it is very potent.</li>
            <li> one of the top perfumes to attrack opposite sexes.</li>
            <li> I bought it I can not use it.This Parfum is not smell AT ALL like real Dior. it&#x27;s a fake. I&#x27;s definitely waste of money. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this smells....will continue to order this</li>
            <li> Doesnt meet the hype. It smells nasty.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cologne.. personal fav over the last few years. This one was big too! I need to get a travel sized one now.</li>
            <li> I have over 40 colognes in my collection, this is a top 5 for date nights.  I don&#x27;t love this smell but females do so I wear it.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Strong odor, and good for events.</li>
            <li> its is a different kind of cologne that I have not come across. A lot of people says that its smells like a macys/dillards cosmetic counter I can see that ...Its a little on the dark side though and doesn&#x27;t come off as feminine, if you are looking for complements then this gets you that but only if the person is close to you....not like attached to you but they have to be close to you...my only advise is buy this if you like to wear cologne not for others to smell it because you will be smelling it a lot on yourself and after 30 minutes when your nose stops picking it up you will be smelling your wrists or where ever you applied it...Its very addictive</li>
            <li> The opening is woodsy, settling with a powdery sweet scent. The sweetness has a small hint of powdery soap at the very top that keeps this parfum from being too sweet. Its not overpowering to push someone away. The scent has a complicated aura that lingers in the air while it maintains a masculine scent close to the skin. There&#x27;s no citrus smell with this parfum. You&#x27;ll always know its on you. Be ready for this as this is an all day parfum for men. This does not wear off in a few hours. You get what you pay for. Recommended with an A+!!</li>
            <li> Bottle came in original package and was in perfect condition!!!! Awesome smell and very unique. well worth the money to any mens cologne/parfume collection.</li>
            <li> Paid for Dior Homme Intense, but received Dior Homme! Would like what I paid for and not a lesser substitute!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic cologne!  Smells heavenly of vanilla and myrrh; reminds me of RenFest!!!  So many good feelings from the aroma and exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme Intense is a master piece. A well blended designer fragrance indeed with good silliage and longevity its a must-have for most.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Not a safe blind buy. Granted, this was a blind buy for me but I&#x27;m a risk taker anyway; I did a lot of research on the reformulation before I decided to risk my $95. It has great notes and there is a mild makeup/lipstick vibe in initial spray. However, this is pleasant to me. I love the dry down as well. I would always recommend people to check on Fragrantica and Basenotes before purchasing a fragrance they aren&#x27;t familiar with. Those people will usually let you know how safe of a blind buy something is. Is this worth the $100+ after shipping? Yes, zero regrets here.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb on my bf!!!!  Smells so good but not overwhelming and stays on!!!</li>
            <li> Seductive and inviting scent that every woman loves.  A compliment getter. Awesome and will keep a bottle in my cologne arsenal.</li>
            <li> After reviewing a lot of positive reviews on youtube and here on this scent, I was very eager to receive it and wear it. Ultimately I was disappointed. I did not have a \\&quot;whoah\\&quot; moment at anytime. The first thing I thought of when I smelled it was an old rich woman that is single. I dont know why, but that is what this smell reminds me of. Also it gave me a headache after about an hour. I think its the scent of lipstick that lingers around you, that seems to be the strongest scent I pick up on unless i put my nose to my skin and smell. Its just not what I thought it would be. I dont like it much. Seller was great though.</li>
            <li> This EDP is enticing and definitely worth obtaining even if you have the EDT....I would say the EDT is better for office setting; but EDP is really much better for clubbing or date night.  This scent will drive your woman mad with desire and lust.</li>
            <li> Bought it less than 9 months ago and already 80% gone.  I love this one - my signature scent.  People should know that you can&#x27;t otherwise buy this at a store since this formulation is not sold/packaged for the US Market.  So it&#x27;s even better that someone can buy it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the regular Dior Homme, Beware.  Even thought is says intense, it is missing the good parts of the regular DH. This is flat and lacks the vibe. Really disappointed here.  I would not recommend this at all, couldn&#x27;t imagine what they were thinking.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very classy! Long lasting. Works well in cool weather. Is very well blended. A high end scent without the high end price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.Excellent seller.Thanks....A++++++++++</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for years now and it is hard to find! i love how delicious it smells and how much compliments i get. it also lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is not for the youngster teenagers or early college guys. i think it is more for the 25+ crowd</li>
            <li> Love this scent and it smells great on my husband. This is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve purchased for him; it&#x27;s one of his favorites!</li>
            <li> The compliments that you&#x27;re going to receive, is definitely worth the money spent. I&#x27;ve already recommended this fragrance to a friend, and I plan on purchasing  another bottle for myself. If you need a second opinion, check out the reviews on YouTube!</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I have owned and is now my go to scent.  Numerous girls (&amp;#62;5) have commended me on how nice I smell :)</li>
            <li> actually i&#x27;m like it ,but it&#x27;s took a long time a upon a arrived . that&#x27;s set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mr . omar</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this product in stores, and so I turned to Amazon. Most glowing reviews of this product explained that you would only need one or two sprays and this product would &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; for quite a long time throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not the case for me. I actually sprayed 4 to 5 times on my neck, and although the smell was great,  it died down pretty quickly within 2 hours.... I noticed this two hours after going to a bar last night, but to be sure, I asked a few of my friends that I was with if they can smell me, and they mentioned that they could smell me earlier but couldn&#x27;t 3 hours later when I asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to work today. Sprayed 6 times. The same thing happened..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with my skin since I do have other cologne that I wear that projects well throughout the day such as Lacoste Essentials that I bought in the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is a problem with the brand, it is more of an Amazon issue; they are selling old colognes that are on the verge of being obsolete.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! Excellent projection and longevity on me. Great iris opening and chocolate dry down. I wish i could wear this more often as i see this only fitting for certain occassions.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Great scent, highly recommended</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy in the sense that I never smelled it before. My purchase was dictated by what I read on forums (basenotes) and these reviews. First, purchasing cologne online is always risky--fakes are rampant. The cologne I received was a genuine DHI with a batch code corresponding to July 2014. The formulations for 2013 and 2014 don&#x27;t seem, according to websites, to have gone through any noticeable reformulations. Now to review the actual smell of the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to wear this in public, perhaps I will update when I do. The smell of it is very unique, slightly feminine. At first you smell the iris, lipstick-like scent but that soon becomes vanilla. You linger on the vanilla for a while and then you notice hints of some sort of wood. I don&#x27;t quite know how to explain the transition from vanilla to this other note, but it is what makes this cologne masculine. It&#x27;s elusive to description and even more so to the nose. You want another whiff, as if it were a mystery to be solved. I found my nose stuck to my wrist where I had sprayed it trying to figuring it out and then just enjoying the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say I wear very little cologne. I have a sensitive nose and find that any scent becomes too nauseating and intense for me to withstand. I wear unscented deodorant and usually make sure that any cologne I do wear does not end up on my bed, blanket, or pillows. That being said, I had no qualms about letting this cologne get on my personal belongings. Which isn&#x27;t to say it isn&#x27;t intense, it is. But it&#x27;s delightful. I want to say I recommend this all my friends and family, but I&#x27;m keeping this cologne a secret.</li>
