            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it just like Bath and Body Works to discontinue a great scent?</li>

            <li>My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>We love the Oak Bath and Body Wash/Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great masculine, woody + musk smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good and my wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I contacted amazon support and they were able to refund my $ right away.</li>
            <li>I got my order super quick!</li>
            <li>He was excited.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent!</li>
            <li>As long as Amazon carries it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This product works well as a body wash (and can be used as a shampoo, although I don&#x27;t use it that way by preference), and has a nice masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent.</li>

            <li>It was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Lotion quality is reasonable, although the scent is stronger than with the body wash.</li>
            <li>It may come across on the strong side in the shower, but the scent fades quickly afterwards, and of course you can always use less of it per wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to other people to experience the scent of a grown and sexy man.</li>
            <li>Very masculine smell.</li>

            <li> I have to speculate that the sales of &amp;#34;Oak&amp;#34; were not great, however of the three initial &amp;#34;men&#x27;s line&amp;#34; releases, this somewhat musky, wood scent has been my favourite, as well as drawn a multitude of praise from the passer by ;)</li>

            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash my husband has ever been crazy about.  We couldn&#x27;t believe it was unavailble now from Bath and Body Works.  According to the girls in our store, there are many unhappy people that this scent was dropped.  Very happy that we found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells good and fresh.  I would recommend it to other people to experience the scent of a grown and sexy man.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff and now it&#x27;s discontinued. He&#x27;s going to be stoked when he finds out he&#x27;s getting some for christmas! I got my order super quick!</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers are reporting that this is a discontinued product.  I hope not.  This product works well as a body wash (and can be used as a shampoo, although I don&#x27;t use it that way by preference), and has a nice masculine scent.  It may come across on the strong side in the shower, but the scent fades quickly afterwards, and of course you can always use less of it per wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, my wife likes it.  Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, if you like the scent, Bath and BodyWorks also has similarly scented lotion (Oak for men body lotion).  Lotion quality is reasonable, although the scent is stronger than with the body wash.</li>
            <li> The product works well for me and I&#x27;m happy to have found it on Amazon. It was discontinued by Bath and Body.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent, and it has been discontinued; surprised him with it for his birthday.  He was excited.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash. It&#x27;s so hard to find and now people are selling whats left for a fortune. I wish Bath and Body works would bring this product back</li>
            <li> So upset Bath &amp; Body Works got rid of this scent.  It was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and says it leaves a fresh feeling on the body and the shampoo is also great.</li>
            <li> Great masculine, woody + musk smell. Fresh scent! Your woman will be all over you with this. Unfortunately when I received the product, it was leaking badly. I contacted amazon support and they were able to refund my $ right away.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Oak&amp;#34; and received &amp;#34;Citron&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> GREAT shampoos and smells good too!!!</li>
            <li> We love the Oak Bath and Body Wash/Shampoo.  It takes a very little amount of product.  You smell good and the bathroom smells good!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it just like Bath and Body Works to discontinue a great scent? I have to speculate that the sales of &amp;#34;Oak&amp;#34; were not great, however of the three initial &amp;#34;men&#x27;s line&amp;#34; releases, this somewhat musky, wood scent has been my favourite, as well as drawn a multitude of praise from the passer by ;)</li>
            <li> Very masculine smell. Hate that Bath and Body Works has discontinued this product. If you want it, you now have to order it online, which is what I did. Get &#x27;em while you can, gentlemen.. this is a dying breed, but the best smelling stuff on the market for a manly man. The ladies like it too....</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent. It seems as though B&amp;BW doesn&#x27;t have this in their stores anymore. I don&#x27;t know why that is. This stuff smells really good and my wife absolutely loves it. As long as Amazon carries it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
