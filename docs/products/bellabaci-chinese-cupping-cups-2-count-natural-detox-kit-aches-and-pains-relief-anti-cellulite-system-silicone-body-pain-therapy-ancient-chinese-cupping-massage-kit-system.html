            <li>These cups are the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me!!</li>
            <li>So happy!!!</li>
            <li>The suction on these cups is great!</li>
            <li>Best cups !  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>If anything it just feels really good to use the cups.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it has been amazing using these cups on my legs.</li>
            <li>But foer each its own</li>
            <li>If I use them in the shower, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting tons of water and shower gel - it takes FOREVER, and you need a lot of product (you have to use some kind of gel or oil to help the cup glide over your skin, and since the water keeps rinsing it away, you have to keep adding more).</li>
            <li>Combined with healthy eating and excercise</li>
            <li>They work great and seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that within another 2 months my thighs will look absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>but it really feels good and relaxed</li>
            <li>but you can easily tell when the cup needs to be moved preventing any &amp;#34;cup kisses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I must have very very stubborn fat!!</li>
            <li>With this price and all great preview, I expected much better.</li>
            <li>AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH LEMONGRASS OIL (which has great skin firming properties against cellulite) mixed with ALMOND OIL.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I would have seen some reduction in my mild cellulite if I used them longer, but here&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, primarily because I dropped fifty bucks on them, but also because you can use them on the back of the neck (feels quite nice) or on the stomach to aid digestion.</li>
            <li>These BellaBaci body cups REALLY WORK!!  </li>
            <li>I am using it since I got it, and no sign of success.</li>
            <li>right after you do a session on each leg and thigh.</li>
            <li>in just a few days I have started to see results and the reduction in the cellulite in my thighs has been amazing!  </li>
            <li>would definitely recommend these cups to any woman having cellulite problems, they&#x27;re great not only at reducing cellulite and breaking the fat and stimulating the lymphatic system</li>
            <li>After consistent use, it is helping.</li>
            <li>They did nothing positive for my skin tone/texture and in fact they bruised my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to give reviews that aim to please anyone just for the sake of it because I&#x27;m very particular about the results I get from a product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>being 41, having 3 kids and gaining then losing a lot of baby weight, my cellulite was very unattractive to look at.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>I STARTED USING THEM SINCE THE VERY 1ST.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6weeks and nothing if not worse..</li>
            <li>I have also used them for massage on stiff back muscles and they are great for that too.</li>
            <li>There are cheaper ones available but reviews say they don&#x27;t have as much suction and don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The key is to be consistent.</li>
            <li>The cups are made with quality materials and the instuctions are clear.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve worn long pants for years even in the hot summer.</li>
            <li>We were surprised  to find them on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had come with 2 soft cups.</li>
            <li>But now thanks to BellaBaci body cups I can now wear shorts for the 1st time in a long time this summer.</li>
            <li>Cups arrived fast, no reduction  in cellulite  but does help with achy muscles  after a long workout.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but it does appear to be toning some trouble spots on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li>If only I had come across these body cups before and would had NEVER  spent so much money on pricey lotions that promise to reduce cellulite that give NO RESULTS and the only thing they reduce is your pocket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use them everyday at work on my clients and on myself, not only can you get just the right suction</li>

            <li> I use them everyday at work on my clients and on myself, not only can you get just the right suction</li>
            <li> In the past, I dry brushed diligently for about a month and did see SOME positive results, so I&#x27;m staying with that instead.</li>
            <li> (I used them on my neck once but left them in place too long</li>
            <li> The quality of the silicone makes them durable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, those veins have almost totally faded after I returned to dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I prefer dry brushing along with diet and exercise to get rid of my cellulite</li>

            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I really do not believe it will work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm and my cellulite is finally going away.</li>
            <li> Not cool.)  </li>
            <li> If you use it outside of the shower, you need to grease yourself up with oil and spend a long time half-naked contorting yourself into uncomfortable positions.</li>
            <li> It not worth it!</li>
            <li> Started using them about a month ago everyday diligently in the shower and guess what?</li>
            <li> I suggest watching a few videos</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of cupping, a few small spidery-looking veins started appearing on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad cellulite in my thighs for yrs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I recommend this product based on my results.</li>
            <li> I feel a lot less weird and messy brushing for a few minutes than greasing myself up like a cake pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never use the hard cup. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> My cellulite which was pretty bad, is now almost unnoticeable!</li>
            <li> Getting more disappointed every day. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too messy and weird to continue doing for no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While they do seem to make the skin tingly and increase circulation, they&#x27;re time-consuming and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed .</li>
            <li> Seriously!!</li>
            <li> I hated to show my legs.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it! Amazing results.</li>
            <li> These cups are the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me!! Started using them about a month ago everyday diligently in the shower and guess what? My cellulite which was pretty bad, is now almost unnoticeable! Seriously!! I&#x27;m not one to give reviews that aim to please anyone just for the sake of it because I&#x27;m very particular about the results I get from a product. But when I tell you these cups get the job done, trust me they do! I had pretty bad cellulite in my thighs for yrs. being 41, having 3 kids and gaining then losing a lot of baby weight, my cellulite was very unattractive to look at. So I&#x27;ve worn long pants for years even in the hot summer. I hated to show my legs. But now thanks to BellaBaci body cups I can now wear shorts for the 1st time in a long time this summer. Combined with healthy eating and excercise I&#x27;m sure that within another 2 months my thighs will look absolutely fabulous. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using them daily as I have a goal that I&#x27;m trying to reach with my thighs. I definitely recommend and if I ever need to reorder I will do that. So happy!!!</li>
            <li> This works really well. It has helped me with some health issues such as clogged lymph issues. I feel that it also helps the skin in that it may increase the circulation. The suction on these cups is great!</li>
            <li> These BellaBaci body cups REALLY WORK!!  I STARTED USING THEM SINCE THE VERY 1ST. DAY I RECEIVED ON ON 5/29/15 AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH LEMONGRASS OIL (which has great skin firming properties against cellulite) mixed with ALMOND OIL.  WOW! in just a few days I have started to see results and the reduction in the cellulite in my thighs has been amazing!  If only I had come across these body cups before and would had NEVER  spent so much money on pricey lotions that promise to reduce cellulite that give NO RESULTS and the only thing they reduce is your pocket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these cups to any woman having cellulite problems, they&#x27;re great not only at reducing cellulite and breaking the fat and stimulating the lymphatic system but it really feels good and relaxed right after you do a session on each leg and thigh.</li>
            <li> I bought these to do at home cellulite treatments on my thighs. After consistent use, it is helping. I noticed a difference after the third time. The key is to be consistent. I use them everyday prior to my shower and I use them with coconut oil. I have also used them for massage on stiff back muscles and they are great for that too. I suggest watching a few videos so you have some idea of what you&#x27;re doing. They do leave suction marks if you aren&#x27;t careful and depending on how long you leave them in place. For cellulite massage, I move them constantly. The slower you move them, the deeper they are working. (I used them on my neck once but left them in place too long so I ended up looking like I had hickies. Not cool.)  The quality of the silicone makes them durable and long lasting. There are cheaper ones available but reviews say they don&#x27;t have as much suction and don&#x27;t last as long.  Would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Best cups !  I use them everyday at work on my clients and on myself, not only can you get just the right suction but you can easily tell when the cup needs to be moved preventing any &amp;#34;cup kisses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My wife discovered these cups from a massage therapist when she was having back problems.  We were surprised  to find them on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  They work great and seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now.  I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but it does appear to be toning some trouble spots on my upper thighs.  If anything it just feels really good to use the cups.  I plan on using them to ease headaches and neck tension soon, too.</li>
            <li> Lots of extra work trying to make the cups work properly. I prefer dry brushing along with diet and exercise to get rid of my cellulite</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It not worth it! I am using this for 2 months and I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> did not work, left my body bruised and frankly in pain…. i don;t think this is what the product is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Bought these for a client cellulite treatment... they work like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used these faithfully for about three weeks. Maybe I would have seen some reduction in my mild cellulite if I used them longer, but here&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they do seem to make the skin tingly and increase circulation, they&#x27;re time-consuming and difficult to use. If I use them in the shower, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting tons of water and shower gel - it takes FOREVER, and you need a lot of product (you have to use some kind of gel or oil to help the cup glide over your skin, and since the water keeps rinsing it away, you have to keep adding more). If you use it outside of the shower, you need to grease yourself up with oil and spend a long time half-naked contorting yourself into uncomfortable positions. It&#x27;s too messy and weird to continue doing for no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND...after a few weeks of cupping, a few small spidery-looking veins started appearing on my thighs. NOPE. Never had those before. I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, those veins have almost totally faded after I returned to dry brushing. In the past, I dry brushed diligently for about a month and did see SOME positive results, so I&#x27;m staying with that instead. I feel a lot less weird and messy brushing for a few minutes than greasing myself up like a cake pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping these around because...well, primarily because I dropped fifty bucks on them, but also because you can use them on the back of the neck (feels quite nice) or on the stomach to aid digestion.</li>
            <li> waste of money, very dissappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6weeks and nothing if not worse..Getting more disappointed every day. :(</li>
            <li> I was not impressed . With this price and all great preview, I expected much better. Not working out for me. But foer each its own</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks but I find it soothing and heating. The cups are made with quality materials and the instuctions are clear. I also used their Youtube website to get visuals on how to use the cups.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference at all on spider veins. I really do not believe it will work. I am using it since I got it, and no sign of success.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had come with 2 soft cups. I never use the hard cup. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it has been amazing using these cups on my legs. In a week, I could noticed a difference on my skin. It&#x27;s firm and my cellulite is finally going away.</li>
            <li> They are nice...been doing it for 2 wks now.</li>
            <li> Cups arrived fast, no reduction  in cellulite  but does help with achy muscles  after a long workout.</li>
            <li> Although, these are packaged in a really cute box, they are completely useless.  They did nothing positive for my skin tone/texture and in fact they bruised my skin.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any results and have been using this product now for 2 months. Not sure if I recommend this product based on my results. I must have very very stubborn fat!!</li>
