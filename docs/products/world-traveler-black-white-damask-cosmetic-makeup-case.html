            <li>I was very concerned about the measurements of this bag and it turned out to be smaller when I received it than what was advertised.</li>
            <li>way too small and cheap for the price paid</li>

            <li> The size is great.  It fits so much in this little bag. Perfect way to keep it all together.  I use it to gather little items, not even makeup and it matches my 31 Tote Bag perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Very cute bought two of these one for my daughter and myself love the print on these it is basic small enough to take on vacations or just to use to store your cosmetics my daughter loves hers perfect for gifts for friends or family.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use it as a nail polish bag. The design is stunning! There is a lot of space for something that is considered \\&quot;small\\&quot;. The only critique would the smell that the bag gives off. The smell goes away if you let it air-out.</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly what I expected. I love it. I am glad I bought it despite the reviews that the product smelled poorly. My bag has no scent or smell at all. I would recommend this bag in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> Excellent very beautifull súper nice case i lime very much, great gift for a apreciar person lime a friend for special</li>
            <li> Bag was smaller than I expected but it still works for the purpose that I bought it</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size and was purchased to match a few other items.  It was a hit and would recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than i wanted</li>
            <li> Inside the bag I found a label saying that the materials used in the item can cause diseases in fetus. Obviously, I sent it back. Especially that I was pregnant at that moment. I think that buyers should indicate such information.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend and it is the perfect size for your daily makeup.  Not big enough to store ALL your cleansing and skin care stuff...but perfect for the makeup.  Seems well built and sturdy too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this! I use it every day for my make up, good price, great quality, cute print would purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this matching piece to my growing collection of Damask print bags. Just enough space for your every day cosmetics and face creams for an overnight or weekend trip. High Five on this one.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about the measurements of this bag and it turned out to be smaller when I received it than what was advertised. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to match my luggage.  I had read the details on the size of the product, but it seems much smaller.  To get an idea, this bag only fits what I would consider your \\&quot;daily cosmetics.\\&quot;  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you were planning on packing toiletries.  For the price, you could get a much larger case at any local retailer.</li>
            <li> I had special request that the cases come gift wrapped and they did not. I was unsure if it was going to be fabric or plastic and surprise, surprise it was actual fabric. This is the cheapest thing I saw for cosmetic cases. It is small and ideal as a bridesmaids gift. I bought five and they are all exactly the same size and everything.</li>
            <li> Not as big as i thought but still a good bag</li>
            <li> This item is much smaller then I had expected. the seller did great, it got here in a very timely manner.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you are looking for something small. I have alot of make up and was expecting this to be able to hold it.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling, matches the set I purchased on Amazon as well!!</li>
            <li> i got this very quick , transfered all my make up in here and it just works fantastic ! i recommend you buying if you need a small pouch or bag for your make up to carry around(:</li>
            <li> I order this makeup case and I received a small 7 day pill box instead. I couldn&#x27;t just return the pill box and get the makeup case in return, so I had to either keep the pill box or return it and get my money back. I wasn&#x27;t at all happy with the mistake or the remedy.</li>
            <li> super cute and holds alot of make up :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, and she really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in time, and your service was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> way too small and cheap for the price paid</li>
            <li> This too a long time to get to me, but it was worth it. For the price, its a steal. The print is great, the white is really white so be careful not to get makeup on it, and it holds a ton in my opinion, though I don&#x27;t have that much makeup. Cute enough that I bring it with me when I travel and I&#x27;ll just leave it out on my dresser. Good product</li>
            <li> Got this for  my grand daughter she loves it......great price very well made</li>
            <li> This bag is smaller than I expected, but cute and fashionable, with plenty of room for things like eyeshadow and mineral makeup.</li>
