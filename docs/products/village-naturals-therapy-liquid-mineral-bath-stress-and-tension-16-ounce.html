            <li>, it smells more like juniper &amp; orange than Menthol.  </li>
            <li>It is not as refreshing as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>I was looking to something more comparable to a Bath &amp; Body Works that I once had</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it on amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this as well as the Aches &amp; Pains one.</li>

            <li>Smells great and really does relax and help me sleep at night.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one is the best; more bubbles and a nice clean</li>
            <li>The smell is perfect and absolutely not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I find the scent to be absolutely overpowering, but that can be good as well.</li>
            <li>I have used better bath oils before, but this is a good one as far as aromatherapy goes.</li>

            <li>after working all day its real nice to get in a warm bath with this product.it takes very little and foam up</li>
            <li>all the products from this company \\&quot;village naturals\\&quot; are fine products</li>
            <li>Especially now in summer, since it is so hot, and I&#x27;m sweating all the time, this is excellent to use while you&#x27;re taking a shower as it will help cover up any body odor.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite bubble baths!</li>
            <li>also thank u so much for this kind of soap.</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot, my body feels very relaxed when I bathe with this.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>stuff smells great hours later...</li>
            <li>but I honestly think the combination really mellowed me out.</li>
            <li>RELAX ENJOY GO FOR THE GOLD</li>
            <li>No this stuff is not bath and body, because actually it&#x27;s naturally derived and enriched with vitamins and minerals that are good and beneficial for your body.</li>
            <li>Most bubble baths seem to dissipate quickly, I find it very refreshing to that there is a product that is able to last so long and smell so good.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I use as body wash and leave my entire body completely relaxed.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who enjoys unwinding with a warm and relaxing bath :)</li>
            <li>It seemed like a mild product which was fine, but I really need the more in my face smell to help with sinus and allergy issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is going to be great, as usual, but what I got isn&#x27;t what is advertised.</li>
            <li>You have to use a good portion for it to actually smell.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really contours with stress and tension.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and it really does seem to relieve stress and tention.</li>
            <li>This truly is, in the words of The Bard, \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s sweet restorer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this hot bath soap, really helps relax and easy achy muscles and prepare for bed.</li>
            <li>Good thick rich bubbles with a nice uplifting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>All of the other Village Naturals are great products</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff at Walmart last year and it is amazing how great this will make you feel after a long and ahrd day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a mild soapy smell with some menthol.</li>
            <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t turn your bath jets on too high or</li>
            <li>I have found other much cheaper products that give just as good bubbles, better and stronger scent and don&#x27;t leave me feeling oily afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is Very Bubbly and it Doesn&#x27;t have the strong vicks smell</li>
            <li>These bubbles smell great, leave your skin smooth and soft, and help relax you after a long day.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting her more!</li>
            <li>I like to get the whole tub filled with bubbles , then just smear them all over my chest and face , to where I&#x27;m enveloped and I can feel and hear the bubbles popping and fizzing around my head...</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a very invigorating blend and is sure to refresh you completely.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it whenever he needs to soak in a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Overall I will use this again and am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It created a ton of bubbles and make my skin feel soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Deep Steep brand for now that costs more</li>
            <li>Just make sure you lock the bathroom door and plan on an hour of just personal time.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I would love it if you had a lotion or perfume in the same scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big bubble bath enthusiast and this product has good bubbles, nice scent and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I dont know exactly how much stress and tension any product like this relieves.</li>
            <li>True to its description of being natural.</li>
            <li>nice, relaxing smell, decent bubbles, not much needed.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to pick me up when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to unwind and relax.  </li>
            <li>Im really into aroma therapy</li>
            <li>and this stuff doesn&#x27;t really cut it.</li>
            <li>Really helps her relax in the tub.</li>
            <li>This came In the mail fast and with no breakage of the bottles.</li>
            <li>The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great, and last for the entire bath.</li>
            <li>REALLY???  </li>
            <li>Although it doesnt really say much about it, this is a bubble bath and boy</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Really, what can I say?  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I decided I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing really oily about it</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really soften my skin.</li>
            <li>I really Like how this product works.  </li>
            <li>Even just sniffing the bottle without taking a bath is really relaxing.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops makes a nice sudsy wash that feels relaxing and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>so it keeps my skin from becoming dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li>, if you turn the bottle upside down and then rightside up you can just see all these bubbles rush to the top...</li>
            <li>Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell of these items, I found that in order to get enough of the aroma for it to actually be relaxing you have to dump in nearly a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li>When I take a bath and am finished I normally just wish to towel off and go on my way, not have to take a shower to wash the oily feeling off after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she has no complaint regarding the product.</li>
            <li>But I guarantee you, if you fill the tub for her, then wash her back and rub her shoulders a bit, it will do the trick and put a smile on her face.</li>
            <li>This is really nice for a day that has been stressful and makes you feel all tense.  </li>
            <li>This is the first bubble bath that I&#x27;ve used in which the bubbles LAST.</li>
            <li>Village Company please pay attention, if you are going to make a bubble bath and try to trick people by using the word NATURAL in it, then do us all a favor and take out the toxins.  </li>
            <li>The smell is relaxing &amp; your skin is SO soft after soaking in this.</li>
            <li>Natural and soothing essence feels like heaven.</li>
            <li>Use it as a soft soap in the shower, or as bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing again , I was pleasently surprised...</li>
            <li>Whenever I am feeling down and under the weather I always feel uplifted when I take a hot bath with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell that I have it in my bath other than the bubbles it creates.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a lot more back pain and just feeling bad in general... wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this stuff</li>

            <li> I like to get the whole tub filled with bubbles , then just smear them all over my chest and face , to where I&#x27;m enveloped and I can feel and hear the bubbles popping and fizzing around my head...</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a very invigorating blend and is sure to refresh you completely.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it whenever he needs to soak in a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Overall I will use this again and am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It created a ton of bubbles and make my skin feel soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the Deep Steep brand for now that costs more</li>
            <li> Just make sure you lock the bathroom door and plan on an hour of just personal time.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I would love it if you had a lotion or perfume in the same scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big bubble bath enthusiast and this product has good bubbles, nice scent and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I dont know exactly how much stress and tension any product like this relieves.</li>
            <li> True to its description of being natural.</li>
            <li> nice, relaxing smell, decent bubbles, not much needed.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to pick me up when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to unwind and relax.  </li>
            <li> Im really into aroma therapy</li>
            <li> and this stuff doesn&#x27;t really cut it.</li>
            <li> Really helps her relax in the tub.</li>
            <li> This came In the mail fast and with no breakage of the bottles.</li>
            <li> The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great, and last for the entire bath.</li>
            <li> REALLY???  </li>
            <li> Although it doesnt really say much about it, this is a bubble bath and boy</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Really, what can I say?  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I decided I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing really oily about it</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really soften my skin.</li>
            <li> I really Like how this product works.  </li>
            <li> Even just sniffing the bottle without taking a bath is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops makes a nice sudsy wash that feels relaxing and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> so it keeps my skin from becoming dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li> , if you turn the bottle upside down and then rightside up you can just see all these bubbles rush to the top...</li>
            <li> Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> While I love the smell of these items, I found that in order to get enough of the aroma for it to actually be relaxing you have to dump in nearly a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li> When I take a bath and am finished I normally just wish to towel off and go on my way, not have to take a shower to wash the oily feeling off after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she has no complaint regarding the product.</li>
            <li> But I guarantee you, if you fill the tub for her, then wash her back and rub her shoulders a bit, it will do the trick and put a smile on her face.</li>
            <li> This is really nice for a day that has been stressful and makes you feel all tense.  </li>
            <li> This is the first bubble bath that I&#x27;ve used in which the bubbles LAST.</li>
            <li> Village Company please pay attention, if you are going to make a bubble bath and try to trick people by using the word NATURAL in it, then do us all a favor and take out the toxins.  </li>
            <li> The smell is relaxing &amp; your skin is SO soft after soaking in this.</li>
            <li> Natural and soothing essence feels like heaven.</li>
            <li> Use it as a soft soap in the shower, or as bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing again , I was pleasently surprised...</li>
            <li> Whenever I am feeling down and under the weather I always feel uplifted when I take a hot bath with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell that I have it in my bath other than the bubbles it creates.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot more back pain and just feeling bad in general... wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many bubble bath products that I can smell for a long time when using them, but sadly this one does not hold up to the test.</li>
            <li> I like using it after a long day or even in the middle of the day after working out to relieve my muscles</li>
            <li> The bubbles last a long time too!</li>
            <li> I have looked for this product for a long time</li>
            <li> Females especially need to be careful what they expose their bodies to.  </li>
            <li> I even take a little &amp; mix this in with my regular shower cream for a little extra boost &amp; my skin is also soft from just the little bit used.</li>
            <li> The Cold and Allergy one does have a strong Menthol smell to it, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  </li>
            <li> &gt; The only thing I can suggest is throw this thing in a ziplock bag or something because it does leak a LITTLE bit , but it wasnt an issue in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes shower floor a bit oily be careful.</li>
            <li> If you do not unless you have little to no water in your tub the scent will be almost non existent.</li>
            <li> The other reason it is receiving 3 stars is because even with a small amount this product tends to leave an almost oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I opened this package to find a bottle with a broken cap and blue goo all over the inside of the packaging.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was just the xanax or this</li>
            <li> as I age into my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t relieve my tension at all since the scent is so overpowering, but if you&#x27;re someone who suffers from body odor because you sweat a lot, I would definitely recommend giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small bottle too!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a bad product yet.</li>
            <li> I also like the allergy and cold ones too!</li>
            <li> I personally hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just a few drops makes a nice sudsy wash that feels relaxing and cleansing.  Bathing is a delight with it.</li>
            <li> Good thick rich bubbles with a nice uplifting fragrance.  It really does seem to pick me up when I use it.  I like it.</li>
            <li> While I love the smell of these items, I found that in order to get enough of the aroma for it to actually be relaxing you have to dump in nearly a quarter of the bottle. If you do not unless you have little to no water in your tub the scent will be almost non existent. The other reason it is receiving 3 stars is because even with a small amount this product tends to leave an almost oily residue on your skin. Some people seem to like it I personally hate it. When I take a bath and am finished I normally just wish to towel off and go on my way, not have to take a shower to wash the oily feeling off after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I adore the smell, especially the aches and pains one.. I have found other much cheaper products that give just as good bubbles, better and stronger scent and don&#x27;t leave me feeling oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice smell and seems to serve as a catalyst for relaxation.  My husband uses it whenever he needs to soak in a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!! the aroma is not overpowering, and it really is relaxing.. loved my bath!</li>
            <li> I tried the Village Naturals Cold and Allergy months ago, and I really liked this stuff.  Whenever I am feeling down and under the weather I always feel uplifted when I take a hot bath with this stuff.  The Cold and Allergy one does have a strong Menthol smell to it, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  Now this Stress &amp; Tension Foaming Bath Oil is equally great.  It is Very Bubbly and it Doesn&#x27;t have the strong vicks smell, it smells more like juniper &amp; orange than Menthol.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to unwind and relax.  No this stuff is not bath and body, because actually it&#x27;s naturally derived and enriched with vitamins and minerals that are good and beneficial for your body.</li>
            <li> Im really into aroma therapy and this stuff doesn&#x27;t really cut it. You have to use a good portion for it to actually smell. The smell is a mild soapy smell with some menthol. I dont think this \\&quot;stress and tention\\&quot; stuff is any different than the \\&quot;restless nights\\&quot; purple one.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this product. Really helps her relax in the tub.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this hot bath soap, really helps relax and easy achy muscles and prepare for bed.</li>
            <li> Great smell, lots of bubbles</li>
            <li> This came In the mail fast and with no breakage of the bottles. Loved the smell. Used as a bubble bath and it gave me lots of bubbles. Overall I will use this again and am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would. It is not as refreshing as I would have hoped. I was looking to something more comparable to a Bath &amp; Body Works that I once had - this smells more like Grandma&#x27;s House!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying bubble baths since I was a teenager, and this product surprised me. I love it! The scent makes me feel physically rejuvenated and the bubbles are great, and last for the entire bath. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The scent of this bubbling bath oil was very pleasant, and it did indeed make me feel very relaxed! It created a ton of bubbles and make my skin feel soft and smooth afterward. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> after working all day its real nice to get in a warm bath with this product.it takes very little and foam up so good I have looked for this product for a long time I was so pleased to find it on amazon thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice bath oil.  I have used better bath oils before, but this is a good one as far as aromatherapy goes.</li>
            <li> These bubbles smell great, leave your skin smooth and soft, and help relax you after a long day. I recommend them to anyone who loves a good bath at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> well bec the soap is good for me while n bath and love it smell good also thank u so much for this kind of soap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product.  The name sounds good and it smells good, but then I read the ingredients.  Village Company please pay attention, if you are going to make a bubble bath and try to trick people by using the word NATURAL in it, then do us all a favor and take out the toxins.  Propylene Glycol and parabens?  REALLY???  And what&#x27;s with the dyes? Blue 1, Red 33, Yellow 6 ... and you want me to soak my body in this?  Females especially need to be careful what they expose their bodies to.  This could have been a great product.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Deep Steep brand for now that costs more but that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> If you like to take baths this stuff will not disappoint you!  The bubbles last a long time too!</li>
            <li> nice, relaxing smell, decent bubbles, not much needed. all the products from this company \\&quot;village naturals\\&quot; are fine products</li>
            <li> It seemed like a mild product which was fine, but I really need the more in my face smell to help with sinus and allergy issues.  But I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this as well as the Aches &amp; Pains one. This does target the tension in my lower back, shoulders, &amp; neck. The smell is relaxing &amp; your skin is SO soft after soaking in this. I even take a little &amp; mix this in with my regular shower cream for a little extra boost &amp; my skin is also soft from just the little bit used. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I use as body wash and leave my entire body completely relaxed.The menthol penetrate in your skin and you fell relivied all stress.I Highly recommend. A++++++++++</li>
            <li> Nice product, Produces mountains of foaming bubbles when used in a Jacuzzi tub.  We over did it and needed a periscope.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. True to its description of being natural. Natural and soothing essence feels like heaven. Amazing product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Came in before the estimated shipment delivery. The product was sealed and handled with love. I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really contours with stress and tension. Although it doesnt really say much about it, this is a bubble bath and boy do you get bubbles so make sure you don&#x27;t turn your bath jets on too high or you&#x27;re going to be in for a treat haha</li>
            <li> It wasnt very potent like I would have liked and ive seen cheaper brands with more spunk! Small bottle too!</li>
            <li> This is really nice for a day that has been stressful and makes you feel all tense.  This soak helps you take it all away.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift so I don&#x27;t know if it was good for stress and tension. All of the other Village Naturals are great products so I have no reluctance in giving it for gifts.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite bubble baths! I purchase several different scents and use them interchangeably. Stress and tension and Restless Nights are my two favorites. A little more expensive but worth it because of the nice bubbles and fabulous scents.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot, my body feels very relaxed when I bathe with this. I like using it after a long day or even in the middle of the day after working out to relieve my muscles, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who enjoys unwinding with a warm and relaxing bath :)</li>
            <li> This is a very invigorating blend and is sure to refresh you completely.  This is not a feminine scent- many men appreciate this. Leaves you relaxed and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product and you don&#x27;t need a lot for a very relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and it really does seem to relieve stress and tention. Good job, people who made this.</li>
            <li> Really, what can I say?  My wife reports that it lathers up well and she has no complaint regarding the product. Price is decent for a boutique product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff in bath</li>
            <li> This product smells great, and produces lots of suds and lather. Made my skin feel smooth. Use it as a soft soap in the shower, or as bubble bath.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath is really good has oil in it so it keeps my skin from becoming dry and itchy. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Makes shower floor a bit oily be careful. It smells really good.</li>
            <li> Actually does relieve stress...give it a try, works great!</li>
            <li> My wife liked the smell and bubbles!  I dont know exactly how much stress and tension any product like this relieves. But I guarantee you, if you fill the tub for her, then wash her back and rub her shoulders a bit, it will do the trick and put a smile on her face. Nice product at a good price, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Have bought this product before and always enjoyed how nice and relaxing my bath water feels.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This does wonders for a stressful day and relaxes you in the bath. Just make sure you lock the bathroom door and plan on an hour of just personal time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is going to be great, as usual, but what I got isn&#x27;t what is advertised. This bottle says aches + pains tension relief, when it&#x27;s supposed to be stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains juniper, orange and menthol, not orange, gingko and olive oil. Was this bottled and labeled incorrectly, possibly? Smells the same as stress and tension, but not what the bottle says.</li>
            <li> I wish the menthol of this bath gel was a bit stronger.  I really can&#x27;t tell that I have it in my bath other than the bubbles it creates.  I use it, but it isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;stress and tension&amp;#34; relief that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at Walmart last year and it is amazing how great this will make you feel after a long and ahrd day.  I suggest everyone try this stuff.  I also like the allergy and cold ones too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one is the best; more bubbles and a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your bath!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many bubble bath products that I can smell for a long time when using them, but sadly this one does not hold up to the test. While the bubbles are good and plenty, the scent is lacking and honestly that&#x27;s what I bought it for. It does nothing for stress or tension. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Used to use bubble bath products when I was younger... as I age into my late 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been having a lot more back pain and just feeling bad in general... wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this stuff but honestly its really great... I like to get the whole tub filled with bubbles , then just smear them all over my chest and face , to where I&#x27;m enveloped and I can feel and hear the bubbles popping and fizzing around my head... this is really nice bubble bath , it has some kind of carbonation / fizz quality , (I think ) , if you turn the bottle upside down and then rightside up you can just see all these bubbles rush to the top... I&#x27;ll be purchasing again , I was pleasently surprised...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only thing I can suggest is throw this thing in a ziplock bag or something because it does leak a LITTLE bit , but it wasnt an issue in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great hours later... not sure if it was just the xanax or this but I honestly think the combination really mellowed me out. Feels great.</li>
            <li> I love anything by Village and so do my daughters and even my son.  Price is great and the scent is wonderful.  Haven&#x27;t had a bad product yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. Smells great, softens skin, relaxes muscles, and revs you up for another day of challenges. Soaking at night ensures a good sleep and sweet dreams. This truly is, in the words of The Bard, \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s sweet restorer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I opened this package to find a bottle with a broken cap and blue goo all over the inside of the packaging.</li>
            <li> RELAX ENJOY GO FOR THE GOLD</li>
            <li> After using this product, I decided I didn&#x27;t really like it. However, it definitely has some merit, albeit in a completely different way. I find the scent to be absolutely overpowering, but that can be good as well. I actually use this in addition to washing with regular soap. Especially now in summer, since it is so hot, and I&#x27;m sweating all the time, this is excellent to use while you&#x27;re taking a shower as it will help cover up any body odor. It doesn&#x27;t relieve my tension at all since the scent is so overpowering, but if you&#x27;re someone who suffers from body odor because you sweat a lot, I would definitely recommend giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the oils part, I didn&#x27;t find that it helped at all. There&#x27;s nothing really oily about it and it doesn&#x27;t really soften my skin.</li>
            <li> I really Like how this product works.  I&#x27;m a big bubble bath enthusiast and this product has good bubbles, nice scent and is long lasting.  Sometimes it even outlasts me!  Most bubble baths seem to dissipate quickly, I find it very refreshing to that there is a product that is able to last so long and smell so good.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff! it&#x27;s only been like 2 weeks since Christmas and she&#x27;s used almost all of it. I will definitely be getting her more!</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect and absolutely not overpowering. Even just sniffing the bottle without taking a bath is really relaxing. Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I love your Liquid mineral bath, stress and tension. I love the scent. I would love it if you had a lotion or perfume in the same scent.</li>
            <li> need this daily,really does calm the brain waves ,love all the bubbles can soak for ever then rest love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Its almost addicting. This is the first bubble bath that I&#x27;ve used in which the bubbles LAST. Smells great and really does relax and help me sleep at night. Works way better than the lavender relax and sleep bubble baths. I am purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing. Has an awesome smell and the bubbles last forever!</li>
            <li> I use this when I take baths.  It relaxes you and makes you feel refreshing! It&#x27;s a great product try it.</li>
