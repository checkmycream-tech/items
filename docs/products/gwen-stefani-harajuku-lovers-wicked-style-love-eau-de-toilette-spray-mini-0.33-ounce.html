            <li>Great service from</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal  and a lot cheaper than purchasing it in the stores.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Am NOT collecting them for the cologne (which is very nice)</li>
            <li>Even when is not the best fragrance form Harajuku Lovers Perfume, I LOVE THIS PERFUME.</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>Purchased for 4 granddaughters for Valentine&#x27;s Day - they loved them.  </li>
            <li>Very cute packaging.</li>
            <li>and I know that I am gonna be buying more!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, and the packaging was good!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s not like some body sprays that just kind of melt off of you after thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>This scent is sooo great not to sweet not to musky yummy yummy.</li>
            <li>This harajuku item was very cute and very fun!</li>
            <li>I got it right on time and the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle and nice scent.</li>
            <li>and I was glad to just stick a bow on it</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume at rock bottom prices.  </li>
            <li>I put this cologne up there with Obsession, Eternity, Polo, DKNY, Gucci, Eternity, BCBG and Betsy Johnson …I love this stuff</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But it is soo cute</li>
            <li>I still recommend the Harajuku Lovers Baby fragrance more than this.</li>
            <li>I love the Harajukeu Brand</li>
            <li>Love the grape scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle is adorable...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>I love this :)</li>
            <li>We love collecting these.</li>
            <li>If you like grape kool-aid (the way it tastes more then the way it smells) then you will love &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34;s smell.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>it kind of smells like a freshly peeled orange to me?</li>
            <li>They feel special having their own little perfume and the presentation of these is perfect for them.  </li>
            <li>Hope to find more at the same great price.</li>
            <li>I got her as an add one when i purchased &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; full size from the wicked line :)</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles because the price was so fantastic</li>
            <li>Product seemed smaller than anticipated but smell is great.</li>
            <li>But it smells fantastic</li>
            <li>I love the container and the scent is nice (personally I don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and the transaction went smoothly.</li>
            <li>The thing I regret the most now is that i didn&#x27;t know how much was 0.33 oz.</li>
            <li>Got several for my nieces and they loved it..</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and the different bottle was really cute.</li>
            <li>This spray is so individual, so unusual, make great gift.</li>
            <li>This smells &amp;#34;grapier&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; than the regular Harajuku Love sprays.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for the bottle and when it arrive it was cuter than expected and the perfume smells amazing!</li>
            <li>But then again, this kind of thing usually depends on your own body chemistry and stuff, so don&#x27;t take my word for it.</li>
            <li>It does have a lovely LOVELY scent that conjures grape fruit and other sorts of flowers.</li>
            <li>This particular one is more sweet than fresh but a soft sweetness.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad at all, it reminds me of Tommy Girl because I smell so much perfumed pear.</li>
            <li>If would know that it was so little, I would have bought a bigger bottle of this magnificent perfume.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Hard to find, so happy i found it.</li>
            <li>…they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>
            <li>First of all, the item arrived very quickly--in around two-three days.</li>
            <li>I have used the baby for a long time and decided to try Love  </li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>it makes me want to buy the whole set</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li>Just has to throw it away since no one wants it.  </li>
            <li>The perfume isn&#x27;t at all bad for around six bucks, and besides, I&#x27;ve seen it at makeup counters for much more, so this is definitely a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I purchased  a few of them, and every time it makes me feel good about my present.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and sellter</li>
            <li>Love all of the Harajuku perfumes and the little bottles they come in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some people talking about how it doesn&#x27;t last long on anything, and to be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much lasting power out of this either.</li>
            <li>You can smell it around you for quite a bit, but it&#x27;s not super strong.</li>
            <li>This is my least favorite of this line so far.  </li>
            <li>It kinda smells like old lady perfume</li>
            <li>I would recommend it on girls in their pre-teen - early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes.</li>
            <li>She smells like grap Kool-aid mixed with more subtle scents</li>
            <li>I love this perfume but the mini is extremely small and not worth</li>
            <li>They were much larger than expected and the price was so much cheaper than I could find them</li>
            <li>I have tried it on my collar and my bare neck, but neither have had it last longer than an hour or two.</li>

            <li> I only have four of these little girls so far.  </li>
            <li> but because I simply like the little figurines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume wearer</li>
            <li> the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I bought a limited edition in Japan (but clearly this can be purchased for only $6 on Amazon...), it comes in a very delicate package, but not made to be carried around, as the figure (aka the cap) is not your typical geometric shape.</li>
            <li> from the Wicked Line yet, but when I run out of this and &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; I&#x27;m def going to try the other Wicked scents,</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these as gifts for little girls.</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with the scent, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Nothing really bad to say about this, except for the fact that 0.33 oz is really not a lot.</li>
            <li> It is for casual wear, may pass for business casual events.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I would wear this out, maybe just to the grocery store or something casual.</li>
            <li> All my friends hate me when I wear it.</li>

            <li> Favorite perfume at rock bottom prices.  Fast service.  I ordered two bottles because the price was so fantastic and I&#x27;ll look for my Gwen Stephani&#x27;s line of Harajuku Perfumes with Amazon from now on.</li>

            <li> Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don’t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes. I put this cologne up there with Obsession, Eternity, Polo, DKNY, Gucci, Eternity, BCBG and Betsy Johnson …I love this stuff…they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>

            <li> I love this perfume but the mini is extremely small and not worth the money spent.  I&#x27;d get the larger next time.</li>
            <li> Got several for my nieces and they loved it.. I love the Harajukeu Brand and I do recommend this purchase..</li>
            <li> Love the grape scent. Reminds me of my childhood. Very cute packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite of this line so far.  I have this one, Baby and Music, and have G on order.  You might like it, though.</li>
            <li> It kinda smells like old lady perfume but it&#x27;s not bad, and the packaging was good!</li>
            <li> The bottle is adorable...this will be a Christmas gift for my niece who loves Japanese culture. So, I haven&#x27;t yet smelled the fragrance, but soon we will know</li>
            <li> I bought a limited edition in Japan (but clearly this can be purchased for only $6 on Amazon...), it comes in a very delicate package, but not made to be carried around, as the figure (aka the cap) is not your typical geometric shape. It does have a lovely LOVELY scent that conjures grape fruit and other sorts of flowers. I would recommend it on girls in their pre-teen - early 20&#x27;s. It is for casual wear, may pass for business casual events. The only downside to the fragrance is that it does not last long no matter where you spray it. I have tried it on my collar and my bare neck, but neither have had it last longer than an hour or two. Over all, it&#x27;s still good stuff!</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad at all, it reminds me of Tommy Girl because I smell so much perfumed pear. It&#x27;s a cutesy type of scent, pear mixed with grape lollipops. It&#x27;s cute but I don&#x27;t think I would wear this out, maybe just to the grocery store or something casual.</li>
            <li> First of all, the item arrived very quickly--in around two-three days. The perfume isn&#x27;t at all bad for around six bucks, and besides, I&#x27;ve seen it at makeup counters for much more, so this is definitely a good bargain. Smells like fruit--maybe peaches or something--mixed with some sort of powdery flower. I&#x27;ve seen some people talking about how it doesn&#x27;t last long on anything, and to be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much lasting power out of this either. However, I sprayed some on my neck in the morning, and around 3 in the afternoon, I still smelled it when I ran a hand through my hair. But then again, this kind of thing usually depends on your own body chemistry and stuff, so don&#x27;t take my word for it. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s not like some body sprays that just kind of melt off of you after thirty minutes. You can smell it around you for quite a bit, but it&#x27;s not super strong. Nothing really bad to say about this, except for the fact that 0.33 oz is really not a lot. Guess I&#x27;ll be restocking soon, then.</li>
            <li> This smells &amp;#34;grapier&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; than the regular Harajuku Love sprays. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. But it smells fantastic I love this :)</li>
            <li> Hard to find, so happy i found it.Smells great. We love collecting these.Hope to find more at the same great price.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle and nice scent. Purchased it as a gift and she loved everything about it! Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This scent is sooo great not to sweet not to musky yummy yummy. I have used the baby for a long time and decided to try Love  and I know that I am gonna be buying more!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these as gifts for little girls. They were much larger than expected and the price was so much cheaper than I could find them any where else. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I only have four of these little girls so far.  Am NOT collecting them for the cologne (which is very nice) but because I simply like the little figurines.  I buy them when the price is under $15 since I am not buying them for the scent.</li>
            <li> I thought It would be the same &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; I had before but this one smells aweful.  All my friends hate me when I wear it. Just has to throw it away since no one wants it.  If you are not familiar with the scent, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I got her as an add one when i purchased &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; full size from the wicked line :) I like her, and whatr a great deal! If you like grape kool-aid (the way it tastes more then the way it smells) then you will love &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34;s smell. She smells like grap Kool-aid mixed with more subtle scents and I love it. I haven&#x27;t tried &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Music&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; from the Wicked Line yet, but when I run out of this and &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; I&#x27;m def going to try the other Wicked scents,</li>
