            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love the size of it.</li>
            <li>Plus I LOVE that it can start to straighten while my hair is still damp.  </li>
            <li>Even I notice the difference in my wife&#x27;s hair!  :)</li>
            <li>the iron has products that leave your hair with with an unreal healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>i had a chi 2 inch flat iron which was awesome.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was impressed with how this flat iron effectively turned my damp hair into steam.</li>
            <li>She has fine, curly hair and it looks shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>This iron flattens my hair QUICK!  </li>
            <li>I have been a faithful user of the original 1-inch Chi ceramic hair straightener for 4 years before I foolishly broke it by sticking it in a 220-volt power outlet overseas.</li>
            <li>It makes me hair very smooth and soft, I love it.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I love the wider version</li>
            <li>hair is fine and very straight</li>
            <li>Chi heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I am used to a far better quality straightener than this.</li>
            <li>Red is a nice color</li>
            <li>As it turned out, I use this all the time because it is fast, effective, and dies not dry out or burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets nice and hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and shiny and I&#x27;m not stuck in the bathroom for 45 mins trying to get it that way!  </li>
            <li>Its pretty ...</li>
            <li>and this is gentle on my hair and it becomes very shiny!</li>
            <li>I decided to replace my 1 inch wet/dry chi after 5 years of rough use (many drops and trips in checked baggage).</li>
            <li>Finally I found an iron that is worth the money and worth the effort to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time to go back to what&#x27;s tried and true.</li>
            <li>Applied at the roots, you can quickly pull this through the hair and the end result is instant volume.</li>
            <li>So, I had high expectations for the Chi brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for people with &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally broke down and bought this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft but it also made it frizzy and not even remotely straight.</li>
            <li>I suppose it is worth spending the extra money after all.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t get my curly hair very straight, and it left a lot of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I live in FL and its way to hot to dry my hair with a dryer then straiten.</li>
            <li>so it should be faster than my old 1-inch.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair really soft too.</li>
            <li>I always had problems with time management in the morning, so finding a way to dry AND straighten my hair with a larger ceramic pad seemed like a dream come true.   </li>
            <li>To guarantee that my styling works all day long even on the most humid of days, I apply Paul Mitchell Volumnizer to damp, towel dried hair before I start using the Chi.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My former 1-inch iron used to boil the water and spit it out at me, making it useful only on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I returned it and bought the Remington wet to straight 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I admit that I have super thick, curly hair, but this was never a problem for my old 1-inch Chi iron.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to iron super small sections in order to get a sleek look.  </li>
            <li>I had a regular ceramic chi for years that finally broke, and I knew I wanted to replace it with a wet to straight.</li>
            <li>so I really like the inch and a half.</li>

            <li> so I really like the inch and a half.</li>
            <li> I tried it on barely damp hair, I tried it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels coarse, it does not heat very well and over all, my hair looks dry and messy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron.</li>
            <li> ceramic flat iron for $45</li>
            <li> She claims that it can do her hair in almost half the time as her old 1&amp;#34; iron.</li>
            <li> However, this one took sooooooo long (about 15 minutes) to dry my hair enough to be straightened that the advantage was lost (even on max temperature setting).</li>
            <li> Now I just do a damp dry with the dryer and finish with this strainer</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on wet hair, but I don&#x27;t have to let my hair dry all the way.</li>
            <li> Only thing missing is an automatic shut off, I leave it on a lot by accident, never caused any problems though.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I suspect it has something to do with the steam holes in the Damp-to-Dry Iron&#x27;s design that reduces the functioning surface area and makes it less efficient at straightening.</li>
            <li> The small chi&#x27;s seem to be a little too small for me, but I don&#x27;t like a 2 inch flat iron</li>
            <li> It does pull my hair a little though ...</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and never has any issues.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it took forever to straighten my hair to barely acceptable levels.</li>
            <li> however this product is not very good.</li>
            <li> either a knock off or CHI is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> This one is expensive, but I chose it because I trusted Chi brand.</li>

            <li> i had a chi 2 inch flat iron which was awesome.  i read the product description and thought this would be awesome.  however this product is not very good. my hair feels coarse, it does not heat very well and over all, my hair looks dry and messy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets nice and hot. I haven&#x27;t used it on wet hair, but I don&#x27;t have to let my hair dry all the way. It makes me hair very smooth and soft, I love it. I love the size of it. The small chi&#x27;s seem to be a little too small for me, but I don&#x27;t like a 2 inch flat iron so I really like the inch and a half. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of the original 1-inch Chi ceramic hair straightener for 4 years before I foolishly broke it by sticking it in a 220-volt power outlet overseas. So, I had high expectations for the Chi brand. I always had problems with time management in the morning, so finding a way to dry AND straighten my hair with a larger ceramic pad seemed like a dream come true.   At first, I was impressed with how this flat iron effectively turned my damp hair into steam. My former 1-inch iron used to boil the water and spit it out at me, making it useful only on dry hair. However, this one took sooooooo long (about 15 minutes) to dry my hair enough to be straightened that the advantage was lost (even on max temperature setting). I might as well have blow-dried my hair, and THEN straightened it. Well, I thought, at least the straightening part should be worth it because it&#x27;s a Chi, and it&#x27;s 1.5 inches so it should be faster than my old 1-inch. NO!! Sadly, it took forever to straighten my hair to barely acceptable levels. I am used to a far better quality straightener than this. I admit that I have super thick, curly hair, but this was never a problem for my old 1-inch Chi iron. I suspect it has something to do with the steam holes in the Damp-to-Dry Iron&#x27;s design that reduces the functioning surface area and makes it less efficient at straightening. It&#x27;s time to go back to what&#x27;s tried and true.</li>
            <li> This iron flattens my hair QUICK!  I don&#x27;t have to iron super small sections in order to get a sleek look.  Plus I LOVE that it can start to straighten while my hair is still damp.  My hair is straight and shiny and I&#x27;m not stuck in the bathroom for 45 mins trying to get it that way!  Hooray!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife. She uses it everyday and never has any issues. Loves it.</li>
            <li> Finally I found an iron that is worth the money and worth the effort to use. It leaves hair really soft too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She no longer uses the blow dryer. She has fine, curly hair and it looks shiny and sleek. Best of all, she gets read faster.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally broke down and bought this flat iron. Despite some of the unfavorable reviews, I decided to give it a try. It works so well on my hair type (curly and a bit course). I highly recommend this for people with &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace my 1 inch wet/dry chi after 5 years of rough use (many drops and trips in checked baggage). It took me awhile to get used to the 1 1/2 inch plates, but now that I&#x27;m used to it I love it, excellent results.</li>
            <li> either a knock off or CHI is not a good product.  does not heat to what states on dial.  does not straighten hair!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron. She claims that it can do her hair in almost half the time as her old 1&amp;#34; iron.</li>
            <li> this is awesome. I live in FL and its way to hot to dry my hair with a dryer then straiten. Now I just do a damp dry with the dryer and finish with this strainer and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> I suppose it is worth spending the extra money after all.  Even I notice the difference in my wife&#x27;s hair!  :)</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t get my curly hair very straight, and it left a lot of frizz.  I had hoped it would work as well as the kind used by professionals.</li>
            <li> Great product the wife liked it. Very fast delivery! Red is a nice color and it&#x27;s the big one you know.</li>
            <li> I like the safetiness of the iron.  the iron has products that leave your hair with with an unreal healthy shine.  love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great Straightener, can&#x27;t beat a CHI.  Only thing missing is an automatic shut off, I leave it on a lot by accident, never caused any problems though.  I would recommend this straightener, does a great job without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> Its pretty ... Ive only gotten to use it once but so fare so good : ) It does pull my hair a little though ...</li>
            <li> Love it. Does excatly what it says it will do. It heats up fast and I love the wider version</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would work as promised when I was in a hurry. As it turned out, I use this all the time because it is fast, effective, and dies not dry out or burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This Chi heats quickly and evenly. Applied at the roots, you can quickly pull this through the hair and the end result is instant volume. To guarantee that my styling works all day long even on the most humid of days, I apply Paul Mitchell Volumnizer to damp, towel dried hair before I start using the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and very straight so I can only attest that it will work wonders on that hair type. The end results are great.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this sooner.  I have very fine hair and this is gentle on my hair and it becomes very shiny!</li>
            <li> grandaughter loved it</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this just didn&#x27;t work. I had a regular ceramic chi for years that finally broke, and I knew I wanted to replace it with a wet to straight. This one is expensive, but I chose it because I trusted Chi brand. Mistake! I tried it on barely damp hair, I tried it on dry hair. It did make my hair soft but it also made it frizzy and not even remotely straight. Just poofy. I returned it and bought the Remington wet to straight 1&amp;#34; ceramic flat iron for $45 and I LOVE it. I would definitely recommend that one instead.</li>
            <li> Was good for a while.  Lasted about 7 months then crapped out. Worked well when it worked..</li>
            <li> :I love CHI brand products!</li>
