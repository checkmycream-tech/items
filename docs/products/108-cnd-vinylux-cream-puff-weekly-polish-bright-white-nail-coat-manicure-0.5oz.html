            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well as fingernail polish, and it is  a lot cheaper than a lighted sight, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>

            <li>The best feature of this nail polish is how fast it dries and hardens.  </li>

            <li>I am very happy with my recent purchased of  CND Vinylux Cream Puff weekly Polish Bright Nail Coat manicure.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>color Cream Puff is the perfect color for any type of French.</li>
            <li>and since there are so many perks about this nail polish, it doesn&#x27;t stop me from ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed this with 2 coats of the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>After a week I reapplied another coat of the Top Coat and my manicure lasted 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Perfect french!</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Went on easily and easy off.  </li>
            <li>for important events.</li>
            <li>Looks great for French manicure.  </li>
            <li>I put on a couple of coats of this, and now I can see the front sight in all light conditions.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about it when a favorite blogger of mine mentioned it in their posts</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT white for a French Manicure.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>so the tip turns out perfect - not thick and uneven.</li>
            <li>The color is great with 2 coats but doesn&#x27;t last as long as 7 days, more like 3 before you start seeing noticeable chips.</li>
            <li>However, I think it DOES have a tad more staying power than traditional polish, which makes this polish worth it for me.</li>
            <li>great quality but hard on your nails</li>
            <li>I used  it on top of Red Baroness.</li>
            <li>the color names to see them on real peoples&#x27; hands.</li>
            <li>I love the contrast that this color has with my skin however, the top coat polish makes it start to turn yellow after a few days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t absolutely adore the color</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of bottles of polish to get a real opaque look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very opaque</li>
            <li>I like the simple clean on my&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
            <li>This is a true White !!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>First I applied a light pink from the Vinylux line and then the white.  </li>
            <li>This is a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>It was very Professional.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will try a clear basecoat first to see if it makes it easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>My self-done manicures last absolutely chip-free for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>so much i have gone ahead and bought several colors!</li>
            <li>for weddings, black tie affairs, special occasions</li>
            <li>Both the front and rear sights are black, so in a low light condition it&#x27;s hard to make sure you are correctly aligned.  </li>
            <li>w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips.</li>
            <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li>it DOES stay on a full week, i do put a second coat of clear on half way thru the week just to give it that  &#x27;just polished&#x27; shine again, but i don&#x27;t mind that at all!  </li>
            <li>It applies so easy and you just have to use one thin coat -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long lasting for a French manicure.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that when purchasing these nail polishes through Amazon, it is sometimes hard to determine the exact color you are getting.</li>
            <li> I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really do not have scratches for a 1 week.</li>
            <li> but it performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> For some reason this nail polish did not perform as well as other CND colors.</li>
            <li> Once it gets on your fingers, your fingers turn white and it&#x27;s hard to get off even with 100% acetone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I well made product and since it is usually cheaper than Essie (at least sold by the retailers near me), I will keep ordering this brand of polishes.</li>
            <li> You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the problem with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that is about</li>
            <li> But since it doesn&#x27;t peel off as easily as gel, the polish will stay on and not look awful for about 5 days for me.</li>
            <li> It went on extremely thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> Please take into account that I am very rough on my nails and usually redo my nails after 3-4 days anyway because I hate chips.</li>
            <li> Also, getting this color off is a pain because it smears really bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointment!</li>
            <li> I guarantee you won,t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The polish streaks and looks terrible!</li>
            <li> This is the worst Vinylux I ever purchased.</li>

            <li> The polish streaks and looks terrible!</li>
            <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> Long lasting for a French manicure.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my recent purchased of  CND Vinylux Cream Puff weekly Polish Bright Nail Coat manicure.  It really works on my nails, so that I have my seven days manicure, in a perfect way</li>
            <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Cream Puff is the perfect color for any type of French. It is a good color to keep&lt;br /&gt;around for weddings, black tie affairs, special occasions etc.... I like the simple clean on my&lt;br /&gt;nails for important events.</li>
            <li> great quality but hard on your nails</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will have to let me know what she thinks of this product.  I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Vinylux I ever purchased. It went on extremely thick and goopy. Had to remove immediately. Threw out</li>
            <li> This is a true White !! You can use this color for a French  Manicure but I use it as a Nail color. Great if you have a tan.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! I first heard about it when a favorite blogger of mine mentioned it in their posts so I had to try it. Since this blogger said she found hers on Amazon, I checked there for it too and found it. This color is perfect for summer since it is bright white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product claims to last a week, in reality, it does not. However, I think it DOES have a tad more staying power than traditional polish, which makes this polish worth it for me. My self-done manicures last absolutely chip-free for 2-3 days. But since it doesn&#x27;t peel off as easily as gel, the polish will stay on and not look awful for about 5 days for me. Please take into account that I am very rough on my nails and usually redo my nails after 3-4 days anyway because I hate chips. I type all day, do dishes without gloves, wash my hands a lot, and yet my manicure stays on for several days and remains shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when purchasing these nail polishes through Amazon, it is sometimes hard to determine the exact color you are getting. I try to go to the CND website to take a look at their color samples as well as Google the color names to see them on real peoples&#x27; hands. I find this helps, but also isn&#x27;t the best solution. I just think it&#x27;s the nature of the beast with ordering stuff online and since there are so many perks about this nail polish, it doesn&#x27;t stop me from ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I well made product and since it is usually cheaper than Essie (at least sold by the retailers near me), I will keep ordering this brand of polishes.</li>
            <li> For some reason this nail polish did not perform as well as other CND colors. I am not sure of the problem with it. I have tried couple different applications with no difference in performance.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as sheer as I like.</li>
            <li> I love the contrast that this color has with my skin however, the top coat polish makes it start to turn yellow after a few days. I&#x27;m not sure what that is about but I don&#x27;t care for that. Also, getting this color off is a pain because it smears really bad. Once it gets on your fingers, your fingers turn white and it&#x27;s hard to get off even with 100% acetone.</li>
            <li> Best polish I ever had - lasts forever</li>
            <li> The color is great with 2 coats but doesn&#x27;t last as long as 7 days, more like 3 before you start seeing noticeable chips.</li>
            <li> I had a french manicure at a Ritz Carlton in FL using all the Vinylux products. Being on the beach, swimming/sunscreen &amp; sand the manicure literally lasted all week, which prompted me to buy the very same products as soon as I got home. Disappointment! I don&#x27;t know what is different, but w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really do not have scratches for a 1 week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t absolutely adore the color but it performs as expected.  It is a great line from this company.  Color is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I chose this color to do a french manicure.  First I applied a light pink from the Vinylux line and then the white.  The white is opaque.  I followed this with 2 coats of the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.  After a week I reapplied another coat of the Top Coat and my manicure lasted 2 weeks.  You need an acetone based nail polish remover to get it off.  Next time I will try a clear basecoat first to see if it makes it easier to remove.  The best feature of this nail polish is how fast it dries and hardens.  I finished my manicure at 10 pm and went to bed at 11:30 pm, woke with no sheet marks on my nails, they were perfect.  I allowed about 15 minutes between coats.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the Cake Pop color, which is also a creme.  I&#x27;m sure this will be just as wonderful.  Looks nice in the bottle.  I am really happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> It was very Professional.  I have bought a lot of bottles of polish to get a real opaque look. I guarantee you won,t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Vinylux Nail Lacquer is awesome!  it DOES stay on a full week, i do put a second coat of clear on half way thru the week just to give it that  &#x27;just polished&#x27; shine again, but i don&#x27;t mind that at all!  I like it so much i have gone ahead and bought several colors!</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me.  Went on easily and easy off.  Looks great for French manicure.  I used  it on top of Red Baroness.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Perfect french!, with The top coat it lasts more than a week shiny and no chips, best nail polish ever</li>
            <li> I got this to make the front site of my S&amp;W bodyguard show up better and it works great.  Both the front and rear sights are black, so in a low light condition it&#x27;s hard to make sure you are correctly aligned.  I put on a couple of coats of this, and now I can see the front sight in all light conditions.  I&#x27;m sure it works well as fingernail polish, and it is  a lot cheaper than a lighted sight, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT white for a French Manicure.  It applies so easy and you just have to use one thin coat - it&#x27;s very opaque so the tip turns out perfect - not thick and uneven.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Love the product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great alternative for shellac.</li>
