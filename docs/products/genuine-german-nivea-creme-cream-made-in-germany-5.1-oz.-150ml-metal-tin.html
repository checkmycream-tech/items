    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s also wonderful for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how much beautiful skin can enhance your looks.</li>
            <li>So Happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I loved that hint of lavender on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smell good.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be buying again!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous !!</li>
            <li>This is a amazing skin cream.</li>
            <li>Nice quality cream.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to find the kind from Germany, specifically.</li>
            <li>It is clearing up some  very irritated skin that I experienced.</li>
            <li>Once i got it, a piece of paper label added on tin saying it is made in Germany, which is not quite sure on its authentication.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for years and love this product.  </li>
            <li>THIS is 100 times better and I am now a lifetime user.</li>
            <li>But I love this cream-</li>
            <li>Looks good and feels like the right cream.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect way to hydrate your skin and get rid of all the dry and flaky skin you may have.  </li>
            <li>And for a fair price, the products are definitely new.</li>
            <li>Of course it also helps to adopt healthy habits like always having a good night&#x27;s sleep, drinking plenty of water before breakfast, eating lots of vegetables &amp; fruits, doing moderate exercise to control your weight and avoiding sun exposure, alcohol, smoking &amp; soda.</li>
            <li>Thus is the real authentic German nivea.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it but decided to try German Nivea because it is said to be so much thicker and better.</li>
            <li>So I am still giving 3 stars, and this review is more of a clarification of the overly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this creme and its the real thing.</li>
            <li>I bought the Nivea Creme because of all the positive reviews, and an apparently popular comment about its similarity to the super-expensive La Mer facial creme.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of different from the real one too.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the GERMAN Nivea Creme</li>
            <li>I have compared this to Le Mer, and I love the German Nivea.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>The only difference I can discern is a slightly more citrusy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ordered from F Koeller and received the Genuine German stuff</li>
            <li>Genuine German creme!</li>
            <li>It is a very creamy product and I hope it is working to keep the wrinkles from forming on my face.</li>
            <li>and I found out they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I know which is real and not.</li>
            <li>Now I know where to get the real one.</li>
            <li>At first when I applied the creme it felt heavy, but it was absorbed quickly into my skin and added a lot of moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and find that while this is very thick, a tiny bit leaves my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Even with its thickness, no break out and actually very clear skin.  </li>
            <li>This seems exactly the same as the version made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>The no name, small stores downtown sells most of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly the same ingredients as Crem de La Mer except 90% cheaper.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face daily;)</li>
            <li>I put German Nivea on my face, neck, arms and legs after shower every evening, rubbing in with a gentle massage with my finger tips.</li>
            <li>Nivea evens out the skin tone, makes it soft and supple and gives it a translucent glow.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li>I live in Boulder, CO and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>The German cream is much thicker and richer than it&#x27;s American cousin!</li>
            <li>Super thick and hydrating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ordered from F Koeller and received the Genuine German stuff</li>
            <li> I bought the Nivea Creme because of all the positive reviews, and an apparently popular comment about its similarity to the super-expensive La Mer facial creme. But it falls way short of La Mer. Well, given the price, it is not really surprising. So I am still giving 3 stars, and this review is more of a clarification of the overly positive reviews. Now I am using this cream for body.</li>
            <li> I put German Nivea on my face, neck, arms and legs after shower every evening, rubbing in with a gentle massage with my finger tips. Then I wash them off every morning. Nivea evens out the skin tone, makes it soft and supple and gives it a translucent glow. I feel liberated that I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup anymore. All I need is to put on loose face powder before going out. You will be amazed at how much beautiful skin can enhance your looks. Of course it also helps to adopt healthy habits like always having a good night&#x27;s sleep, drinking plenty of water before breakfast, eating lots of vegetables &amp; fruits, doing moderate exercise to control your weight and avoiding sun exposure, alcohol, smoking &amp; soda.</li>
            <li> The German cream is much thicker and richer than it&#x27;s American cousin! Definitely get this. It&#x27;s like La Mer without the sticker shock! Tin will last me FOREVER because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the GERMAN Nivea Creme&lt;br /&gt;The only moisturizer I use. Mind you, my skin is dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Genuine German creme! Super thick and hydrating. I love it and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have compared this to Le Mer, and I love the German Nivea.  A total difference in in the texture of my skin.  Even with its thickness, no break out and actually very clear skin.  Could not be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> Thus is the real authentic German nivea. A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love this creme and its the real thing. You can feel the difference the first time you use it. Thank you</li>
            <li> During the summer and winter months, the weather elements can be cruel to my skin so I need a product that heals my skin and adds moisture and this Nivea Skin Creme is the perfect answer.At first when I applied the creme it felt heavy, but it was absorbed quickly into my skin and added a lot of moisture.  This is the perfect way to hydrate your skin and get rid of all the dry and flaky skin you may have.  The skin creme doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and really provides moisture to your skin all day long</li>
            <li> This is a amazing skin cream. It is clearing up some  very irritated skin that I experienced. It has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Its no better than the big jar in walmart....what is all the rave reviews about!? Just buy the ((Big)) jar in walmart and save your money!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous !! Do not buy the those expensive creams. This one is all you need!!</li>
            <li> It is a very creamy product and I hope it is working to keep the wrinkles from forming on my face.</li>
            <li> My Nivea came and yes, it is Made in Germany. So Happy with this product. A little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using US Nivea which is made in Mexico for a couple of years. I am happy with it but decided to try German Nivea because it is said to be so much thicker and better. The tin that arrived had stickers placed on the front and back saying \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; but nowhere on the actual tin does it say that. Another reviewer noted that if you peel off the stickers the tin says \\&quot;Made in Poland\\&quot; but mine did not. It does not specify a country of manufacture at all. The ingredients listed on the sticker differ slightly from the ones listed on the actual tin.  When I opened the tin I was disappointed to find that it&#x27;s not any thicker than Mexican Nivea. The only difference I can discern is a slightly more citrusy fragrance. Was I ripped off? This seems exactly the same as the version made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I placed the order as it says it is made in Germany. Once i got it, a piece of paper label added on tin saying it is made in Germany, which is not quite sure on its authentication. For only this reason, i gave two stars. The price paid is for the one supposed made in Germany.</li>
            <li> The writings on the back of the can are Euro. It says Beiersdorf  Hamburg and other Euro countries on the back of the can. Smells the same as the Euro one&#x27;s I used to buy when I lived in Asia. I loved that hint of lavender on the fragrance. Euro cosmetics are common in the city where I used to live for some unknown reason. I think the owners of the small stores where I got them buys a lot when travelling to Europe then sells them when they get home. The no name, small stores downtown sells most of them. Even perfume and cologne from Europe can be purchased there and I can assure everyone that I tried a lot of those products there and I found out they are the real deal. The same as what I bought at the premium outlets. And for a fair price, the products are definitely new. I mean fresh. Just like when it came from the factory. I can tell... It&#x27;s pretty obvious. So, this one made in Germany is the same as the one&#x27;s I used to buy there. I used a lot of these in the past and I know which is real and not. Made in Mexico is like a crappy knock off version when it comes to the texture of the creme. Smells kind of different from the real one too. Satisfied with this product. Now I know where to get the real one. Will buy a bigger tin next time.</li>
            <li> Nice quality cream.  Smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for years and love this product.  I live in Boulder, CO and use it daily.  I apply it to my face when I&#x27;m going to at home.  I use it like a face mask to continuously moisturizer my face when working at home.</li>
            <li> This is literally the holy grail of face cream. Almost exactly the same ingredients as Crem de La Mer except 90% cheaper. I&#x27;m in the states and I use to use the american Nivea cream for my night time eye cream. THIS is 100 times better and I am now a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the 400 ml jar and it took almost 3 x longer until product arrived. Gave this to a friend, so I can&#x27;t compare the quality of the product, Also this jar  was shipped from different location  thru different company.</li>
            <li> Advertisement says &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34;.  What I received was a Nivea tin made in THAILAND.  This is false advertising.  Item was immediately returned.</li>
            <li> As stated, this is in fact the Made in Germany version.  I have combination skin and find that while this is very thick, a tiny bit leaves my skin feeling great.  As others have said, it&#x27;s also wonderful for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Looks good and feels like the right cream. I am confused about its origin, as the writing on the back is in a different language. I was hoping to find the kind from Germany, specifically. But I love this cream- keeps me looking hydrated (yes- I put it on my face daily;)</li>
