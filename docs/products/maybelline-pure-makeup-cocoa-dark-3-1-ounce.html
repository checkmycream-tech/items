    <ol>
            <li> Blended well with my skin loved it</li>
            <li> It actually is a little darker than i expected, so i mix it with a shade lighter that i have and i am a chocolate brown. I like the coverage with just a little natural face powder cause i really don&#x27;t want heavy chemicals on my skin, as i try to keep it healthy and i do get a lot of compliments on my skin even when i don&#x27;t wear make-up. This is good for someone without problem skin, would not hide flaws as they suggested..</li>
            <li> nice product - I just ordered the wrong color.  Oops!</li>
            <li> Great coverage,  but too much for summer months. Switched to a light powder because the liquid was just too much for the heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> They discontinued this at the local store.  It doesn&#x27;t have super-mattifying ability, but works and blends to skin tone better than $40 foundations.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and how it made my face look but it was a bit darker, then what I used in the past. my friends told me  I looked great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to foundation. It&#x27;s the perfect shade for me. It goes on easy and washes off cleanly. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that fits my color without any highlighting or anything not watery dries smooth not sticky one of my faves will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so this is perfect for my skin since it&#x27;s water based. It matches my skin color well and people can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing foundation. It gives a sheer coverage so if you are looking for a full coverage, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Matches my skin complexion to the max! I&#x27;ll def by more</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural look, wish I was bigger tube  ☺ and it light weight foundation</li>
            <li> I love the value of this makeup. I am a woman of color and its not easy finding the right texture of makeup. But when I came across this, I felt like a kid in the candy store!!!!!!!!!!! Great buy, love the smooth water base.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product about a year ago and I love the way it feels. It&#x27;s not oily at all and sometimes I forget that I have it on. The coverage is sufficient for my skin. It is an affordable product and I&#x27;m sad that it was discontinued (that&#x27;s why I bought two). My only issue is I can never find a true match for my skin tone (especially n the summer or winter) but thus is very close.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation because it is water based, light, covers well and allows the face to breathe. I was really bummed when i found out that it was discontinued. This product introduced me to maybelline foundations and they are one of the best brands made for the colored girls that blends well and still make us look natural.I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! As a chocolate complected woman It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find affordable make up that doesn&#x27;t look obvious. This Item is amazing. seriously. It sucks that I can&#x27;t buy it at the stores but  I will stock up. It has such a sheer clear finish that makes you still look natural. love it!</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the pure makeup because it does not provide enough coverage and it does not stay on for the full day.</li>
            <li> I think this  makeup is great for woman with oily skin. great oil control and very natural look. I stongly recommend.</li>
            <li> So happy I ordered this make-up. I think it may be discontinued now - I hope not because I just found it and it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This matched my complexion perfectly. It doesnt make my face ashy, it goes on very smooth and blends well. Great buy</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline Pure Makeup! I really hate this is now a discontinued item.  By me having really oily skin this water based make up is  for me!</li>
            <li> It fits my skin tone perfectly! The coverage is amazing...it&#x27;s light and natural looking. However, I have oily skin and it peaks through.</li>
