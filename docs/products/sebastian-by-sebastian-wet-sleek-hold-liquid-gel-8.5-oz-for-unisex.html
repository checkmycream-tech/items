            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>thus I had to use more for the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Many bottles of gel wound up in the trash can.</li>
            <li>Very clean and light - so glad I can still order it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Will buy more if it remains available.</li>
            <li>me back to the day, still love this great</li>
            <li>This is a light, clean gel that does a fabulous job and washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>It feels and looks CLEAN.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve tried many other gels and none are as good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it so easy to purchase.</li>
            <li>Ordering was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I loved Wet!  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the product continues to do as it has been on my hair.  </li>
            <li>anyone has any idea which other product comes close and is available, please let know :)</li>
            <li>also seems like you have to put ALOT of product in to get some hold in the first place.</li>
            <li>It added a nice little curl to my natural/processed hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Sebastian Wet Gel for many years, but for some reason it has not been sold in stores.</li>
            <li>After showering, apply to very damp hair.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>do you people really pay $60 for hair gel?  </li>
            <li>I love Sebastian Wet, use it for years.</li>
            <li>so I have experimented with many other products.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I also am mystified as to why Sebastian discontinued this product - it&#x27;s a classic, works so well</li>
            <li>If you find it too strong, just add some more water or use a little less.</li>
            <li>Curls are in place and very soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t exist any more, and even if you find it, you&#x27;ll pay 4-5 times the original price</li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t like the wet scrunched look, just brush through your hair after its dry, no wet look, just nice hold.</li>
            <li>Others with curls might have better luck with this product, but I feel like I was charged alot for something that gives you the wet look for such a short time, with no hold.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me to use on natural hair as well as relaxed hair to create curls.</li>
            <li>Before it was completely gone, I bought a crate of it.</li>
            <li>This product provides a nice sheen to the hair and does not leave that stiff, sticky, residue feeling as with other types of gels.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for having this product available for it is a difficult product to find.</li>
            <li>Used it once and the gel seemed a little more watered down than the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a classic case of bad market research, a company discontinuing a successful product and keeping in its product line dozens of other obscure/useless/non-competitive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds my curls very well without being hard like normal gels.</li>

            <li> It holds my curls very well without being hard like normal gels.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wet for at least 20 years and as many of your previous reviewers state, there is nothing else like it.</li>
            <li> , if you put too much, it would make the hair too stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that it way too expensive and the way i use it at this rate it will be gone with 2 weeks or a little more.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; styling gel is long gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but it&#x27;s close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scrunch with your hands and leave air dry or use a diffuser.</li>
            <li> this product works wonders on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;wet&#x27; look only lasts until your hair dries, at this point the gel becomes very hard in your hair and feels really awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, long (mid back,)</li>
            <li> OILY MAKES YOUR HARIR LOOK WET AND SLEEK.</li>
            <li> It can give you a \\&quot;wet-look\\&quot; if you just run it thru wet hair after showering and leave it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to shampoo every day, you can just wet your hands and run them thru your hair and restyle on day two.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look really wet and curly all day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a  product that left a &#x27;wet&#x27; look along with some hold without drying hard ,</li>
            <li> The reviewer who said it only works for two hours and would be hard to wash out is just wrong (or using WAY too much product).</li>
            <li> At least until Matrix is gobbled up by some big company that discontinues it as well.</li>
            <li> i have extremely tight curls</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s has a little bit stronger hold.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to find, since the manufacturer has discontinued this.  </li>
            <li> When I was unable to find it locally, I searched Amazon and behold there</li>
            <li> Im not sure what this is</li>
            <li> Not sure if I truly have PS product or not.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Sebastian discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> or my hair will look like crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why Sebastian Products discontinued this item. It&#x27;s the only \\&quot;thin\\&quot; hair product that does not flake and still holds. Thank goodness there is still a way to purchase it at AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Im so upset they discontinued this product! i have extremely tight curls and this is the only product that isnt gooey and gross from my hair! i love it!..please keep selling it on here!! or my hair will look like crap! lol &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the level of service and the timeliness of the delivery of the product from when I ordered it on line intil it was delivered to my fron door.</li>
            <li> IT IS WONDERFUL.  A LOT OF STORES STOP CARRYING IT SO THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO ORDER IT FROM.  NOT GREASSY OR OILY MAKES YOUR HARIR LOOK WET AND SLEEK.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave any flakes in your hair. It is a wonderful product and has lasting hold.</li>
            <li> IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  JUST WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Wet Gel for many years, but for some reason it has not been sold in stores. This product provides a nice sheen to the hair and does not leave that stiff, sticky, residue feeling as with other types of gels. Great product and I hope to continue purchasing it online - regardless of the expense.</li>
            <li> I would like to thank you for carrying this product.  This product is not easy to find, since the manufacturer has discontinued this.  The entire process from ordering to receiving is excellent.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase.</li>
            <li> The product meet my needs. Thanks so much for having this product available for it is a difficult product to find.</li>
            <li> When I saw that this product was discountinued, I made sure to stock up! After showering, apply to very damp hair. Scrunch with your hands and leave air dry or use a diffuser. I have thick, long (mid back,) curly hair and I can&#x27;t live without it! Nothing else works the same, and I&#x27;ve tried many different (and expensive) products. You will end up with frizz-free, beautiful, non-stiff curls, if used right. A definite must have!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wet for at least 20 years and as many of your previous reviewers state, there is nothing else like it. It can give you a \\&quot;wet-look\\&quot; if you just run it thru wet hair after showering and leave it. It is also great for controlling thicker curly hair for styling (me). It feels and looks CLEAN. If you don&#x27;t want to shampoo every day, you can just wet your hands and run them thru your hair and restyle on day two. The reviewer who said it only works for two hours and would be hard to wash out is just wrong (or using WAY too much product). This is a light, clean gel that does a fabulous job and washes out very easily. I also am mystified as to why Sebastian discontinued this product - it&#x27;s a classic, works so well and there&#x27;s nothing else like it - I&#x27;ve tried many other gels and none are as good. Also, if you don&#x27;t like the wet scrunched look, just brush through your hair after its dry, no wet look, just nice hold. Very clean and light - so glad I can still order it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product for years.  When I was unable to find it locally, I searched Amazon and behold there it was.  The price is right and the product continues to do as it has been on my hair.  Curls are in place and very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this hair gel. Perfect for curly hair.  Unfortunately, Sebastian discontinued this product. It&#x27;s nice to know that someone, somewhere still has a bit of an inventory.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It holds my curls very well without being hard like normal gels. Once it dries it leaves my hair soft and curly with a wet look. It also smells great!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a  product that left a &#x27;wet&#x27; look along with some hold without drying hard ,&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately the &#x27;wet&#x27; look only lasts until your hair dries, at this point the gel becomes very hard in your hair and feels really awful.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems like you have to put ALOT of product in to get some hold in the first place. Others with curls might have better luck with this product, but I feel like I was charged alot for something that gives you the wet look for such a short time, with no hold.</li>
            <li> This was the best \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair styling product. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t exist any more, and even if you find it, you&#x27;ll pay 4-5 times the original price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, if you put too much, it would make the hair too stiff when dry. However it would still look wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a classic case of bad market research, a company discontinuing a successful product and keeping in its product line dozens of other obscure/useless/non-competitive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any idea which other product comes close and is available, please let know :)</li>
            <li> How is this stuff not sold in stores anymore?&lt;br /&gt;Takes me back to the day, still love this great product.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again.  Ordering was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It added a nice little curl to my natural/processed hair.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great product</li>
            <li> this product works wonders on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry. i wash my hair and put this in and it curls my hair like it grew out of my scout that way. the only problem is that it way too expensive and the way i use it at this rate it will be gone with 2 weeks or a little more.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what this is I was sent but the packaging looks nothing like Paul Sebastian products.  The bottle does not look as it does in this picture as when I used to purchase in the store as well.  Not sure if I truly have PS product or not. Used it once and the gel seemed a little more watered down than the product Im used to thus I had to use more for the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me to use on natural hair as well as relaxed hair to create curls. I found that this product is very good but not meant for type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! The generic brand (GVP) does not compare!</li>
            <li> The Sebastian name is now a property of Procter &amp; Gamble. \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; styling gel is long gone. Before it was completely gone, I bought a crate of it. Now, I&#x27;m starting to run out so I have experimented with many other products. Many bottles of gel wound up in the trash can. I&#x27;ve finally found a solution that works. It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but it&#x27;s close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Marix Biolage Gelle and mix it 50%-50% with water.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CMLHAQ/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting solution is very similar to \\&quot;Wet.\\&quot; It&#x27;s has a little bit stronger hold. If you find it too strong, just add some more water or use a little less. It&#x27;s been working well for me and I&#x27;m relieved to find a permanent replacement for the discontinued \\&quot;Wet.\\&quot;  ...At least until Matrix is gobbled up by some big company that discontinues it as well. :-/</li>
            <li> Provides good control for my curly hair. It also makes my hair very shiny. Will buy more if it remains available.</li>
            <li> I loved Wet!  It was da bomb, but I&#x27;m not feeling the 40 some dollars to purchase it.  I&#x27;ll find something else.  Why Paul Mitchell discontinued this very popular product is beyond me.  It sucks😩</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago and loved it.  I am considering a new cut that this would be perfect for...until I saw the price!!  OMG...do you people really pay $60 for hair gel?  Way out of my budget/comfort level.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Wet, use it for years.</li>
            <li> This product is great in all types of hair. It makes your hair look really wet and curly all day.</li>
