            <li>None of us has experienced a sunburn when using this product ages 2-45 years.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get great coverage with both</li>
            <li>Sunscreen works great but the spray doesn&#x27;t work like I would want.</li>
            <li>Also, the lock button on the pump is a nice feature, since my kids both try to &#x27;help&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>This is the best of the many zinc sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have skin so fair that it is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the pump, the product itself is good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub in that good.</li>
            <li>would not have been good.  </li>
            <li>Great all purpose sunscreen for any outdoor activity, doesn&#x27;t stink and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>Still a good product but not sporting the ease of use that the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; stuff in the drug store boasts.</li>
            <li>This was perfect AND in a spray bottle which I was so excited about....</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using it on my toddler who is very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are great, no nasty toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen &amp; am happy I purchased 2.  </li>
            <li>Does not have a strong smell which is great in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It provided great protection, and I did not get burned at all, although I get burned easily.</li>
            <li>kind\\&quot;, people always want that as opposed to the tube kind.</li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a baby&#x27;s product, I have not applied it to any children, I got it just for my own use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural, which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>and I love that you can lock it to prevent leaks.</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes in a convenient spray.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>We absolutely love this sunblock.  </li>
            <li>very deceiving!!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this sunscreen, easy to apply and keeps the kiddos protected.</li>
            <li>Because its a liquid lotion its easy to apply and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li>It pumps into your hands for easy application.</li>
            <li>It worked fine on my neck--</li>
            <li>light cream like solution in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>, that is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several Aubrey Organics products and have been happy with them.</li>
            <li>Aubrey got good ratings on EWG as far as I know.</li>
            <li>But, she hadn&#x27;t put any on her legs, and they were bright red.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ok with that, doesnt really matter.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t have tons of garbage in it that shouldn&#x27;t really be used on skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the adult version is better?  </li>
            <li>After using it a lot for a whole summer the bottle still seems pretty full.</li>
            <li>even though it is not a true spray, my sons like this sunscreen better than others because it is easy to apply and rubs in well</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really spray !</li>
            <li>We are on our third bottle now and love everything except the sprayer.</li>
            <li>have respiratory problems with any sort of chemical off-gassing, fragrance and most essential oils, and this does not irritate me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to.</li>
            <li>First, I think the listing for this product needs some work.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is more liquid than many of the other natural sunscreens but the spray bottle could use some work.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really use it as a spray, I have to spray it in my hands then rub it in.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, my daughter hasn&#x27;t burned yet.  </li>
            <li>This soaked in within moments, leaving a silky emollient  film on my skin (very pampering).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I much prefer this sunblock.</li>
            <li>The only downside is being that it doesn&#x27;t have the additives that others have it doesn&#x27;t rub in as easily and its a little more &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34;, however its manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the difference in this dispenser over a flip top or a push down handle.</li>
            <li>However one of our family members got sunburn on the top half part of the body after going to beach.</li>
            <li>It was my main reason for picking this product, and now I also like it for the protection it provides.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li>My biggest gripe is that I ordered the spray and got a normal bottle.</li>
            <li>Good, but not great.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to see that there finally is a lotion style sunscreen with only mineral active ingredients</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to do for my kids and less time.</li>
            <li>I always apply before getting in the sun and reapply after swimming and so far no burns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to so much stuff (especially chemical sunscreens)</li>
            <li>My daughter does have sensitive skin, so we stick with naturals for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I tried to rub it in, it still stayed white.</li>
            <li>It IS more watery as a spray coming out of the pump than the tube ones, but that makes it easier and faster to spread than the pastes, which are always quite thick.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also super pale</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works great but the pump on the bottle is bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale anyway, but that took it to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>I kinda assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be EXACTLY the same consistency as other products being that I was trying to avoid that to begin with.</li>
            <li>High quality, but really high price for such a small bottle.</li>

            <li> I kinda assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be EXACTLY the same consistency as other products being that I was trying to avoid that to begin with.</li>
            <li> High quality, but really high price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Note, it is a hand pump action spray, not aerosol like the other spray sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a dark skin and this looks very white on my skin and the color stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> It is VERY white, and will leave a white layer on your skin, even when you rub it in until it is dry.  </li>
            <li> but I was a little surprised to not receive the item I ordered</li>
            <li> I chose this sunscreen because of the EWG recommendations, it worked well as long as you reapplied every two hours</li>
            <li> It also stays on for so long, even while swimming!</li>
            <li> Reapplication is necessary, perhaps sooner than other brands.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a little bit of a white appearance -</li>
            <li> However this one falls a little short.</li>
            <li> We have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the rest of this on my kids, no one cares if they look extra pale, but I won&#x27;t be using it on myself anymore.</li>
            <li> She spent 3 or 4 hours in the sun the other day and didn&#x27;t get burnt at all where she had put sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> I never heard back from the company about replacing my defective bottle  which I cannot use and wasted my money for a year ago !     </li>
            <li> I bought this product because it doesn&#x27;t have the additional chemicals that other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very spreadable, compared to other natural sunscreens, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> It does have a white cast to it which I am not thrilled about.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work for short periods, but this stuff is is so thick it won&#x27;t spray on or rub in well.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick so harder to rub in and tends to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Desperately looked and searched for a natural sunscreen last summer to protect my kids at the beach and the pool with out poisoning them.</li>
            <li> Not a true spray as one would hope.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience a skin reaction from this, as I have in the past with other SPF products.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle does make application a little easier, and it did protect me from getting sunburned at the beach.</li>
            <li> Either way it got the job done, it was just a little messy and a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> So when the bottle leaked all over our beach bag I was a bit upset at the waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recently misplaced our bottle for him and had to use California Baby to go out and play.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in which defeats the purpose a bit, but it&#x27;s thin enough</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t spray the spray nozzle is missing!    </li>
            <li> this does not spray a mist, as I had expected, it is a thin lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually like the Aubrey sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> Not sure there is any way around this with the zinc oxide in the product.</li>
            <li> It just squirts out thick lotion, not a fine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my biggest complaint would be the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick like all sunscreens.</li>
            <li> the spray is also not good and its like diluted lotion that you have to rub again on the skin</li>
            <li> and I realize it&#x27;s completely broken</li>
            <li> so i was not happy ....</li>
            <li> Just spray it into your hands and rub on a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I was about to go ref a soccer game...</li>
            <li> and she ended up with a serious sunburn!</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken upon arrival and can&#x27;t be used!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased it for the spray factor so hence the disappointment.</li>
            <li> My kids hate it.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen made me and my kids break out in an AWFUL rash.  </li>

            <li> This sunscreen works great and keeps my fair-skinned wife from getting sunburned. She spent 3 or 4 hours in the sun the other day and didn&#x27;t get burnt at all where she had put sunscreen on. But, she hadn&#x27;t put any on her legs, and they were bright red. Stuff works. And it&#x27;s the \\&quot;spray kind\\&quot;, people always want that as opposed to the tube kind.</li>
            <li> Watery and did not lastmore than 30 min</li>
            <li> This is a great product, does the job and lasts forever. I always apply before getting in the sun and reapply after swimming and so far no burns. After using it a lot for a whole summer the bottle still seems pretty full. The spray works great even after being used by kids and I love that you can lock it to prevent leaks. Because its a liquid lotion its easy to apply and spreads evenly. Aubrey got good ratings on EWG as far as I know.</li>
            <li> Desperately looked and searched for a natural sunscreen last summer to protect my kids at the beach and the pool with out poisoning them. This was perfect AND in a spray bottle which I was so excited about.... But it doesn&#x27;t really spray ! It&#x27;s a cream that squirts out. Either way it got the job done, it was just a little messy and a bit pricey. So when the bottle leaked all over our beach bag I was a bit upset at the waste of money.</li>
            <li> light cream like solution in a spray bottle.  Very easy to apply.  Goes on and stays on.  Does not have a strong smell which is great in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really use it as a spray, I have to spray it in my hands then rub it in.  It works really well, my daughter hasn&#x27;t burned yet.  I had a second bottle on had as well and my husband took it to keep on his boat for himself.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen, easy to apply and keeps the kiddos protected.</li>
            <li> BIG fan of this sunscreen! We are on our third bottle now and love everything except the sprayer. Excellent protection! None of us has experienced a sunburn when using this product ages 2-45 years. It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> excellent non-toxic product for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> I took this sunscreen on a 3 day canoeing trip and it totally saved me! It provided great protection, and I did not get burned at all, although I get burned easily. The ingredients are great, no nasty toxic chemicals. It was my main reason for picking this product, and now I also like it for the protection it provides.</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp; got the baby organically spray instead. I think the web page is messed up. I don&#x27;t have time to send back so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken upon arrival and can&#x27;t be used! I just opened it so that I could use it this summer and I realize it&#x27;s completely broken and it won&#x27;t spray the spray nozzle is missing!    **Update- I never heard back from the company about replacing my defective bottle  which I cannot use and wasted my money for a year ago !     [...]</li>
            <li> I just now received this product and applied some to my arms.  I am delighted to see that there finally is a lotion style sunscreen with only mineral active ingredients, that is fragrance free.  Note: this does not spray a mist, as I had expected, it is a thin lotion. You need to spread it with your hands once you spray it on.  Even though it is a baby&#x27;s product, I have not applied it to any children, I got it just for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have respiratory problems with any sort of chemical off-gassing, fragrance and most essential oils, and this does not irritate me.  It is a little oily - but I use oils instead of synthetic moisturizers on my skin anyway.  This soaked in within moments, leaving a silky emollient  film on my skin (very pampering). It leaves a little bit of a white appearance - I have skin so fair that it is not a problem. But people with richer colored skin may be bothered by this.</li>
            <li> Arrived exploded in the box.</li>
            <li> After a ton if research I ordered this item but when it arrived it was the baby version.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same formula but I was a little surprised to not receive the item I ordered and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and they sent me a spray for kids.... Not the one in the picture so i was not happy .... very deceiving!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a spray.  It just squirts out thick lotion, not a fine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was the only one I could get that was unscented.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it doesn&#x27;t have the additional chemicals that other sunscreens do. I also love that it comes in a convenient spray. The only downside is being that it doesn&#x27;t have the additives that others have it doesn&#x27;t rub in as easily and its a little more &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34;, however its manageable. I kinda assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be EXACTLY the same consistency as other products being that I was trying to avoid that to begin with. I love it and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive the child product even though that is not in the description of the product and all I&#x27;m seeing is the orange &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; label. It has the same ingredients so I&#x27;m ok with that, doesnt really matter.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen. It sprays on and rubs in perfectly. It also stays on for so long, even while swimming!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the pump, the product itself is good. The sunscreen works great but the pump on the bottle is bad.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this sunblock.  I feel comfortable using it on my toddler who is very fair skinned.  We travel quite a bit with him to the Caribbean and have had no problems with this sunblock. I recently misplaced our bottle for him and had to use California Baby to go out and play. I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I much prefer this sunblock. I feel like I get great coverage with both but Aubrey goes on so easily!!!</li>
            <li> even though it is not a true spray, my sons like this sunscreen better than others because it is easy to apply and rubs in well</li>
            <li> This stuff is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to. I&#x27;m allergic to so much stuff (especially chemical sunscreens) but I&#x27;m also super pale so I need sunscreen. It also doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you&#x27;ve applied white war paint like some of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sunscreens. The one thing you should know, don&#x27;t bother trying to spray it on like a mist. Just spray it into your hands and rub on a thin layer. I don&#x27;t know why it comes in a spray bottle, it doesn&#x27;t work like that, but it doesn&#x27;t matter what packaging it&#x27;s in; I finally found a product I like that likes me back so I can protect myself from the sun.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work for short periods, but this stuff is is so thick it won&#x27;t spray on or rub in well. We actually have to spray it in our hands (streams out) and then rub it on. My kids hate it. It&#x27;s itchy and peels off if you get scraped in the water. My kids also did not like the smell or the feel of this product on their skin. We wil NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Awful. Bought this for my niece and she ended up with a serious sunburn! Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Rubs on chalky and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in that good.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen &amp; am happy I purchased 2.  It pumps into your hands for easy application. (unlike the squirt bottles which can dump a quarter of the bottle into your hands!  Also, the lock button on the pump is a nice feature, since my kids both try to &#x27;help&#x27;!  ) There&#x27;s no overbearing sunscreen-smell, which is great!  PLUS it&#x27;s all natural, which is awesome!  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t have tons of garbage in it that shouldn&#x27;t really be used on skin.  Reapplication is necessary, perhaps sooner than other brands.  High quality, but really high price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the many zinc sunscreens I have tried.  It IS more watery as a spray coming out of the pump than the tube ones, but that makes it easier and faster to spread than the pastes, which are always quite thick.  I use this on the kids&#x27; bodies and the Alba zinc tube sunscreen for their faces.  Note, it is a hand pump action spray, not aerosol like the other spray sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I chose this sunscreen because of the EWG recommendations, it worked well as long as you reapplied every two hours but it is NOT water resistant at all.  I applied it to my feet at the beach, walked in the water for a brief moment and ended up sunburned on my feet.  I like the fact that it is more liquid than many of the other natural sunscreens but the spray bottle could use some work.  When you spray it, it flings tiny droplets out to the sides...so if you&#x27;re spraying an arm or leg, it goes all over the floor.  The nozzle also collects the sprayed sunscreen causing it to drip.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat Aubrey</li>
            <li> I usually like the Aubrey sunscreen products. My daughter does have sensitive skin, so we stick with naturals for sensitive skin. I applied this to her, and she broke out in a blotchy red rash before even going in the sun.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen made me and my kids break out in an AWFUL rash.  Maybe it was just a personal reaction but I had to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I thought this is spray type but this thing comes out like pumping lotion (thick)&lt;br /&gt;I tried to spray it my son&#x27;s neck and it came out chunk and lay on his chest area on the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;We had to change his clothes. We will just use it.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a dark skin and this looks very white on my skin and the color stays on for a while. the spray is also not good and its like diluted lotion that you have to rub again on the skin</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in which defeats the purpose a bit, but it&#x27;s thin enough it&#x27;s easy to do for my kids and less time. I have 4 kids to lather up so saving time with the spray helps.</li>
            <li> First, I think the listing for this product needs some work.  The title doesn&#x27;t say it is the &#x27;kids&#x27; version, but the picture DOES, and that is what I received.  Perhaps the adult version is better?  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very spreadable, compared to other natural sunscreens, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  As for it being &#x27;sprayable&#x27;...it&#x27;s not.  I had to spray it into my hand and then rub onto my skin from there.  It is VERY white, and will leave a white layer on your skin, even when you rub it in until it is dry.  It made me look like a vampire when I put it on my face.  Thank goodness I was at home when I did it so I could wash it off.  I was about to go ref a soccer game...would not have been good.  I&#x27;m pale anyway, but that took it to a whole new level.  I didn&#x27;t want to scare the kids!  It worked fine on my neck--I didn&#x27;t get a burn--but you could tell I&#x27;d put sunblock on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the rest of this on my kids, no one cares if they look extra pale, but I won&#x27;t be using it on myself anymore.</li>
            <li> We have only used it a few times. It does have a white cast to it which I am not thrilled about. But my biggest complaint would be the dispenser. I was expecting a spray like it states in the name but it actually &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; the lotion. You still have to rub and spread it on the skin. I don&#x27;t see the difference in this dispenser over a flip top or a push down handle. I specifically purchased it for the spray factor so hence the disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great all purpose sunscreen for any outdoor activity, doesn&#x27;t stink and rubs in nice.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works great but the spray doesn&#x27;t work like I would want. It only sprays in a stream and defeats the purpose of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick so harder to rub in and tends to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen.  Doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel.  Works well.  I don&#x27;t experience a skin reaction from this, as I have in the past with other SPF products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Aubrey Organics products and have been happy with them. However this one falls a little short. The spray bottle does make application a little easier, and it did protect me from getting sunburned at the beach. The big downside is that it will turn you white. Especially if you have hair on your arms or legs. No matter how much I tried to rub it in, it still stayed white. Not sure there is any way around this with the zinc oxide in the product. Good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick like all sunscreens. Doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s skin. My biggest gripe is that I ordered the spray and got a normal bottle. Since I had ordered a couple sunscreens, I didn&#x27;t realize that the one I was opening was supposed to be the spray so cannot return.</li>
            <li> Feels good. However one of our family members got sunburn on the top half part of the body after going to beach.</li>
            <li> A very good sunscreen. No odor at all. Comes out in a stream of white cream. Not a true spray as one would hope. Still a good product but not sporting the ease of use that the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; stuff in the drug store boasts. I&#x27;ll still get it but it will be much harder to drag my nearly albino spouse away from his old standby of BullFrog.</li>
