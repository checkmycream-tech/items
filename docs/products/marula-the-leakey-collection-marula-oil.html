            <li>Love it for cuticles and feet too.</li>
            <li>Best facial product ive ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>We tried many over the counter lotions and oils.</li>
            <li>Some worked better than others.</li>
            <li>When I bought it, I was impressed with the fact that the labeling/packaging indicated that its sole ingredient was 100% Marula Oil.  </li>
            <li>it was not 100% Marula Oil but a blend of many oils.  </li>
            <li>Best facial oil I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to friends who also love this product.</li>
            <li>I began using this as part of my evening regimen a couple of weeks ago and am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>This happened more than once, but after avoiding my chin, the problem disappeared.  </li>
            <li>The best facial oil I&#x27;ve ever bought and used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best solution for scars left after my foot surgery.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin in particular.</li>
            <li>I apply this oil both morning and evening to my dry skin and the results are excellent</li>
            <li>Oil Absorbed nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: for fair balance, the Leaky Collection offers employment opportunities for the men and women of Kenya - you can learn more about their mission and work in Kenya at:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure whether I&#x27;ll be able to continue using the oil during the summer months, but there are several more months of winter during which it will be put to good use.</li>
            <li>My fine lines were diminished.</li>
            <li>Fine lines/wrinkles???</li>
            <li>She already has great skin though and my skin is much more dry than hers is.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in your complexion.  </li>
            <li>Great product will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love the way this oil gets absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin never looks oily or shiny and the oils just soak in and give a very fresh look.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this oil at Sephora, but felt inclined to write a review mainly because it&#x27;s awesome, but also because I come here to read reviews whether I buy through amazon or not.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>As I get older (currently 50)...and continue to  be outside a lot gardening, sailing, biking etc....always looking for the best, natural product for my face to treat it as best</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>This oil is light but effective at keeping my skin soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li>Very nice for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell is wonderful (and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells--I usually dislike most fragrances).  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly leaves skin feeling moist.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the long-term benefits because I just started using this this month, but in the short term, it makes skin look so nice: fresh, smooth, moisturized and youthful.</li>
            <li>This product feels healing when you first rub it on, leaving skin appearing to be more glowing, giving even-wintered skin a certain luminosity.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and easy to be absorbed .</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>love knowing that I am helping the aging process with this natural product  Marula Oil.</li>
            <li>Liked that some money from sales goes to the African women, where product comes from.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>http://www.leakeycollection.com/faq&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very supportive of products that help others less fortunate to make a living</li>
            <li>so I will reconsider buying the Leaky Collection brand as opposed to buying the cheaper product just for the reason that they are helping Kenyans to make a living with a product  that grows right in their back-yards.</li>
            <li>I think regular use of facial oils (good sunglasses and appropriate SPF) might actually eliminate the need for Botox!! :)</li>
            <li>Thus far, this product has been accurately described as referenced by reviewers.</li>
            <li>I would feel better about paying this amount if I knew how much actually goes to the women.</li>
            <li>did some research on it at first  </li>
            <li>The morning after I first tried this oil</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I love the bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>The Marula oil is by far, better than many other oils like grapeseed and Argan.</li>
            <li>Not worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for something other than a nice smell and rich feel!!</li>
            <li>With their very cool dropper, I use one drop at night, and two drops in the morning -- one after toner, on my face and up my neck, then one mixed with my foundation that contains SPF.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely nothing positive about this oil ... not the price, not the quality, nothing.  </li>
            <li>the other hand is the price is kind of high</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li>If u have normal-dry skin it really helps to moistureize it.</li>
            <li>This product really helps.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Lasts about 1 month w whole dropper.</li>
            <li>; I cannot really tell if it tightens like stated</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and gives the skin a much needed glow.</li>
            <li>Very high-quality.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a month now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and not greasy enough to use it as a primer for under your make-up as well.</li>
            <li>only other comment I have is that the Leaky Collection  product is way over priced; you can buy the 100% cold-pressed Marula Nut Oil for much cheaper from Shea Butter company (here on Amazon) and its just as good.</li>
            <li>Even though I think this bottle will last me quite awhile, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product for the long haul!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Marula oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but leaves my face feeling and looking hydrated and fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into your skin and keeps your sking hydrated for a long time.  </li>
            <li>To this day, Marula Oil is still a staple in my toiletry bag and the one product I don&#x27;t want to live without but it will not be Leakey Marula Oil.</li>
            <li>My foundation actually goes on silkier and yet light at the same time.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (even all natural aloe makes me break out), but this oil works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I,would highly reccomend this to anyone with skin issues or in general caring for their skin.</li>
            <li>My 26 year old daughter had me try it</li>
            <li>My mother in law gave us a bottle of this marula oil, and I have to admit I was surprised how well this oil works.</li>
            <li>and I use it every night; particularly near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>My skin is prone to breakouts, and this did not cause any acne so far (wearing 3 days now).  </li>
            <li>I recently got too much sun on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to research further and try numerous other Marula Oils and have found much better versions.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, is easily absorbed and has actually healed a couple of minor spots and scar tissue.  </li>
            <li>I always had oily skin and after a certain age it seemed it turned dry overnight.</li>
            <li>It seems to be helping clear up the red patches.  </li>
            <li>I later saw it advertised in the Soft Surroundings catalog/</li>
            <li>I noticed that my wrinkles had relaxed a bit--less apparent.  </li>
            <li>You need very little, it absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily residue on my pillow...</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the product as a Fall/Winter moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy yet rich enough to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>and I do think that it is a worth while product for those who need a little extra hydration.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old, so it did not make me break out because I have dry skin now.</li>

            <li> The Marula oil is by far, better than many other oils like grapeseed and Argan.</li>
            <li> Not worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for something other than a nice smell and rich feel!!</li>
            <li> With their very cool dropper, I use one drop at night, and two drops in the morning -- one after toner, on my face and up my neck, then one mixed with my foundation that contains SPF.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely nothing positive about this oil ... not the price, not the quality, nothing.  </li>
            <li> the other hand is the price is kind of high</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> If u have normal-dry skin it really helps to moistureize it.</li>
            <li> This product really helps.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 1 month w whole dropper.</li>
            <li> ; I cannot really tell if it tightens like stated</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and gives the skin a much needed glow.</li>
            <li> Very high-quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not greasy enough to use it as a primer for under your make-up as well.</li>
            <li> only other comment I have is that the Leaky Collection  product is way over priced; you can buy the 100% cold-pressed Marula Nut Oil for much cheaper from Shea Butter company (here on Amazon) and its just as good.</li>
            <li> Even though I think this bottle will last me quite awhile, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product for the long haul!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Marula oil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but leaves my face feeling and looking hydrated and fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into your skin and keeps your sking hydrated for a long time.  </li>
            <li> To this day, Marula Oil is still a staple in my toiletry bag and the one product I don&#x27;t want to live without but it will not be Leakey Marula Oil.</li>
            <li> My foundation actually goes on silkier and yet light at the same time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (even all natural aloe makes me break out), but this oil works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I,would highly reccomend this to anyone with skin issues or in general caring for their skin.</li>
            <li> My 26 year old daughter had me try it</li>
            <li> My mother in law gave us a bottle of this marula oil, and I have to admit I was surprised how well this oil works.</li>
            <li> and I use it every night; particularly near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakouts, and this did not cause any acne so far (wearing 3 days now).  </li>
            <li> I recently got too much sun on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to research further and try numerous other Marula Oils and have found much better versions.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, is easily absorbed and has actually healed a couple of minor spots and scar tissue.  </li>
            <li> I always had oily skin and after a certain age it seemed it turned dry overnight.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping clear up the red patches.  </li>
            <li> I later saw it advertised in the Soft Surroundings catalog/</li>
            <li> I noticed that my wrinkles had relaxed a bit--less apparent.  </li>
            <li> You need very little, it absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily residue on my pillow...</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the product as a Fall/Winter moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy yet rich enough to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> and I do think that it is a worth while product for those who need a little extra hydration.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old, so it did not make me break out because I have dry skin now.</li>
            <li> I think it has a little plumping action rather than actually &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the product is natural and not full of parabens and mineral oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> highly recommend for dull, dry skin or for trying it with skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had dry or chapped lips</li>
            <li> Recommend for everyone who has oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was itching and dry and lotions were not working.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago when I was cleaning and greening my toiletry products and just starting my journey into oils.  </li>
            <li> Do suggest using only half of dropper if using everyday so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My face usually needs an extra boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little bit of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford to use it on other</li>
            <li> This oil heals any acne faster than Clearasil or any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, no residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any serious acne issues - but the monthly occasional flare up.  </li>
            <li> so you can use less.</li>
            <li> could be little cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and decided to apply a little there.  </li>
            <li> Use just a few drops on face and neck.</li>
            <li> plus is when I dab it round the eye area it does not irritate the eye itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not like the feeling of heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I was so dissappointed, and it was not cheap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cold, dry winter, even here in Florida.  </li>
            <li> all this icy cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars just because it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very faint and citrus-like.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have just started to use this product so I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet. But, I am still waiting for the good, citrus smell mentioned by some reviewers.  The bottle I got smells more like used motor oil!  Guess I&#x27;ll wait to see if it works before I dump it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It feels and smells wonderful.  The oil soaks in nicely and my skin is glowing and healthy. Wish I could buy it by the gallon!</li>
            <li> This product feels healing when you first rub it on, leaving skin appearing to be more glowing, giving even-wintered skin a certain luminosity.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  It quickly absorbs into your skin and keeps your sking hydrated for a long time.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, very moisturizing, absorbs well. Love it for cuticles and feet too. It&#x27;s quite pricey but works well. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 year now.  I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation when wearing it.  Here&#x27;s to African Oil!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing that I am helping the aging process with this natural product  Marula Oil. My 26 year old daughter had me try it and now my mother is even using it! Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely purchase again. I saw a noticeably difference in my skin. My fine lines were diminished. Oil Absorbed nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice for winter dry skin. Use just a few drops on face and neck. Absorbs quickly leaves skin feeling moist.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. It works and it smells nice. It is pricey. Liked that some money from sales goes to the African women, where product comes from. I was there and know they can use any help. I would feel better about paying this amount if I knew how much actually goes to the women.</li>
            <li> If u have normal-dry skin it really helps to moistureize it. My face usually needs an extra boost of moisture. This product really helps. Fine lines/wrinkles??? I havent noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about six months now. I always had oily skin and after a certain age it seemed it turned dry overnight. This oil is light but effective at keeping my skin soft and moist all day. It also seems to prevent the intermittent eczema in my eyebrows. I use it all over my face, neck, and lips. I haven&#x27;t had dry or chapped lips all this icy cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for dull, dry skin or for trying it with skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I,would highly reccomend this to anyone with skin issues or in general caring for their skin. It is marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;I received it as a gift and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Recommend for everyone who has oily and dry skin. Best facial product ive ever purchased. Worth every penny. Do suggest using only half of dropper if using everyday so it lasts longer. Lasts about 1 month w whole dropper.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin clearing results, which is what I was hoping for. Not worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking for something other than a nice smell and rich feel!!</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and a little goes a long way!  I like the way my skin feels after using it; I cannot really tell if it tightens like stated but I have to admit, I have been getting quite a few compliments about my skin being so flawless and perfect.  Others sometimes see what we cannot.  With this in mind, I think it is working and I do think that it is a worth while product for those who need a little extra hydration.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I am so glad I bought it.  It was a great price  and it feels so good on y face</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my sister  and sister in law who had been wanting to try it but could not find it</li>
            <li> My husband has been on chemo for several years.  The treatments has been causing severe dryness and cracking to the bottom of his feet. We tried many over the counter lotions and oils. Some worked better than others. My mother in law gave us a bottle of this marula oil, and I have to admit I was surprised how well this oil works. A bit pricey, yes, but well worth it. A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this face oil!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago when I was cleaning and greening my toiletry products and just starting my journey into oils.  There was absolutely nothing positive about this oil ... not the price, not the quality, nothing.  When I bought it, I was impressed with the fact that the labeling/packaging indicated that its sole ingredient was 100% Marula Oil.  I later saw it advertised in the Soft Surroundings catalog/they were offering it via their website as well HOWEVER their list of ingredients was substantially longer ... it was not 100% Marula Oil but a blend of many oils.  I don&#x27;t like being deceived; that alone was enough to drive me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to research further and try numerous other Marula Oils and have found much better versions.  The bonus?  Cheaper too!  To this day, Marula Oil is still a staple in my toiletry bag and the one product I don&#x27;t want to live without but it will not be Leakey Marula Oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cold, dry winter, even here in Florida.  My skin was itching and dry and lotions were not working.  But oil on my face that has combination skin seemed like an invitation for a breakout.  No so!  This stuff is great and I use it every night; particularly near my eyes.  And I&#x27;m scheduled for a laser facial next week and I&#x27;m confident that this stuff will improve and speed the healing process!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Marula oil.  It makes a huge difference in your complexion.  My face has lost all of its dryness and looks terrific.</li>
            <li> Marula oil is very nice!  A bit pricey, however feels great on my face.  I definitely recommend the product as a Fall/Winter moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy yet rich enough to do the trick.  I also like the fact that the product is natural and not full of parabens and mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying MY bottle!!  The dropper applicator keeps the contents from becoming contaminated, as well!</li>
            <li> Thus far, this product has been accurately described as referenced by reviewers. It is not greasy and gives the skin a much needed glow. No doubt about it I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months, very light not greasy.  I use it with my moisturizer, my skin just feels more hydrated!!</li>
            <li> Best facial oil I&#x27;ve tried.  This is my  fourth bottle. Absorbs quickly, no residue. Recommended to friends who also love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great I heard of the fruit of Marula did some research on it at first  but then i was reading on how good its for the skin so I decided try it out I have to say it works good it makes my skin feel smooth and gives a smooth feeling and it has a pleasant smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand is the price is kind of high could be little cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who want to have nice skin.</li>
            <li> The best oil ever. No more breakouts since I started using this. Light but moisturizing. Very high-quality. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> The morning after I first tried this oil I noticed that my wrinkles had relaxed a bit--less apparent.  My teenage daughter did too.  Later that night, I was back to before, so I think it has a little plumping action rather than actually &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; wrinkles.  My skin is prone to breakouts, and this did not cause any acne so far (wearing 3 days now).  The light smell is also very appealing. It&#x27;s very faint and citrus-like.</li>
            <li> This oil nourishes my skin.  It is not greasy, is easily absorbed and has actually healed a couple of minor spots and scar tissue.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (even all natural aloe makes me break out), but this oil works like a charm. It calms and moisturizes my skin, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it absorbs quickly and easily.  Additionally, the smell is wonderful (and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells--I usually dislike most fragrances).  Just remember, a little bit of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love it!  I will definitely order more! The oil soaks into my skin and makes my makeup application a dream.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift from my sister that uses it and loves it. She already has great skin though and my skin is much more dry than hers is. I have been using it for over a month now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin. Also, it does not moisturize my skin as well as Jojoba oil which is WAY cheaper! The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I love the bottle it comes in. I&#x27;m trying to use it all up so I can transfer my jojoba oil into it ha ha.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil both morning and evening to my dry skin and the results are excellent&lt;br /&gt;A super plus is when I dab it round the eye area it does not irritate the eye itself.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived protected by bubble wrap in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reluctant to use oil on my face, but after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try.  I began using this as part of my evening regimen a couple of weeks ago and am quite pleased.  The only issue is that using it on my chin caused breakouts.  This happened more than once, but after avoiding my chin, the problem disappeared.  You need very little, it absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily residue on my pillow... all good things.  I have eczema on my hands and decided to apply a little there.  It seems to be helping clear up the red patches.  I&#x27;m unsure whether I&#x27;ll be able to continue using the oil during the summer months, but there are several more months of winter during which it will be put to good use.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil gets absorbed into my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy as all but feels great on</li>
            <li> The best facial oil I&#x27;ve ever bought and used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and easy to be absorbed . Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I loved it. Will keep using it for a long time. Great for my skin in particular. Price was great</li>
            <li> This is the best solution for scars left after my foot surgery. I wish I could afford to use it on other areas.&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
            <li> As I get older (currently 50)...and continue to  be outside a lot gardening, sailing, biking etc....always looking for the best, natural product for my face to treat it as best I can.  Until my face no longer loves this product - it is the ONLY thing I use on my face as a moisturizer and for blemish control....YES I said blemish control.  I&#x27;ve never had any serious acne issues - but the monthly occasional flare up.  This oil heals any acne faster than Clearasil or any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;m hooked.  Absorbs nicely and no oily feel.</li>
            <li> I rotate between 6-7 facial oils to keep my skin from getting used to them; I just mix 2-3 drops of the oil into my regular moisturizer, and then continue on with my routine. My skin never looks oily or shiny and the oils just soak in and give a very fresh look. I think regular use of facial oils (good sunglasses and appropriate SPF) might actually eliminate the need for Botox!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other comment I have is that the Leaky Collection  product is way over priced; you can buy the 100% cold-pressed Marula Nut Oil for much cheaper from Shea Butter company (here on Amazon) and its just as good. The Marula oil is by far, better than many other oils like grapeseed and Argan. (I believe the Marula oil may have the heighest amount of antioxidants). And it&#x27;s a heavier oil so you can use less. Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: for fair balance, the Leaky Collection offers employment opportunities for the men and women of Kenya - you can learn more about their mission and work in Kenya at: http://www.leakeycollection.com/faq&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very supportive of products that help others less fortunate to make a living so I will reconsider buying the Leaky Collection brand as opposed to buying the cheaper product just for the reason that they are helping Kenyans to make a living with a product  that grows right in their back-yards.</li>
            <li> I do not recomend putting it on the face, mine broke out.....I was so dissappointed, and it was not cheap!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this oil at Sephora, but felt inclined to write a review mainly because it&#x27;s awesome, but also because I come here to read reviews whether I buy through amazon or not. I was convinced to give this a try because they also advertised that it reduces pore size. And after a month of use, I can indeed say that it did! My pores are visibly smaller. With their very cool dropper, I use one drop at night, and two drops in the morning -- one after toner, on my face and up my neck, then one mixed with my foundation that contains SPF. I am loving this routine. My foundation actually goes on silkier and yet light at the same time. I do not like the feeling of heavy foundation. It&#x27;s not at all greasy, but leaves my face feeling and looking hydrated and fresh throughout the entire day. It smells great, too. I have combination skin and am approaching 40 in a couple years. This is definitely worth the purchase! Even though I think this bottle will last me quite awhile, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product for the long haul! With all of its benefits, I&#x27;m eager to see how my skin will look after months of use.</li>
            <li> Expensive so I waited a while before splurging on it. I am glad I did. I recently got too much sun on my face. The oil was soothing &amp; helped repair my skin. It lasts a long time but I think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night as a finishing oil after my nightly facial routine. It is smooth and not greasy enough to use it as a primer for under your make-up as well. I have VERY dry skin and this oil is long-lasting and works great.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good and absorbs beautifully. I am 47 years old, so it did not make me break out because I have dry skin now. I can&#x27;t attest to the long-term benefits because I just started using this this month, but in the short term, it makes skin look so nice: fresh, smooth, moisturized and youthful. I love it. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars just because it is so expensive.</li>
