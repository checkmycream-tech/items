            <li>Very nice aroma, my husband likes it after he shaves.</li>

            <li>I used this brand before, in rose petal &amp; lavender and cucumber is also very good.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s not drying at all and the cucumber smell is quite pleasant.</li>

            <li>Great product great company...to many words</li>
            <li>It keeps my face bright and toned and keeps the oil in check.</li>

            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>I soak it with compressed masks, it works good.</li>
            <li>Great toner for your skin and also an awesome salad dressing spritzer on a hot summer day.  </li>
            <li>While I like both products, I think I liked the Original Witch Hazel with Aloe the best.</li>
            <li>How wonderful this is if you experience hot flashes!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Smells and feels great, I no longer have to purchase from so called &amp;#34;kitchen cosmetic&amp;#34; businesses for this stuff which charge way more.</li>
            <li>I reeeally wanted to love this cucumber toner; it smells great</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this!  </li>
            <li>I love this face tonic !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and as it is really refreshing!</li>
            <li>Great product - I originally purchased the Rose Witch Hazel which I really loved.</li>
            <li>Thayers brand of witch hazel is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell like cucumber, but it&#x27;s not as bright and refreshing as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Found this from heyfranhey and her amazing youtube channel.</li>
            <li>This toner is amazing, its so calming and my skin is prone to redness.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it&#x27;s alcohol free (the one that I ordered was, anyway)</li>
            <li>I like cucumber over the rose and lavender.  </li>
            <li>I ORDERED THIS AND THE ROSE WATER, I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER, BUT BOTH ARE REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li>For some reason the rose leaves my skin tighter and brighter looking.</li>
            <li>some kind of medicine/sterile bandage type of smell combined).</li>
            <li>Feels so nice after using.</li>
            <li>great product great scent for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I have used the rose, lavender and cucumber one to date</li>
            <li>The cucumber aloe soothes so nicely</li>
            <li>but I found it doesn&#x27;t work as well for my skin as the rose one.</li>
            <li>Has a nice cucumber scent, but my skin just doesn&#x27;t look as nice with this.</li>
            <li>Will use it up and order the rose one.</li>
            <li>I also like the rose flavor - use that one in winter and the cucumber in summer.</li>
            <li>Nice toner that doesn&#x27;t sting when you apply to the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this and the rose scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Rose and the Lavender months ago.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I use the Rose one as well as the Lavender</li>
            <li>I gave this to a bunch of my friends for a Favorite Things themed Christmas party and EVERYONE loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice feel on the face after a shave, though can sometimes leave a sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Nice to keep in frig to close poors after cleansing.</li>
            <li>M Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz]]</li>
            <li>Now I would rate the rose one 5 stars because the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering the rose one instead.</li>
            <li>It does feel nice though.</li>
            <li>i like it, it nice to try.</li>
            <li>is nice.</li>
            <li>tried the rose petal?</li>
            <li>The cucumber smell is noticeable and I liked that.</li>
            <li>so this is a nice way to freshen up.</li>
            <li>so I bought clay and mix this with the clay and make my own mask</li>
            <li>I own a salon and have this on my backbar.</li>
            <li>I use this in place of a cream moisturizer after washing my face and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>and it feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with the rose.</li>
            <li>I prefer the rose.</li>
            <li>I tried also the rose one before, but I really like the cucumber the best!!!</li>
            <li>Great product and smells cucumbery fresh!</li>
            <li>This particular product, which includes cucumbers, works excellent.</li>
            <li>I usually love the Rose Petal, but find this is better for skin redness!</li>
            <li>All natural, great cucumber smell, no residue, feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li>Great seller and quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>The toner has a wonderful cooling sensation, as a cucumber toner should, and it has all natural ingredients without alcohol and paraben!  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the rose petal</li>
            <li>This one and the Rose one are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Works well, smells nice, refreshing</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cucumber and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best toner I have used so far~</li>
            <li>gladly order this again, it&#x27;s a nice product&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>but like the rose better.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft and awesome after applying it.  </li>
            <li>I love Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel, so I thought I&#x27;d try out the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my skin soo smooth!</li>
            <li>This product has a very nice scent - clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love  love love this product!</li>
            <li>I wonder if it&#x27;s because women have used more skin products all their life, so they are used to having nice skin; and we guys, for the most part do not, so we&#x27;re amazed at the change when we use this stuff?</li>
            <li>Gives good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>although, I love the scent of roses, I find the Rose Thayer&#x27;s to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and amazing!  </li>
            <li>Great to put on my face first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>The cucumber scent is very light, not over powering.</li>
            <li>The product is alcohol free which is important in order to avoid a stinging effect and the cucumber scent is amazing!</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and awesome product!</li>
            <li>Packaging was great -- it arrived in good shape and the product looked new and clean.</li>
            <li>Thayer has excellent toner - I especially love the Cucumber Witch Hazel as it is gentle on sensitive skin and very cooling.</li>
            <li>have HUGE boil-like zits all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better and the bags under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>However I love these toners and was put, so I decided to keep the bottle.</li>
            <li>Non drying and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li>So nice to find something that&#x27;s natural and a great value to boot.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and have tried a dozen or more toners designed for peps like me, but they almost always have alcohol.</li>
            <li>She love it.  </li>
            <li>I love to use these as toners in the summer.  </li>
            <li>They are cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love it:</li>
            <li>Pick this up in the summer, it might just be better than aloe.</li>
            <li>It  soothes and calms my skin and on top of that it&#x27;s not packed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used Thayer Witch Hazel products as an aftershave for many years.</li>
            <li>(otherwise it would look funny to have  nice looking skin on my throat and cheeks, but nowhere else!).  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This feels great but is not as much of an astringent as I am used to.  </li>
            <li>I had read that undistilled witch hazel has more anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients, there is more aloe vera than there is witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product  - recommended by HeyFranHey.com.  </li>
            <li>I love the cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li>the lemon one is better for acne prone and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel astringent.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the performance of Thayers witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Better than the lavender one</li>
            <li>this is my first foray into toner and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I just started to use it for a week or so, it&#x27;s not as &#x27;magical&#x27; as I thought ir would be.</li>
            <li>LOVE this Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and not flirting to the skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite .</li>
            <li>I use Konjac sponges to exfoliate and I notice that my toner does much better having exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing</li>
            <li>Love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>so I am glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>This is a great toner at very inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>not a fan of its scent, and I did&#x27;t see its effect on acne as many reviews here mentioned.</li>
            <li>This witch hazel is gentle and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Can reapply many times throughout the day to refresh.</li>
            <li>I love all the Thayer witch hazels.</li>
            <li>Love Witch Hazel and</li>
            <li>out there are too drying, which makes my skin over produce oil causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I like the refreshing feeling it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>Which happen to be my favorite fruit, so I don&#x27;t mind applying it.  </li>
            <li>And it is alcohol free, nice for my skin，the smell</li>
            <li>I love using this product after my morning shave to rinse my face.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After reading the many and varied uses for witch hazel (some of which include: heat rash, poison ivy, boils, insect bites, and as an astringent to shrink pores)</li>
            <li>My face dislikes being washed more than once a day</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>My skin texture is way more even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of the wonders of this stuff and am glad to have it as part of my postpartum care collection.</li>
            <li>Love that the witch hazel is potent in this...</li>
            <li>you will probably find this mixture overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that it will work OK as a toner, but I don&#x27;t like the aroma, what there is of it.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect facial toner.  </li>
            <li>and I love the look of it.</li>
            <li>Clients love the cucumber scent</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love Thayers products but</li>
            <li>It gives me a refreshing feeling and does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it.</li>
            <li>I love The Body Shop Tea a Tree toner, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I thought the cucumber scent would be refreshing.</li>
            <li>Before I bought, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the cucumber smell while I was imagining something chemical smell of cucumber.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent,</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what I&#x27;m supposed to use this for.  </li>
            <li>Love all of Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toners, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The cucumber is refreshing, calming and would work well for men, as well as women (me.) :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>The best facial toner ever!!!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean feeling and great scent</li>
            <li>Feels very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I originally tried Thayer&#x27;s rose scented toner because it was the cheapest.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no guarantee they&#x27;d have this scent over, say, the original kind.</li>
            <li>Love all Thayer toners, and this one is super refreshing!</li>
            <li>This product has a cool, refreshing feel, and a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps.</li>
            <li>I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and love the product!</li>
            <li>Anyway, it smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Although I loved the Rose Petal, this by far beats it!</li>
            <li>The cucumber is fine: I know many people consider it their favorite.</li>
            <li>Cheap, natural, and effective - this is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people who live in areas where the weather changes drastically between seasons.</li>
            <li>Great price, quality product, fast delivery, free delivery</li>
            <li>and it feels like water on my face, great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I love all the Thayer witch hazels but this one is especially nice due to soothing cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li>It is very sweet and cucumber smelly</li>
            <li>Very refreshing, thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a toner for nearly two months now, and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>The cucumber scent is refreshing, but light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>What I expected, an excellent product</li>
            <li>Great natural astringent.</li>
            <li>The alcohol free formula is also refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li>Great with my rosacea and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But I think this is a really good product it cleans up make up really well and hasn&#x27;t messed up my skin.</li>
            <li>I WAS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li>I needed to quickly get some more witch hazel, as I love its use as an astringent.</li>
            <li>In fact, we&#x27;re out now and my first order was cancelled, so I&#x27;m trying to find the fastest way to get more!  </li>
            <li>Also love how it smells of fresh cucumbers!</li>
            <li>My face feels so cool and refreshed after using this!</li>
            <li>Works okay, not as well as the original witch hazel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthier looking, more supple, the pores are clean.  </li>
            <li>Love the rose... but unless you REALLY and</li>
            <li>Was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li>the shipping was very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>It is very mild, and nourishing.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to control usage.  </li>
            <li>This product has a strong, acidic cucumber scent that some people may find off-putting.</li>
            <li>The cucumber smell is strong but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>A refreshing astringent that makes your face feel cool and renewed.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on high quality, natural and organic toners and this IS the best!!!  </li>
            <li>A fine product for the price.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this witch hazel and has noticeable differences in fine lines and his pores are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Smells great and is very gentle to older skin.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the Rose Witch Hazel, but I think the Cucumber one is better on my skin as I tend to have sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no question to it - when you add cucumber into the mix you&#x27;re left with a great product.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Lightly re-moisturize the skin</li>
            <li>I like this toner, but not as much as the rose scent.</li>
            <li>It heals and gives my skin a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the low price!</li>
            <li>This toner is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>It serves as a fantastic toner and I use it after washing my face, not even needing a moisturizer because it works so well</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the smell but the toner itself is absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s is a go-to product for me and this scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>And smells so light.</li>
            <li>I use Acne Free Terminator 10 on problem areas.</li>
            <li>I does feel fantastic on your skin after a shower - makes my face feel moisturized without any oil or lotions.</li>
            <li>This product is great after I come back from hiking</li>
            <li>Love the fresh cucumber smell.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has no artificial fragrance, and that it cleanses and soothes the skin.</li>
            <li>Really reasonably priced for the size of bottle and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this toner.  </li>
            <li>Great product I definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself as an alternative to my cheap T.N.Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel which I use as an aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li>This makes a great facial toner!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I also used this in a home made baby wipe solution (along with Diaper Lotion Potion concentrate), and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>The size was bigger than I was expecting which is great.</li>
            <li>It always feels refreshing and it locks natural moisture into your skin effectively.</li>
            <li>I regularly use (and love) Thayer Lavender Witch Hazel, but the reviews were so good about this product, Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel with Aloe, that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s very reasonable and comes in a large bottle which lasts for many months!  </li>
            <li>this particular fragrance is not my favorite!</li>
            <li>Smells so very fresh with the cucumber.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have used the rose witch hazel in the past and I loved it, decided to try the cucumber one and the smell is just not for me.</li>
            <li>It has a light cucumber aroma and makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face.</li>
            <li>Or, if you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s just shaved!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- I pour it into a mister for quick and easy</li>
            <li>Very gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the original Thayer&#x27;s with aloe.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted alcohol free!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00137P2QG Thayers Original Witch Hazel with Organic Aloe Vera Formula Astringent Pads 60 ea]].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased that I&#x27;m using this now.  </li>
            <li>It is the same as regular witch hazel, but a bit more refreshing, which makes it more enjoyable to use, and gives me a nice wake-up feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li>it is a great way to freshen up after being outside in the hot humid weather or after a shower!</li>
            <li>Smells really fresh and feels cool to the touch!</li>
            <li>It is not alcohol-based and therefore does not sting when applied, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Did some web research for more natural remedies; this stuff bubbled to the top of my wishlist and after using it for about two months, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>I get a mellow, but refreshing whiff of cucumber and hint of citrus, which helps me reel my soul back into my body in the morning, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, so gourd loving zombies aren&#x27;t tempted to eat my face off when go out for the day.</li>
            <li>Face feels squeaky clean after using</li>
            <li>These Witch Hazel Brands are by far the best thing to use as a Facial Toner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my face clean and refreshed just as well as the toners that I had been using before.  </li>
            <li>The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Our faces feel clean and it doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin.</li>
            <li>The cucumber scent is light and fades quickly so it won&#x27;t clash with your fav aftershave.</li>
            <li>And you get a nice big bottle with a pinhole dispenser top.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination skin and this acts as a nice toner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, but it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent, and I barely notice it now.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the soft scent of these, and it works well in my homemade wipe solution!</li>
            <li>nothing special, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves my skin clean and soft without over-drying.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin from peeling, and also cool and freshens skin.</li>
            <li>I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel refreshed and cool</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the fresh scent and feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the way my skin feels with this.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I put it in my frig to keep it cool and after getting up or a shower use a cotton ball to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent: a hint of cucumber but not too much.</li>
            <li>that might be options worth considering for those who don&#x27;t enjoy this cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>If you really love the smell of cucumber you might like this, it was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>and i just really don&#x27;t have more to say</li>
            <li>I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately.</li>
            <li>The twelve ounce size is a good value as well ringing in at just under ten bucks.</li>
            <li>and I can deal for such good results.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Mildly cleanse and tighten your pores (I experienced a tightening sensation the first week I used this, but this may not be the case for everyone, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to using harsher astringents)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I still have to say that the rose is my favorite, but if my skin is feeling exceptionally dry</li>
            <li>This leaves my face feeling cool -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>, I believe this is great quality vs other brands that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>Nice usual Witch Hazel product and this Alcohol-Free Toner is a kind and goes smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sun-burns and other skin issues too.</li>
            <li>Great service,very good product-almost impossible to find skin care products without alcohol,so I am very pleased with the whole experience.</li>
            <li>Use all toners after a fresh, clean, exfoliated skin.  </li>
            <li>Non-drying and leaves the skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li>Love the smell of fresh cucumber scent and my face has really improved since using this product.</li>
            <li>The mild scent is not one that lingers either</li>
            <li>At first I was not sure if I liked it as well, but after using it for a while, I find it pleasant and soothing...</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>It works fairly well (better than the plain astringent witch hazel).</li>
            <li>Already love witch hazel so aloe and cucumber make this extra great just to even swipe my face in the middle of the day</li>
            <li>Can tell the quality is so much better than what I normally buy in the stores.</li>
            <li>Great for cooling down your skin on a hot day or night!</li>
            <li>My new favorite beauty ritual.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and feels refreshing, but I don&#x27;t think it particularly helped as a facial toner.  </li>
            <li>This helps calm the irritation so the pimples can heal quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the listed ingredients, and the smell is acceptable (like a strong, real cucumber smell +</li>
            <li>This product is also a good value and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li>First of all， Shipping soon  and  it&#x27;s  Very moisturizing lotion,so  i love it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a superior solution that works well to dry up acne and soothe irritation on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and seems to clear my skin of redness!</li>
            <li>i really like this product!!  </li>
            <li>This smells EXACTLY like a cucumber!  </li>
            <li>I thought Witch Hazel only came in full strength, but this brand really feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>Washing my face in the morning left my face too dry even for my oily skin, but this is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I like the Rose one just a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Face feels calm afer using.</li>
            <li>Great for skin without being harsh (has no alcohol) though.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, reduces my pore size, and removes any leftover makeup that&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li>well, fresh cucumbers.  </li>
            <li>I make my own facial toner</li>
            <li>It truly smells like a freshly cut cucumber.</li>
            <li>astringent and toning properties are so good that I&#x27;ll definitely use the bottle of cucumber regardless, because the scent doesn&#x27;t interfere too much.</li>
            <li>That being said, we love how the Witch Hazel cleans and makes our skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The rose scented one is a personal fave as well.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, and definitely not overpowering to leave you smelling like grandpa.</li>
            <li>Def worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most moisturizing, soothing toner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love that every ingredient is derived from natural sources using organic aloe and organic witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I use it after the oil method cleaning at night (it works well as an extra step to remove any make-up or dirt leftover), and also nice as a toner.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and will provide healing properties as well as soothing properties with the addition of cucumber.</li>
            <li>smell just like fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and moisturized throughout most of the day.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fresh and I like the smell of cucumber.</li>
            <li>But I like the fresh scent this product has, over the unscented version.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter (by far), smooth, clean and balanced - no dryness at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and crisp and neither feminine nor masculine; certainly not overbearing like some brands - making it a great option for males or females.</li>
            <li>it really does cool those hot spots on your neck!</li>
            <li>The cucumber doesn&#x27;t smell as good but it doesn&#x27;t give me burning sensations to my face like the other two.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, everything is good considering the price.</li>
            <li>I hope it as good as other products I ordered from you.</li>
            <li>The other good thing about this toner is the price.  </li>
            <li>I use it after cleansing to get my face extra clean!!  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day right after washing my face.</li>
            <li>I use it right after cleansing with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Even better than my usual go-to, the rose flavored one.</li>
            <li>They only thing that I do not like is the smell, very strong.  </li>
            <li>helps your face feel fresh clean and smooth and you noticed a younger look, I even noticed the difference on my moms face</li>
            <li>and it really came in handy during those events, when gentleness is essential.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it since my skin is now completely clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Super gentle but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I find the cucumber scent to come across as clean and natural, not heavy and perfumed as seems to be the case with most alcohol-based aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>It smells much better than plain witch hazel and love that it has aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle toner.  </li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>I love these toners and have used several.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Only problem with this, as i find with most of thayer&#x27;s products is they clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of comments the day after my first use.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is the lemon.</li>
            <li>First time trying the Cucumber toner for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I put some on my face after a workout and it really made everything feel cooler and fresh.</li>
            <li>It sure bests my last chemical toner.</li>
            <li>makes face feel soft and smooth without greasy residue.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Thayer and I like it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>It really smells exactly like fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to freshly shaved skin.  </li>
            <li>On hot days, I use it during the day to stay refreshed.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering this product or any product with witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a bit musty at first.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying the Cucumber.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face and back as that&#x27;s where I break out the most.</li>
            <li>I never used aftershave before, but my face simply feels better after using it.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been consistent with this product.</li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing it.</li>
            <li>you think that you&#x27;re immune to giant, spastic, takes-three-weeks-to-get-rid-of zits, then more power to you, my friend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the feel of smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I had a rush after the first use</li>
            <li>I had a lot of comments the day after my first use.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product or anything made by Thayer.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to try a stronger one (with alcohol)</li>
            <li>The scent is precisely rooted in natural cucumber scent</li>
            <li>The cucumber doesn&#x27;t have that same refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I had smelled it first.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel extra moisturized before I apply lotion.:)</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling baby smooth soft even before I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has a definite cucumber smell and it&#x27;s refreshing when I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Products are so good to use everyday after cleaning the face, even for hands.....</li>
            <li>The flip top cap makes it easy to dispense a little squirt onto a cloth.</li>
            <li>The other reviews on this product have been pretty amusing, I never thought about guys using toner, but this stuff works</li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell to it while at the same time making my skin feel refreshed!  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more when I run out, which won&#x27;t be any time soon because second bonus: the bottle is quite large.</li>
            <li>Smells great but subtle and the scent dissipates when it dries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often surprised at what comes off my face when I think it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li>I had done a ton of research and found that witch hazel, aloe, and cucumber along with being alcohol free were the best thing for those itchy, ugly bumps...</li>
            <li>I feel like I have come out of a high end spa, with fresh slices just taken off of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I usually use the Unscented version, but figured I&#x27;d try the cucumber for something bright and uplifting to smell during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural, nondrying, cool, refrshing &amp; cleansing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells really great (not too much, not too little, and it really smells natural.)</li>
            <li>Package was neat and easy to open.</li>
            <li>The natural scent is relaxing, and it fades quickly so it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and the witch hazel is the same</li>
            <li>I use Aveeno smart essentials night time moisture infusion.</li>
            <li>and I am positive this toner is responsible for that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all and feels so refreshing like your own little spa treatment at home.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product, but it has a faint sweetness to it which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>it is VERY cucumbery.</li>
            <li>I apply to my face and neck after washing (sometimes I shower and spritz it onto my whole body after drying off)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soothing and gentle on our skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying</li>
            <li>Is so gentle i like it so much.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, it soothes and really cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and make my skin feel so clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li>Gentle but gets all the makeup off your skin that washing may have missed.</li>
            <li>I really like this cucumber one.</li>
            <li>This toner really cleans off what did not come off from the cleanser.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>No burn like alcohol-containing products, and the cucumber scent is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent that remains after 20-30 seconds is much lighter and more enjoyable before disappearing a few minute later.</li>
            <li>I notice the difference when I skip out on the toner as it gently exfoliates the skin and removes whatever dirt and oil</li>
            <li>; very soothing.</li>
            <li>But it moisturizes me skin real well.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>This toner really refreshes, cools the skin, and seems to balance the oil production.</li>
            <li>Also very cooling and soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel is very soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very versatile lotion.</li>
            <li>Not drying, very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment also.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to use as a gentle aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li>but it really helps your skin.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, it does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Provides a refreshing lift midday; I use a cotton swab and swipe my face Round 1pm and am rewarded with a calming fresh feeling</li>
            <li>prior to the cucumber, cant decide which one is better as far as smell goes.</li>
            <li>It is a good toner, but I am not thrilled with it either.</li>
            <li>Also, the restorative and healing properties are fantastic, without the alcohol sting that is present in so many other products.</li>
            <li>I have rosecea which makes my skin very sensitive, this Witch Hazel calmed some of the redness after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Thayer Original Witch Hazel, 12 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>Everything is good, but, the smell is really ......... not good</li>
            <li>We use a high end line for our facials and this toner is comparable to another toner we have on backbar that we pay 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li>This, along with occasional spot treatment, has cleared my acne right up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the normal muted cucumber scent you&#x27;d expect from most other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, mild but effective, and affordable - one bottle can last me 2 months of daily facial</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without toner!</li>
            <li>Really does smell like a fresh cut cucumber, a nice unisex scent that doesnt last much past application.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this as an aftershave (I mix witchhazel with sunblock lotion), but the cucumber smell is odd.  </li>
            <li>My face feels more balanced and less d</li>
            <li>In less than a week, my skin looks better than it has in years without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin in some areas, but if I use a even a light moisturizer it makes my face oily with patches that are still cracked and peeling.</li>
            <li>but I will be switching back to rose petal when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>The aesthetician told me the toner I was using was too harsh and recommended a different brand, but also said witch hazel and cucumber are good and soothing and non drying for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I had my kids, I suffer from acne more in my middle age than I ever did as a teen!!</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel products are high quality, but some may find them to be overpriced compared to the generic drug store alternatives, which for most purposes, work equally well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never pay high dollar for Brand Name Toners again.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and have tried high end and drugstore toners.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed.</li>
            <li>Really works well to keep my dry, sensitive skin blemish free.</li>
            <li>It has worked great for my oily skin; I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and less oiliness.</li>
            <li>so it comes out slowly, no wasting of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really disappointing especially after seeing so many good review, I was hoping this product could work on me too.</li>
            <li>I like the cucumber&#x27;s fresh scent, but if the smells bothers you, the scent does not last after application so no worries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny, and makes up for it in not having to buy multiple serums and treatments for each of our needs.</li>
            <li>The smell was not my favor and it just dried up my face even more.</li>
            <li>There are no icky ingredients, either - just as nature intended.</li>
            <li>It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different toners, they either leave my face dry or sticky.</li>
            <li>I use it daily right after I rinse from a shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you order this brand for its soothing witch hazel content and combine with your favorite scent or keep it plain, either way</li>
            <li>you dont smell like a cucumber for long, and the scent is mild anyway.</li>
            <li>Smell is light and no stinging or drying like other products that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft and clear!!</li>
            <li>It smells a little different compared to many cucumber scented products on the market, but that might be because it is made with real cucumber and not a chemical-created scent.</li>
            <li>i believe it helps my whiteheads clear up!  </li>
            <li>Helps with clearing up my acne to a considerable level!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>leaving my skin soft and evening out my tone!</li>
            <li>Also the scent (which smells closer to dead flowers than cucumber) is not too strong, yet lingers longer than you might expect.  </li>
            <li>There was a definite, positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Have been using Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel as a facial toner after oil cleansing method (using LIfe-flo Oil Pure Almond).</li>
            <li>It May Smell a little funny at first</li>
            <li>This is good as a toner post shave or any time, however the scent is a little heavy and may or may not be your cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is great for you but often stinks.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone sensitive skin and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all my acne, it has def unmoved my skin quite a bit</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>Natural toner.</li>
            <li>No alcohol and her skin feel soft helps with keeping her skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I follow it with Nivea Sensitive</li>
            <li>By the way, I have combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying or breaking out my combo and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really does shrink pores if used daily.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin this is the holy grail.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this brand</li>
            <li>not harsh, picks up</li>
            <li>I use this after shaving - it keeps skin clear and soft without leaving a residue or shine.</li>
            <li>So far I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have no idea about it so far.</li>
            <li>I use it after I shave and it helps keeps my shin soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, just during those times when my skins feels sensitive or irritated.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and a lot of toners</li>
            <li>and they are definitely not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try the Cucumber because Cucumber offers a soothing quality to calming skin.</li>
            <li>This is a vital part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>a 30 year old girl who does not use anything but moisturizer,</li>
            <li>I would not go that far.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>So far it does seem to help with my complexion.</li>
            <li>But I was wrong, it just smells like fresh cucumber which is refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>Witch hazel by itself has a very distinct smell, however it goes away once dried.</li>
            <li>it does work despite my reaction to it, my skin was tight and clean and no razor burn afterwards,</li>
            <li>I mean what more can I say.</li>
            <li>It is just OK, not good for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so yes if you use a lot of other skin products this might not make such a huge difference for you, but it did for me.  </li>
            <li>but it last for a long time and worth the money for its quality witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I received this product exactly on the day I expected to.</li>
            <li>Normally I would moisturize afterwards, but if I forget, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really helps with the dark circles under my eyes... soak a cotton ball and lather it up right under your eyes.</li>
            <li>post-shave Gentle enough for twice daily use</li>
            <li>Removes make up and impurities easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li>Thayers isn&#x27;t scented strong enough for other people to really smell you after a few seconds or so.</li>
            <li>the natural cucumber smell was odd at first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to be included in anyone&#x27;s daily facial regiment.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I was still treating my skin like a teenager&#x27;s skin, and 40 year old skin is different.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and came as expected</li>
            <li>So far, I like it especially in summer time.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like stale cucumbers and feet.</li>
            <li>Some are too strong and some simply are not effective.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because due to a recommendation and found that I really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked well for me in combination with CeraVe foaming facial cleanser and Nivea sensitive facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have now gone back to using Dickinson&#x27;s Pore Perfecting Toner, which contains only witch hazel, 14% natural grain alcohol, and witch hazel extract and works</li>
            <li>did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin or break me out.</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin at all and leaves it moisturized and smelling like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>better, not sure specifically what is different other than the blackheads - which are already visably reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed my acne and pores have decrease tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Needed something gentle to wipe down before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>softening yes, however, upon smelling the scent of cucumber is usually quite refreshing, but the smell that lingers after the formula has dried.</li>
            <li>I found this toner which had good reviews and is way less expensive.  </li>
            <li>This product was amazing in that usually after using it I either didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer at all, or just a  very small amount.</li>
            <li>this is the pure.. out of your grocery store green skin smell.</li>
            <li>Damage your skin cells like most astringent brands that contain parabens, SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate and its naughty cousins) or other harsh ingredients</li>
            <li>I highly recommend not only the aloe but the other infused witch hazel by Thayer!</li>
            <li>I will update if anything changes, good or bad.</li>

            <li> Very nice aroma, my husband likes it after he shaves.</li>

            <li> I used this brand before, in rose petal &amp; lavender and cucumber is also very good.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not drying at all and the cucumber smell is quite pleasant.</li>

            <li> Great product great company...to many words</li>
            <li> It keeps my face bright and toned and keeps the oil in check.</li>

            <li> This stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I soak it with compressed masks, it works good.</li>
            <li> Great toner for your skin and also an awesome salad dressing spritzer on a hot summer day.  </li>
            <li> While I like both products, I think I liked the Original Witch Hazel with Aloe the best.</li>
            <li> How wonderful this is if you experience hot flashes!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Smells and feels great, I no longer have to purchase from so called &amp;#34;kitchen cosmetic&amp;#34; businesses for this stuff which charge way more.</li>
            <li> I reeeally wanted to love this cucumber toner; it smells great</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this!  </li>
            <li> I love this face tonic !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and as it is really refreshing!</li>
            <li> Great product - I originally purchased the Rose Witch Hazel which I really loved.</li>
            <li> Thayers brand of witch hazel is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell like cucumber, but it&#x27;s not as bright and refreshing as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Found this from heyfranhey and her amazing youtube channel.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing, its so calming and my skin is prone to redness.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it&#x27;s alcohol free (the one that I ordered was, anyway)</li>
            <li> I like cucumber over the rose and lavender.  </li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS AND THE ROSE WATER, I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER, BUT BOTH ARE REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li> For some reason the rose leaves my skin tighter and brighter looking.</li>
            <li> some kind of medicine/sterile bandage type of smell combined).</li>
            <li> Feels so nice after using.</li>
            <li> great product great scent for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have used the rose, lavender and cucumber one to date</li>
            <li> The cucumber aloe soothes so nicely</li>
            <li> but I found it doesn&#x27;t work as well for my skin as the rose one.</li>
            <li> Has a nice cucumber scent, but my skin just doesn&#x27;t look as nice with this.</li>
            <li> Will use it up and order the rose one.</li>
            <li> I also like the rose flavor - use that one in winter and the cucumber in summer.</li>
            <li> Nice toner that doesn&#x27;t sting when you apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this and the rose scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Rose and the Lavender months ago.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I use the Rose one as well as the Lavender</li>
            <li> I gave this to a bunch of my friends for a Favorite Things themed Christmas party and EVERYONE loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice feel on the face after a shave, though can sometimes leave a sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Nice to keep in frig to close poors after cleansing.</li>
            <li> M Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz]]</li>
            <li> Now I would rate the rose one 5 stars because the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering the rose one instead.</li>
            <li> It does feel nice though.</li>
            <li> i like it, it nice to try.</li>
            <li> is nice.</li>
            <li> tried the rose petal?</li>
            <li> The cucumber smell is noticeable and I liked that.</li>
            <li> so this is a nice way to freshen up.</li>
            <li> so I bought clay and mix this with the clay and make my own mask</li>
            <li> I own a salon and have this on my backbar.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of a cream moisturizer after washing my face and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> and it feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with the rose.</li>
            <li> I prefer the rose.</li>
            <li> I tried also the rose one before, but I really like the cucumber the best!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and smells cucumbery fresh!</li>
            <li> This particular product, which includes cucumbers, works excellent.</li>
            <li> I usually love the Rose Petal, but find this is better for skin redness!</li>
            <li> All natural, great cucumber smell, no residue, feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li> Great seller and quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> The toner has a wonderful cooling sensation, as a cucumber toner should, and it has all natural ingredients without alcohol and paraben!  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the rose petal</li>
            <li> This one and the Rose one are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice, refreshing</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cucumber and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best toner I have used so far~</li>
            <li> gladly order this again, it&#x27;s a nice product&lt;</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> but like the rose better.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft and awesome after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel, so I thought I&#x27;d try out the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves my skin soo smooth!</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice scent - clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love  love love this product!</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s because women have used more skin products all their life, so they are used to having nice skin; and we guys, for the most part do not, so we&#x27;re amazed at the change when we use this stuff?</li>
            <li> Gives good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> although, I love the scent of roses, I find the Rose Thayer&#x27;s to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and amazing!  </li>
            <li> Great to put on my face first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent is very light, not over powering.</li>
            <li> The product is alcohol free which is important in order to avoid a stinging effect and the cucumber scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and awesome product!</li>
            <li> Packaging was great -- it arrived in good shape and the product looked new and clean.</li>
            <li> Thayer has excellent toner - I especially love the Cucumber Witch Hazel as it is gentle on sensitive skin and very cooling.</li>
            <li> have HUGE boil-like zits all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better and the bags under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> However I love these toners and was put, so I decided to keep the bottle.</li>
            <li> Non drying and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  </li>
            <li> So nice to find something that&#x27;s natural and a great value to boot.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have tried a dozen or more toners designed for peps like me, but they almost always have alcohol.</li>
            <li> She love it.  </li>
            <li> I love to use these as toners in the summer.  </li>
            <li> They are cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love it:</li>
            <li> Pick this up in the summer, it might just be better than aloe.</li>
            <li> It  soothes and calms my skin and on top of that it&#x27;s not packed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Thayer Witch Hazel products as an aftershave for many years.</li>
            <li> (otherwise it would look funny to have  nice looking skin on my throat and cheeks, but nowhere else!).  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This feels great but is not as much of an astringent as I am used to.  </li>
            <li> I had read that undistilled witch hazel has more anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, there is more aloe vera than there is witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product  - recommended by HeyFranHey.com.  </li>
            <li> I love the cucumber scent.  </li>

            <li> I love all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel astringent.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the performance of Thayers witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Better than the lavender one</li>
            <li> this is my first foray into toner and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I just started to use it for a week or so, it&#x27;s not as &#x27;magical&#x27; as I thought ir would be.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and not flirting to the skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite .</li>
            <li> I use Konjac sponges to exfoliate and I notice that my toner does much better having exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> It feels refreshing</li>
            <li> Love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> so I am glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner at very inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> not a fan of its scent, and I did&#x27;t see its effect on acne as many reviews here mentioned.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is gentle and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Can reapply many times throughout the day to refresh.</li>
            <li> I love all the Thayer witch hazels.</li>
            <li> Love Witch Hazel and</li>
            <li> out there are too drying, which makes my skin over produce oil causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I like the refreshing feeling it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> Which happen to be my favorite fruit, so I don&#x27;t mind applying it.  </li>
            <li> And it is alcohol free, nice for my skin，the smell</li>
            <li> I love using this product after my morning shave to rinse my face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After reading the many and varied uses for witch hazel (some of which include: heat rash, poison ivy, boils, insect bites, and as an astringent to shrink pores)</li>
            <li> My face dislikes being washed more than once a day</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> My skin texture is way more even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the wonders of this stuff and am glad to have it as part of my postpartum care collection.</li>
            <li> Love that the witch hazel is potent in this...</li>
            <li> you will probably find this mixture overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that it will work OK as a toner, but I don&#x27;t like the aroma, what there is of it.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect facial toner.  </li>
            <li> and I love the look of it.</li>
            <li> Clients love the cucumber scent</li>
            <li> If you love cucumber you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love Thayers products but</li>
            <li> It gives me a refreshing feeling and does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it.</li>
            <li> I love The Body Shop Tea a Tree toner, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought the cucumber scent would be refreshing.</li>
            <li> Before I bought, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the cucumber smell while I was imagining something chemical smell of cucumber.  </li>
            <li> The smell was not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent,</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure what I&#x27;m supposed to use this for.  </li>
            <li> Love all of Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toners, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The cucumber is refreshing, calming and would work well for men, as well as women (me.) :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> The best facial toner ever!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Fresh, clean feeling and great scent</li>
            <li> Feels very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I originally tried Thayer&#x27;s rose scented toner because it was the cheapest.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no guarantee they&#x27;d have this scent over, say, the original kind.</li>
            <li> Love all Thayer toners, and this one is super refreshing!</li>
            <li> This product has a cool, refreshing feel, and a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps.</li>
            <li> I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love the product!</li>
            <li> Anyway, it smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Although I loved the Rose Petal, this by far beats it!</li>
            <li> The cucumber is fine: I know many people consider it their favorite.</li>
            <li> Cheap, natural, and effective - this is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people who live in areas where the weather changes drastically between seasons.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality product, fast delivery, free delivery</li>
            <li> and it feels like water on my face, great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love all the Thayer witch hazels but this one is especially nice due to soothing cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li> It is very sweet and cucumber smelly</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a toner for nearly two months now, and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent is refreshing, but light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> What I expected, an excellent product</li>
            <li> Great natural astringent.</li>
            <li> The alcohol free formula is also refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li> Great with my rosacea and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I think this is a really good product it cleans up make up really well and hasn&#x27;t messed up my skin.</li>
            <li> I WAS RIGHT!!</li>
            <li> I needed to quickly get some more witch hazel, as I love its use as an astringent.</li>
            <li> In fact, we&#x27;re out now and my first order was cancelled, so I&#x27;m trying to find the fastest way to get more!  </li>
            <li> Also love how it smells of fresh cucumbers!</li>
            <li> My face feels so cool and refreshed after using this!</li>
            <li> Works okay, not as well as the original witch hazel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthier looking, more supple, the pores are clean.  </li>
            <li> Love the rose... but unless you REALLY and</li>
            <li> Was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li> the shipping was very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> It is very mild, and nourishing.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to control usage.  </li>
            <li> This product has a strong, acidic cucumber scent that some people may find off-putting.</li>
            <li> The cucumber smell is strong but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> A refreshing astringent that makes your face feel cool and renewed.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on high quality, natural and organic toners and this IS the best!!!  </li>
            <li> A fine product for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this witch hazel and has noticeable differences in fine lines and his pores are almost invisible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Smells great and is very gentle to older skin.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the Rose Witch Hazel, but I think the Cucumber one is better on my skin as I tend to have sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no question to it - when you add cucumber into the mix you&#x27;re left with a great product.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Lightly re-moisturize the skin</li>
            <li> I like this toner, but not as much as the rose scent.</li>
            <li> It heals and gives my skin a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> Great product for the low price!</li>
            <li> This toner is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> It serves as a fantastic toner and I use it after washing my face, not even needing a moisturizer because it works so well</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the smell but the toner itself is absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s is a go-to product for me and this scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> And smells so light.</li>
            <li> I use Acne Free Terminator 10 on problem areas.</li>
            <li> I does feel fantastic on your skin after a shower - makes my face feel moisturized without any oil or lotions.</li>
            <li> This product is great after I come back from hiking</li>
            <li> Love the fresh cucumber smell.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has no artificial fragrance, and that it cleanses and soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> Really reasonably priced for the size of bottle and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toner.  </li>
            <li> Great product I definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as an alternative to my cheap T.N.Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel which I use as an aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li> This makes a great facial toner!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> I also used this in a home made baby wipe solution (along with Diaper Lotion Potion concentrate), and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> The size was bigger than I was expecting which is great.</li>
            <li> It always feels refreshing and it locks natural moisture into your skin effectively.</li>
            <li> I regularly use (and love) Thayer Lavender Witch Hazel, but the reviews were so good about this product, Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel with Aloe, that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s very reasonable and comes in a large bottle which lasts for many months!  </li>
            <li> this particular fragrance is not my favorite!</li>
            <li> Smells so very fresh with the cucumber.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have used the rose witch hazel in the past and I loved it, decided to try the cucumber one and the smell is just not for me.</li>
            <li> It has a light cucumber aroma and makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face.</li>
            <li> Or, if you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s just shaved!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- I pour it into a mister for quick and easy</li>
            <li> Very gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the original Thayer&#x27;s with aloe.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted alcohol free!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00137P2QG Thayers Original Witch Hazel with Organic Aloe Vera Formula Astringent Pads 60 ea]].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased that I&#x27;m using this now.  </li>
            <li> It is the same as regular witch hazel, but a bit more refreshing, which makes it more enjoyable to use, and gives me a nice wake-up feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li> it is a great way to freshen up after being outside in the hot humid weather or after a shower!</li>
            <li> Smells really fresh and feels cool to the touch!</li>
            <li> It is not alcohol-based and therefore does not sting when applied, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Did some web research for more natural remedies; this stuff bubbled to the top of my wishlist and after using it for about two months, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> I get a mellow, but refreshing whiff of cucumber and hint of citrus, which helps me reel my soul back into my body in the morning, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, so gourd loving zombies aren&#x27;t tempted to eat my face off when go out for the day.</li>
            <li> Face feels squeaky clean after using</li>
            <li> These Witch Hazel Brands are by far the best thing to use as a Facial Toner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my face clean and refreshed just as well as the toners that I had been using before.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Our faces feel clean and it doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent is light and fades quickly so it won&#x27;t clash with your fav aftershave.</li>
            <li> And you get a nice big bottle with a pinhole dispenser top.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin and this acts as a nice toner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, but it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent, and I barely notice it now.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the soft scent of these, and it works well in my homemade wipe solution!</li>
            <li> nothing special, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and leaves my skin clean and soft without over-drying.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin from peeling, and also cool and freshens skin.</li>
            <li> I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel refreshed and cool</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the fresh scent and feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the way my skin feels with this.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I put it in my frig to keep it cool and after getting up or a shower use a cotton ball to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> I also love the scent: a hint of cucumber but not too much.</li>
            <li> that might be options worth considering for those who don&#x27;t enjoy this cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> If you really love the smell of cucumber you might like this, it was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> and i just really don&#x27;t have more to say</li>
            <li> I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately.</li>
            <li> The twelve ounce size is a good value as well ringing in at just under ten bucks.</li>
            <li> and I can deal for such good results.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Mildly cleanse and tighten your pores (I experienced a tightening sensation the first week I used this, but this may not be the case for everyone, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to using harsher astringents)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I still have to say that the rose is my favorite, but if my skin is feeling exceptionally dry</li>
            <li> This leaves my face feeling cool -- clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> , I believe this is great quality vs other brands that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Nice usual Witch Hazel product and this Alcohol-Free Toner is a kind and goes smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sun-burns and other skin issues too.</li>
            <li> Great service,very good product-almost impossible to find skin care products without alcohol,so I am very pleased with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> Use all toners after a fresh, clean, exfoliated skin.  </li>
            <li> Non-drying and leaves the skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li> Love the smell of fresh cucumber scent and my face has really improved since using this product.</li>
            <li> The mild scent is not one that lingers either</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if I liked it as well, but after using it for a while, I find it pleasant and soothing...</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> It works fairly well (better than the plain astringent witch hazel).</li>
            <li> Already love witch hazel so aloe and cucumber make this extra great just to even swipe my face in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> Can tell the quality is so much better than what I normally buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> Great for cooling down your skin on a hot day or night!</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty ritual.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and feels refreshing, but I don&#x27;t think it particularly helped as a facial toner.  </li>
            <li> This helps calm the irritation so the pimples can heal quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the listed ingredients, and the smell is acceptable (like a strong, real cucumber smell +</li>
            <li> This product is also a good value and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> First of all， Shipping soon  and  it&#x27;s  Very moisturizing lotion,so  i love it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a superior solution that works well to dry up acne and soothe irritation on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and seems to clear my skin of redness!</li>
            <li> i really like this product!!  </li>
            <li> This smells EXACTLY like a cucumber!  </li>
            <li> I thought Witch Hazel only came in full strength, but this brand really feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> Washing my face in the morning left my face too dry even for my oily skin, but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I like the Rose one just a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Face feels calm afer using.</li>
            <li> Great for skin without being harsh (has no alcohol) though.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh, reduces my pore size, and removes any leftover makeup that&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> well, fresh cucumbers.  </li>
            <li> I make my own facial toner</li>
            <li> It truly smells like a freshly cut cucumber.</li>
            <li> astringent and toning properties are so good that I&#x27;ll definitely use the bottle of cucumber regardless, because the scent doesn&#x27;t interfere too much.</li>
            <li> That being said, we love how the Witch Hazel cleans and makes our skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> The rose scented one is a personal fave as well.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, and definitely not overpowering to leave you smelling like grandpa.</li>
            <li> Def worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most moisturizing, soothing toner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love that every ingredient is derived from natural sources using organic aloe and organic witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I use it after the oil method cleaning at night (it works well as an extra step to remove any make-up or dirt leftover), and also nice as a toner.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and will provide healing properties as well as soothing properties with the addition of cucumber.</li>
            <li> smell just like fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li> My face is soft and moisturized throughout most of the day.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fresh and I like the smell of cucumber.</li>
            <li> But I like the fresh scent this product has, over the unscented version.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter (by far), smooth, clean and balanced - no dryness at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and crisp and neither feminine nor masculine; certainly not overbearing like some brands - making it a great option for males or females.</li>
            <li> it really does cool those hot spots on your neck!</li>
            <li> The cucumber doesn&#x27;t smell as good but it doesn&#x27;t give me burning sensations to my face like the other two.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, everything is good considering the price.</li>
            <li> I hope it as good as other products I ordered from you.</li>
            <li> The other good thing about this toner is the price.  </li>
            <li> I use it after cleansing to get my face extra clean!!  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day right after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I use it right after cleansing with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Even better than my usual go-to, the rose flavored one.</li>
            <li> They only thing that I do not like is the smell, very strong.  </li>
            <li> helps your face feel fresh clean and smooth and you noticed a younger look, I even noticed the difference on my moms face</li>
            <li> and it really came in handy during those events, when gentleness is essential.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it since my skin is now completely clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Super gentle but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I find the cucumber scent to come across as clean and natural, not heavy and perfumed as seems to be the case with most alcohol-based aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> It smells much better than plain witch hazel and love that it has aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle toner.  </li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> I love these toners and have used several.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Only problem with this, as i find with most of thayer&#x27;s products is they clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of comments the day after my first use.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite is the lemon.</li>
            <li> First time trying the Cucumber toner for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I put some on my face after a workout and it really made everything feel cooler and fresh.</li>
            <li> It sure bests my last chemical toner.</li>
            <li> makes face feel soft and smooth without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Thayer and I like it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> It really smells exactly like fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing to freshly shaved skin.  </li>
            <li> On hot days, I use it during the day to stay refreshed.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this product or any product with witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a bit musty at first.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the Cucumber.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and back as that&#x27;s where I break out the most.</li>
            <li> I never used aftershave before, but my face simply feels better after using it.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been consistent with this product.</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing it.</li>
            <li> you think that you&#x27;re immune to giant, spastic, takes-three-weeks-to-get-rid-of zits, then more power to you, my friend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the feel of smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I had a rush after the first use</li>
            <li> I had a lot of comments the day after my first use.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product or anything made by Thayer.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to try a stronger one (with alcohol)</li>
            <li> The scent is precisely rooted in natural cucumber scent</li>
            <li> The cucumber doesn&#x27;t have that same refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I had smelled it first.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel extra moisturized before I apply lotion.:)</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling baby smooth soft even before I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has a definite cucumber smell and it&#x27;s refreshing when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Products are so good to use everyday after cleaning the face, even for hands.....</li>
            <li> The flip top cap makes it easy to dispense a little squirt onto a cloth.</li>
            <li> The other reviews on this product have been pretty amusing, I never thought about guys using toner, but this stuff works</li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell to it while at the same time making my skin feel refreshed!  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more when I run out, which won&#x27;t be any time soon because second bonus: the bottle is quite large.</li>
            <li> Smells great but subtle and the scent dissipates when it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often surprised at what comes off my face when I think it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> I had done a ton of research and found that witch hazel, aloe, and cucumber along with being alcohol free were the best thing for those itchy, ugly bumps...</li>
            <li> I feel like I have come out of a high end spa, with fresh slices just taken off of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Unscented version, but figured I&#x27;d try the cucumber for something bright and uplifting to smell during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural, nondrying, cool, refrshing &amp; cleansing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells really great (not too much, not too little, and it really smells natural.)</li>
            <li> Package was neat and easy to open.</li>
            <li> The natural scent is relaxing, and it fades quickly so it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and the witch hazel is the same</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno smart essentials night time moisture infusion.</li>
            <li> and I am positive this toner is responsible for that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all and feels so refreshing like your own little spa treatment at home.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, but it has a faint sweetness to it which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> it is VERY cucumbery.</li>
            <li> I apply to my face and neck after washing (sometimes I shower and spritz it onto my whole body after drying off)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soothing and gentle on our skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying</li>
            <li> Is so gentle i like it so much.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, it soothes and really cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and make my skin feel so clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li> Gentle but gets all the makeup off your skin that washing may have missed.</li>
            <li> I really like this cucumber one.</li>
            <li> This toner really cleans off what did not come off from the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> No burn like alcohol-containing products, and the cucumber scent is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent that remains after 20-30 seconds is much lighter and more enjoyable before disappearing a few minute later.</li>
            <li> I notice the difference when I skip out on the toner as it gently exfoliates the skin and removes whatever dirt and oil</li>
            <li> ; very soothing.</li>
            <li> But it moisturizes me skin real well.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> This toner really refreshes, cools the skin, and seems to balance the oil production.</li>
            <li> Also very cooling and soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel is very soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile lotion.</li>
            <li> Not drying, very soothing.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment also.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use as a gentle aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li> but it really helps your skin.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh, it does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Provides a refreshing lift midday; I use a cotton swab and swipe my face Round 1pm and am rewarded with a calming fresh feeling</li>
            <li> prior to the cucumber, cant decide which one is better as far as smell goes.</li>
            <li> It is a good toner, but I am not thrilled with it either.</li>
            <li> Also, the restorative and healing properties are fantastic, without the alcohol sting that is present in so many other products.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea which makes my skin very sensitive, this Witch Hazel calmed some of the redness after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Thayer Original Witch Hazel, 12 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Everything is good, but, the smell is really ......... not good</li>
            <li> We use a high end line for our facials and this toner is comparable to another toner we have on backbar that we pay 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li> This, along with occasional spot treatment, has cleared my acne right up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the normal muted cucumber scent you&#x27;d expect from most other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, mild but effective, and affordable - one bottle can last me 2 months of daily facial</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without toner!</li>
            <li> Really does smell like a fresh cut cucumber, a nice unisex scent that doesnt last much past application.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this as an aftershave (I mix witchhazel with sunblock lotion), but the cucumber smell is odd.  </li>
            <li> My face feels more balanced and less d</li>
            <li> In less than a week, my skin looks better than it has in years without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in some areas, but if I use a even a light moisturizer it makes my face oily with patches that are still cracked and peeling.</li>
            <li> but I will be switching back to rose petal when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> The aesthetician told me the toner I was using was too harsh and recommended a different brand, but also said witch hazel and cucumber are good and soothing and non drying for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I had my kids, I suffer from acne more in my middle age than I ever did as a teen!!</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel products are high quality, but some may find them to be overpriced compared to the generic drug store alternatives, which for most purposes, work equally well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never pay high dollar for Brand Name Toners again.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have tried high end and drugstore toners.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed.</li>
            <li> Really works well to keep my dry, sensitive skin blemish free.</li>
            <li> It has worked great for my oily skin; I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and less oiliness.</li>
            <li> so it comes out slowly, no wasting of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing especially after seeing so many good review, I was hoping this product could work on me too.</li>
            <li> I like the cucumber&#x27;s fresh scent, but if the smells bothers you, the scent does not last after application so no worries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny, and makes up for it in not having to buy multiple serums and treatments for each of our needs.</li>
            <li> The smell was not my favor and it just dried up my face even more.</li>
            <li> There are no icky ingredients, either - just as nature intended.</li>
            <li> It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different toners, they either leave my face dry or sticky.</li>
            <li> I use it daily right after I rinse from a shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you order this brand for its soothing witch hazel content and combine with your favorite scent or keep it plain, either way</li>
            <li> you dont smell like a cucumber for long, and the scent is mild anyway.</li>
            <li> Smell is light and no stinging or drying like other products that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and clear!!</li>
            <li> It smells a little different compared to many cucumber scented products on the market, but that might be because it is made with real cucumber and not a chemical-created scent.</li>
            <li> i believe it helps my whiteheads clear up!  </li>
            <li> Helps with clearing up my acne to a considerable level!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> leaving my skin soft and evening out my tone!</li>
            <li> Also the scent (which smells closer to dead flowers than cucumber) is not too strong, yet lingers longer than you might expect.  </li>
            <li> There was a definite, positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Have been using Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel as a facial toner after oil cleansing method (using LIfe-flo Oil Pure Almond).</li>
            <li> It May Smell a little funny at first</li>
            <li> This is good as a toner post shave or any time, however the scent is a little heavy and may or may not be your cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is great for you but often stinks.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all my acne, it has def unmoved my skin quite a bit</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> Natural toner.</li>
            <li> No alcohol and her skin feel soft helps with keeping her skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I follow it with Nivea Sensitive</li>
            <li> By the way, I have combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying or breaking out my combo and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Really does shrink pores if used daily.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin this is the holy grail.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this brand</li>
            <li> not harsh, picks up</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving - it keeps skin clear and soft without leaving a residue or shine.</li>
            <li> So far I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about it so far.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shave and it helps keeps my shin soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, just during those times when my skins feels sensitive or irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and a lot of toners</li>
            <li> and they are definitely not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the Cucumber because Cucumber offers a soothing quality to calming skin.</li>
            <li> This is a vital part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> a 30 year old girl who does not use anything but moisturizer,</li>
            <li> I would not go that far.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> So far it does seem to help with my complexion.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong, it just smells like fresh cucumber which is refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> Witch hazel by itself has a very distinct smell, however it goes away once dried.</li>
            <li> it does work despite my reaction to it, my skin was tight and clean and no razor burn afterwards,</li>
            <li> I mean what more can I say.</li>
            <li> It is just OK, not good for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so yes if you use a lot of other skin products this might not make such a huge difference for you, but it did for me.  </li>
            <li> but it last for a long time and worth the money for its quality witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I received this product exactly on the day I expected to.</li>
            <li> Normally I would moisturize afterwards, but if I forget, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really helps with the dark circles under my eyes... soak a cotton ball and lather it up right under your eyes.</li>
            <li> post-shave Gentle enough for twice daily use</li>
            <li> Removes make up and impurities easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Thayers isn&#x27;t scented strong enough for other people to really smell you after a few seconds or so.</li>
            <li> the natural cucumber smell was odd at first</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to be included in anyone&#x27;s daily facial regiment.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I was still treating my skin like a teenager&#x27;s skin, and 40 year old skin is different.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and came as expected</li>
            <li> So far, I like it especially in summer time.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like stale cucumbers and feet.</li>
            <li> Some are too strong and some simply are not effective.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because due to a recommendation and found that I really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked well for me in combination with CeraVe foaming facial cleanser and Nivea sensitive facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have now gone back to using Dickinson&#x27;s Pore Perfecting Toner, which contains only witch hazel, 14% natural grain alcohol, and witch hazel extract and works</li>
            <li> did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin or break me out.</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin at all and leaves it moisturized and smelling like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> better, not sure specifically what is different other than the blackheads - which are already visably reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed my acne and pores have decrease tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Needed something gentle to wipe down before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> softening yes, however, upon smelling the scent of cucumber is usually quite refreshing, but the smell that lingers after the formula has dried.</li>
            <li> I found this toner which had good reviews and is way less expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product was amazing in that usually after using it I either didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer at all, or just a  very small amount.</li>
            <li> this is the pure.. out of your grocery store green skin smell.</li>
            <li> Damage your skin cells like most astringent brands that contain parabens, SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate and its naughty cousins) or other harsh ingredients</li>
            <li> I highly recommend not only the aloe but the other infused witch hazel by Thayer!</li>
            <li> I will update if anything changes, good or bad.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product over other toners, especially for sensitive or combination skin.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find locally and the price is usually the same or better on amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you have large facia pores, you have to use this and will notice a difference in less than 7 days!!</li>
            <li> Not sure of its the scent quality, or maybe I don&#x27;t like cucumbers as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> It helps combat the minor acne that I have and contributes to the overall balance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Havent been using it long enough to determine if it will reduce my acne or not</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the cucumber scent is so unbelievably strong that it smells fake.</li>
            <li> This caused a mild burning, irritating sensation on my skin that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have artificial chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t as clear as it is now until I started using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this stuff as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as amazon is selling it.</li>
            <li> Second, the product left a slightly sticky film on my skin which caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend this over plain witch hazel for those with sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to redness.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive to cleansing products, which usually make my skin peel or crack.</li>
            <li> Afterall, I don&#x27;t have breakouts, and I only get an occasional little zit like twice a year from hormonal stuff.</li>
            <li> Other toners make my skin red and this doesn&#x27;t so this one is the one to keep.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> What it won&#x27;t do:&lt;br /&gt;- Dry your skin like alcohol&lt;</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my (combination/oily) skin.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I moisturize with either St Ives Timeless skin, or if I feel dry</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel refreshed and does not leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to be dry, but this lotion hydrates.</li>
            <li> and it never leaves my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> My oiliness on my face has toned down, my pores are smaller, and my acne is improving a lot.</li>
            <li> and I actually have less acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally very dry at this time of year</li>
            <li> It also works well on bug bites or other minor skin</li>
            <li> , I was having some scalp issues (buildup, itching) and I poured this on my scalp and left it for a little bit and then washed it out.  </li>
            <li> I actually keep a little spray bottle with me and spray it over my makeup or bareface throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Regular witch hazel seemed too harsh and would actually cause me to break out a little.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a wet shaver, I recommend using this even on your off days.</li>
            <li> We go through lavender in 1/4th the time it takes me to empty one of these.</li>
            <li> A few times a year I treat myself to a facial.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not something I&#x27;d call &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and they&#x27;ve never done that to me.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just not potent enough.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent is more petroleum based than vegetable based, so I was disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residu like some other products.</li>
            <li> Its lighter that all other toners and my skin dont fell stripped.</li>
            <li> When I went to open it, the hermetically sealed foil part had a small pin hole.</li>
            <li> I might try other Thayer products.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect lasts longer than I expected!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just not potent enough.</li>
            <li> I may try it as a toner when my other one runs out.</li>
            <li> you;ve left behind or just simply refreshes your skin.  </li>
            <li> but it does seem less red than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite difficult to smell the cucumber at all.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, too scented.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day, definitely after every shave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my random pimples though.</li>
            <li> but also I have way less razor burn and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> My pores are less visible.</li>
            <li> And although other reviewers are complaining about the smell, it certainly not strong.  </li>
            <li> The strength seems on par with other witch hazel brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> No alcohol, no strong or odd scent.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier for me to extract a few pores after I work a little on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked when I opened this bottle, because it smells like fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Removes all traces of make up left behind by cleanser and leaves skin balanced.</li>
            <li> I prefer this version, but if it&#x27;s not available</li>
            <li> However, this irritates my face a little bit (slight burning) and I&#x27;m not sure it clears away impurities the way</li>
            <li> But with my insane skin problems: acne, eczema, scarring, premature lines, I thought maybe this Cucumber &amp; Aloe would be better to keep my oily skin down..</li>
            <li> I like that the scent isn&#x27;t too flowery or excessive.</li>
            <li> I usually put i on damp skin, it seems to go on easier.  </li>
            <li> It smells faintly of cucumber but after a minute it&#x27;s totally odorless.</li>
            <li> Tocophery Acetate is in so many things and it can cause horrible damage to the skin and to the person’s self image.</li>
            <li> have used Thayer&#x27;s lavander witch hazel in the past</li>
            <li> in the past</li>
            <li> used this in the past without issue, but this time it seems to excessively burn and redden my skin, also smells like a salad...</li>
            <li> After I received this and tried it out, I realized that I have been pouring money down the drain purchasing way too expensive toners from other companies.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and had been having a lot of flare ups on my face lately and tried everything.</li>
            <li> I used to get painful pimples that took forever to heal but after incorporating this step, my face has been clear of all pimples.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to help my skin but at least for now it is a welcomed addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> But just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean REALLLLY like cucumber</li>
            <li> but prices not really good deal.</li>
            <li> The bottle cap came cracked, if I open the seal the solution could spill, its very inconvenient....</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the cap was broken.</li>
            <li> Sit on your skin like a thin film, or take forever to absorb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on all exposed skin above the base of my neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off giving this crap as a stocking stuffer to your worst mortal enemy.</li>
            <li> The product smells weird, perhaps it&#x27;s the cucumber.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin that is extremely difficult to keep  under control.</li>
            <li> Why buy something expensive?</li>
            <li> addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> The shop shipped me a wrong product, but I decided to try it anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> The type of zits that grow fangs and hiss at the sunlight, and I need an effing priest to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> than buy some expensive one at the mall</li>
            <li> but this doesnt mean its a bad product.</li>
            <li> which they are difficult to rid my face of!  </li>
            <li> I gave it away; it&#x27;s not that it was bad,</li>
            <li> its so bad you don&#x27;t want to put it on your face for fear</li>
            <li> it smells like someone licked your face with a mouthfull of bad breath.</li>
            <li> He hates it &amp; won&#x27;t use the product because he says it smells bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells bad</li>
            <li> I had horrible, painful cysts on my chin for MONTHS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get those horrible, painful breakouts on my chin anymore.</li>
            <li> It also helped alot when I had a bad sunburn on my face!</li>
            <li> I always hated toners.</li>
            <li> used it once and hated it.</li>
            <li> It is so awful that it almost made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> Well I was very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Finally found an affordable toner that my skin loves!</li>
            <li> Ever since I was introduced to this product by a friend, it&#x27;s been my go-to toner. It is not alcohol-based and therefore does not sting when applied, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> I received this product exactly on the day I expected to. It works as described. Would buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have tried several different aftershave products and not only is my face noticeably smoother but also I have way less razor burn and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> It works really well! My skin looks better and the bags under my eyes are gone. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It has a light cucumber aroma and makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a quality product. I like that it is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it daily right after I rinse from a shave. Smells great but subtle and the scent dissipates when it dries. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed. If you&#x27;re a wet shaver, I recommend using this even on your off days. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have acne prone sensitive skin and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all my acne, it has def unmoved my skin quite a bit</li>
            <li> I love these toners and have used several. My favorite is the rose petal and so when I opened the cucumber I almost returned it- it is VERY cucumbery. I like cucumbers, but woah. However I love these toners and was put, so I decided to keep the bottle. The smell is growing on me but I will be switching back to rose petal when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel just feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no question to it - when you add cucumber into the mix you&#x27;re left with a great product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff!  Only been using it for a few days, but I really like the smell and it feels good.  I&#x27;m always trying to stay one step ahead of my skin, and this seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Works great!</li>
            <li> I love all the Thayer witch hazels but this one is especially nice due to soothing cucumber scent.  Non drying and refreshing.  Removes all traces of make up left behind by cleanser and leaves skin balanced.</li>
            <li> This brand is the best witch hazel I&#x27;ve used! I highly recommend not only the aloe but the other infused witch hazel by Thayer!</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> This is good as a toner post shave or any time, however the scent is a little heavy and may or may not be your cup of tea. I like it and use it in equal rotation with lavender, however it is not as well received by the rest of the house so I&#x27;m the only one using this scent. We go through lavender in 1/4th the time it takes me to empty one of these.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and seems to clear my skin of redness!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this as an aftershave (I mix witchhazel with sunblock lotion), but the cucumber smell is odd.  I&#x27;d recommend choosing a different sent.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love the product!</li>
            <li> love it!  My skin is normally very dry at this time of year so I bought this to try and balance things out...wow.  My skin is brighter (by far), smooth, clean and balanced - no dryness at all.  The scent is refreshing and fresh.  I absolutely love this toner.  Do not hesitate if considering it.  The price is wonderful too.  So nice to find something that&#x27;s natural and a great value to boot.  This will be a staple in my bathroom routine for now on!</li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell to it while at the same time making my skin feel refreshed!  I love witch hazel and all of its uses!</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells great (not flowery), doesn&#x27;t haunt you all day Soothing for acne and post-shave Gentle enough for twice daily use Inexpensive  I have acne prone skin and have tried a dozen or more toners designed for peps like me, but they almost always have alcohol. Did some web research for more natural remedies; this stuff bubbled to the top of my wishlist and after using it for about two months, I&#x27;m hooked.  It smells great without being overly floral and feminine like the lavender version. I get a mellow, but refreshing whiff of cucumber and hint of citrus, which helps me reel my soul back into my body in the morning, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, so gourd loving zombies aren&#x27;t tempted to eat my face off when go out for the day. It leaves my skin feeling supple and soothed, not stripped like an alcohol toner. Normally I would moisturize afterwards, but if I forget, it&#x27;s no big deal. My skin doesn&#x27;t over-react and go into oil-overdrive. My face feels more balanced and less d*** finicky since I started using this, so I&#x27;m keeping the Cucumber Witch Hazel in my permanent collection.</li>
            <li> This product has a cool, refreshing feel, and a nice fragrance. It works quite well as an aftershave treatment. Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel products are high quality, but some may find them to be overpriced compared to the generic drug store alternatives, which for most purposes, work equally well.</li>
            <li> Natural toner. Perfect for me...</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night after I wash my face. No alcohol!</li>
            <li> Love Thayer brand, won&#x27;t buy any others!</li>
            <li> My daughter thought she would try this product.  She love it.  No alcohol and her skin feel soft helps with keeping her skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I use it as a toner; so after cleansing and before moisturizing.  It helps combat the minor acne that I have and contributes to the overall balance of my skin.  The only thing that I have to mention is the smell.  This product has a strong, acidic cucumber scent that some people may find off-putting.</li>
            <li> Left my face looking oily. I&#x27;ve used other brands and they&#x27;ve never done that to me. I gave it away; it&#x27;s not that it was bad, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the cap was broken. The product smells weird, perhaps it&#x27;s the cucumber. I think it does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Like it!  Used for several years now.</li>
            <li> I think it helps.  My pores are less visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Thayer brand of toner for awhile now.  I tend to switch my toner up based on the time of the year and the cucumber witch hazel is what I go to in the Winter.  I have relatively sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  It&#x27;s worked well for me in combination with CeraVe foaming facial cleanser and Nivea sensitive facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good astringent,  smells nice</li>
            <li> I love to use these as toners in the summer.  They are cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty ritual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months. It has worked great for my oily skin; I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and less oiliness. I use it twice a day right after washing my face. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What it won&#x27;t do:&lt;br /&gt;- Dry your skin like alcohol&lt;br /&gt;- Damage your skin cells like most astringent brands that contain parabens, SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate and its naughty cousins) or other harsh ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Sit on your skin like a thin film, or take forever to absorb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it will do:&lt;br /&gt;- Lightly re-moisturize the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Mildly cleanse and tighten your pores (I experienced a tightening sensation the first week I used this, but this may not be the case for everyone, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to using harsher astringents)&lt;br /&gt;- Provide a refreshing cooling sensation (Oh! How wonderful this is if you experience hot flashes! Or, if you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s just shaved!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- I pour it into a mister for quick and easy application.&lt;br /&gt;- I apply to my face and neck after washing (sometimes I shower and spritz it onto my whole body after drying off)&lt;br /&gt;- I apply to any area I&#x27;ve just finished shaving (after washing off any soap/shaving cream residue)&lt;br /&gt;- I spritz anywhere on my body for a cooling sensation; very nice if I&#x27;ve been under the sun or was working-out and I&#x27;m super hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love it: It&#x27;s natural, mild but effective, and affordable - one bottle can last me 2 months of daily facial washes.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and crisp and neither feminine nor masculine; certainly not overbearing like some brands - making it a great option for males or females.</li>
            <li> I like cucumber over the rose and lavender.  The cucumber doesn&#x27;t smell as good but it doesn&#x27;t give me burning sensations to my face like the other two.  Face feels squeaky clean after using</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL ON MY FACE. I ORDERED THIS AND THE ROSE WATER, I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER, BUT BOTH ARE REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Everything is good, but, the smell is really ......... not good</li>
            <li> Pick this up in the summer, it might just be better than aloe. Keeps skin from peeling, and also cool and freshens skin. Only problem with this, as i find with most of thayer&#x27;s products is they clog my pores. Only a summer item!</li>
            <li> I like this toner, but not as much as the rose scent. For some reason the rose leaves my skin tighter and brighter looking.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin that is extremely difficult to keep  under control. However, this toner has helped me keep the oiliness and breakouts at bay. It  soothes and calms my skin and on top of that it&#x27;s not packed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great smell. I use this as a facial toner. I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately. I had a lot of comments the day after my first use. But it stopped giving me that glow now...I guess it&#x27;s just not potent enough. Still it is good. I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps. Love it!</li>
            <li> This one and the Rose one are my favorite. Very refreshing, thanks!</li>
            <li> Its arrived to me with broke</li>
            <li> It May Smell a little funny at first but you do get accustom to it. This makes my skin feel refreshed and cool and i use every night! I even added to my skin routine. i will be purchasing  this again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really enjoy the fresh scent and feeling on my face. It also helped alot when I had a bad sunburn on my face!</li>
            <li> Love this product. No alcohol, no strong or odd scent. Very soothing and gentle on our skin.My son has acne. This helps calm the irritation so the pimples can heal quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had to have a couple of surgical preps followed by a procedure and surgery. I had bought this earlier just to have on hand and it really came in handy during those events, when gentleness is essential.  I recently ran out and picked up some regular witch hazel to have while I&#x27;m waiting for this to come in.  There is a world of difference between the pharmacy house brand and Thayers.  Can&#x27;t wait for my re-order to arrive!  This is now an essential item in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> So refreshing! Why buy something expensive? This is a great astringent for the face with out over drying.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s products are great, and I especially love their Witch Hazel, which (no pun intended) I use daily to freshen and cleanse my skin before applying moisturizer. The cucumber is fine: I know many people consider it their favorite. My personal favorite is the lemon.</li>
            <li> i really like this product!!  it feels great on my skin and the best point is i believe it helps my whiteheads clear up!  which they are difficult to rid my face of!  however, i&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a cotton ball as my toner for a couple months now. I love it. It smells so fresh, reduces my pore size, and removes any leftover makeup that&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It heals and gives my skin a smooth texture.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used Thayer Witch Hazel products as an aftershave for many years. First time trying the Cucumber toner for that purpose. It works fairly well (better than the plain astringent witch hazel). I like that the scent isn&#x27;t too flowery or excessive. I do prefer that feel of the Lavender version; although, I can&#x27;t use that without thinking of my Grandmother!</li>
            <li> I really like the Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products.  In fact, we&#x27;re out now and my first order was cancelled, so I&#x27;m trying to find the fastest way to get more!  When I use them I can tell a big difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s healthier looking, more supple, the pores are clean.  The cucumber Thayer&#x27;s smells like... well, fresh cucumbers.  Go figure.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, but it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent, and I barely notice it now.  I use it as an aftershave, but I don&#x27;t just splash it on the beard area.  I use it on all exposed skin above the base of my neck (otherwise it would look funny to have  nice looking skin on my throat and cheeks, but nowhere else!).  I usually put i on damp skin, it seems to go on easier.  I follow it with Nivea Sensitive After Shave lotion, which I&#x27;ve used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An observation, it appears that the women who reviewed this didn&#x27;t seem as wow-ed by it as the guys are.  I wonder if it&#x27;s because women have used more skin products all their life, so they are used to having nice skin; and we guys, for the most part do not, so we&#x27;re amazed at the change when we use this stuff?</li>
            <li> It burns my face! It&#x27;s really disappointing especially after seeing so many good review, I was hoping this product could work on me too. By the way, I have combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Literally. This leaves my face feeling cool -- clean and fresh. It&#x27;s not drying or breaking out my combo and sensitive skin. And smells so good! So far I&#x27;m loving the way my skin feels with this. I will update if anything changes, good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a toner for nearly two months now, and I am really happy with it. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my (combination/oily) skin. I can&#x27;t say how well it works for acne or skin irritation since I am not prone to either, but it will definitely remove any residual makeup or residue on your face. The scent is light and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face. It smells a little different compared to many cucumber scented products on the market, but that might be because it is made with real cucumber and not a chemical-created scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about how I feel this is working on my skin.  It smells like fake cucumbers;  and it&#x27;s not an appealing smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was having some scalp issues (buildup, itching) and I poured this on my scalp and left it for a little bit and then washed it out.  There was a definite, positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;This did not dry out my skin and I will try another bottle on my skin, but I will always have some for my scalp</li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant. It seems there is a scent of soap water. Other than that, everything is good considering the price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of fresh cucumber scent and my face has really improved since using this product. My oiliness on my face has toned down, my pores are smaller, and my acne is improving a lot. I can tell it was from this product because since I added it into my regimen I can notice a difference in my face and I love it</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Use it to moisturize my face after shaving.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I make my own facial toner and I add this as one of the ingredients.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-drying and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> These Witch Hazel Brands are by far the best thing to use as a Facial Toner.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate and yet removes any traces of makeup you;ve left behind or just simply refreshes your skin.  I&#x27;ll never pay high dollar for Brand Name Toners again.</li>
            <li> Great product for the low price! Removes make up and impurities easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> This feels great but is not as much of an astringent as I am used to.  The cucumber scent is more petroleum based than vegetable based, so I was disappointed with that. It&#x27;s really quite difficult to smell the cucumber at all.  I will go back to the more expensive C.O. Bigelow Dr Galen Herbal Skin Tonic in the future.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, too scented. It is very sweet and cucumber smelly and I don&#x27;t like it at all. The product works well but I can&#x27;t deal with the scent. I&#x27;ll stick to the original Thayer&#x27;s with aloe.</li>
            <li> Already love witch hazel so aloe and cucumber make this extra great just to even swipe my face in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> Is so gentle i like it so much.</li>
            <li> Great toner for your skin and also an awesome salad dressing spritzer on a hot summer day.  Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had been using Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel for a while when I found Thayer&#x27;s undistilled witch hazel. I had read that undistilled witch hazel has more anti-inflammatory properties so I was really excited to try it. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cucumber scent is so unbelievably strong that it smells fake. It is so awful that it almost made me nauseous. Second, the product left a slightly sticky film on my skin which caused me to break out. If you look at the ingredients, there is more aloe vera than there is witch hazel. I believe that is what has clogged my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes have breakouts of eczema, and have found that this product works well for soothing and stopping the itching. It also works well on bug bites or other minor skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now gone back to using Dickinson&#x27;s Pore Perfecting Toner, which contains only witch hazel, 14% natural grain alcohol, and witch hazel extract and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Thayer&#x27;s undistilled witch hazel 4 stars for using on your body, and 2 stars for using on your face.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and soothing. I love it and my husband uses it after shaving too!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice, refreshing</li>
            <li> I like the listed ingredients, and the smell is acceptable (like a strong, real cucumber smell + some kind of medicine/sterile bandage type of smell combined). However, this irritates my face a little bit (slight burning) and I&#x27;m not sure it clears away impurities the way a toner with just a tad of alcohol would.</li>
            <li> I use it as a makeup remover and toner. I love it. I have acne prone, sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, it soothes and really cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> let me just say this is awesome</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have trouble/oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;It did improve my skin without making my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job what it says and the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Feels so nice after using. I&#x27;d get this again.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality product, fast delivery, free delivery</li>
            <li> Great product and exactly what I wanted alcohol free!</li>
            <li> great product great scent for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have acne prone skin and have tried high end and drugstore toners.  Some are too strong and some simply are not effective.  This toner is gentle and effective.  I love that it&#x27;s very reasonable and comes in a large bottle which lasts for many months!  Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really great (not too much, not too little, and it really smells natural.) I put some on my face after a workout and it really made everything feel cooler and fresh. I&#x27;ll be buying a second bottle before this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Really does shrink pores if used daily. Makes skin feel nice and soft. Doesn&#x27;t leave residu like some other products. Smells nice. My husband likes this and will use it because it&#x27;s not girly looking.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin really soft. And it smells GREAT... like a cucumber cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really helps with the dark circles under my eyes... soak a cotton ball and lather it up right under your eyes. Works great!</li>
            <li> Gives good clean feeling. Cucumber smell works well with the witch hazel. Witch hazel by itself has a very distinct smell, however it goes away once dried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner! Helps with clearing up my acne to a considerable level! Also love how it smells of fresh cucumbers!</li>
            <li> I love this product  - recommended by HeyFranHey.com.  It serves as a fantastic toner and I use it after washing my face, not even needing a moisturizer because it works so well (I do have oily/normal skin).  This will be a part of my face-cleansing routine for life!  I like the cucumber&#x27;s fresh scent, but if the smells bothers you, the scent does not last after application so no worries.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! I use it every night and make my skin feel so clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cucumber and it feels nice. It sure bests my last chemical toner. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Love it you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed my acne and pores have decrease tremendously.  And my scars are fading away leaving my face with an even tone</li>
            <li> Gentle but gets all the makeup off your skin that washing may have missed. Smell is light and no stinging or drying like other products that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the smell but the toner itself is absolutely great. Some reviewers said they breakout after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I actually have less acne. I guess everyone just has different skin types~ it&#x27;s the best toner I have used so far~ I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this cucumber one. I have used the rose, lavender and cucumber one to date and I still have to say that the rose is my favorite, but if my skin is feeling exceptionally dry I like to use the cucumber.</li>
            <li> This is the very best skin toner. It removed the reddness from my arm when I applied it. I will always buy this Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent keeps it from smelling like a medicine.  The strength seems on par with other witch hazel brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Thayers brand of witch hazel is amazing. For sensitive skin this is the holy grail. The cucumber aloe soothes so nicely</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, &amp; shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Great product! makes face feel soft and smooth without greasy residue. I do not have to use a moisturizer with it just spray on after a shower then i apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s is a go-to product for me and this scent is fantastic.  It truly smells like a freshly cut cucumber.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and came as expected but I found it doesn&#x27;t work as well for my skin as the rose one. Has a nice cucumber scent, but my skin just doesn&#x27;t look as nice with this. Will use it up and order the rose one. Overall I really like this brand and it feels like water on my face, great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like it, and the smell is not your fru fru cucumber that you get it BBW or VS.. this is the pure.. out of your grocery store green skin smell. And it does not linger. I like it. Its lighter that all other toners and my skin dont fell stripped. I like it</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love the cucumber scent.  This toner really cleans off what did not come off from the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Really works well to keep my dry, sensitive skin blemish free. Pores are smaller and my face just looks healthier since I began using this brand of witch hazel. I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Cheap, natural, and effective - this is a very nice product.  I also like the rose flavor - use that one in winter and the cucumber in summer.</li>
            <li> I ordered three different bottles of toner from three different merchants. This one was the only one that came in a zip lock bag. When I went to open it, the hermetically sealed foil part had a small pin hole. In a store I would not buy this. It looks like it was tampered with.</li>
            <li> nothing special, gets the job done. definitely not for acne prone skin though. the lemon one is better for acne prone and oily skin.</li>
            <li> A fine product for the price. Arrived fast. Package was neat and easy to open. This customer shops the market. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; makes my skin feel good also.&lt;br /&gt;Would gladly order this again, it&#x27;s a nice product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really liked the soft scent of these, and it works well in my homemade wipe solution!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Thayer and I like it.  Nice toner that doesn&#x27;t sting when you apply to the face.  The cucumber scent is refreshing, but light and not overpowering.  Perfect for use after the shower.  I apply this before I apply hylauronic gel or vitamin C serum, then sunblock, then do my makeup.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  Very refreshing.  I also like that it is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I&#x27;ve bought this and the rose scent.  I like both but prefer the cucumber.</li>
            <li> best astringent around. not harsh, picks up gunk i missed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing and soothing on my skin. And smells so light. I love it and will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> The combination of witch hazel and aloe makes a perfect cleansing product, soothing and effective.  The addition of cucumber makes it absolutely delicious.  It really smells exactly like fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It can be used several times a day and every time I use it my face feels so refreshed! I&#x27;m often surprised at what comes off my face when I think it&#x27;s clean.  I won&#x27;t use anything else anymore!</li>
            <li> I usually love the Rose Petal, but find this is better for skin redness!</li>
            <li> I bought the Rose and the Lavender months ago. I finally figured out what works for me and this is it. I no longer my wash face in the morning, instead I use this toner to cleanse and remove oils. Washing my face in the morning left my face too dry even for my oily skin, but this is perfect. I then go on with my makeup routine. At night I wash my makeup off and then exfoliate with St Ives apricot scrub. If I have a blemish or some sort of break out I use Acne Free Terminator 10 on problem areas. Afterwards, I use this toner again. Then I moisturize with either St Ives Timeless skin, or if I feel dry I use Aveeno smart essentials night time moisture infusion. (both are in jars) This may seem like a lot but it is worth it since my skin is now completely clear and smooth. This toner has definitely helped my routine. My skin wasn&#x27;t as clear as it is now until I started using this everyday. Like I said, I use the Rose one as well as the Lavender but I like the Rose one just a little bit more. I hope this helps anyone struggling with acne.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for.  Excellent post-shave toner.  Very soothing to freshly shaved skin.  No burn like alcohol-containing products, and the cucumber scent is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving - it keeps skin clear and soft without leaving a residue or shine. It smells faintly of cucumber but after a minute it&#x27;s totally odorless. I consider this a plus. It can be hard to find locally and the price is usually the same or better on amazon.  I apply daily and 1 container will last just over 2 months.  Try a bottle, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Have been using Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel as a facial toner after oil cleansing method (using LIfe-flo Oil Pure Almond). Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel astringent. I have very sensitive, combination skin and this acts as a nice toner. It&#x27;s not too drying, it seems to soothe my skin after washing. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.  On hot days, I use it during the day to stay refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. It smells great and is gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this product or any product with witch hazel.  So far I like it a lot.  I might try other Thayer products.</li>
            <li> I love the performance of Thayers witch hazel. I use it at least twice a day, definitely after every shave. It has helped remove some splotchy discoloration from my cheeks. I usually use the Unscented version, but figured I&#x27;d try the cucumber for something bright and uplifting to smell during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like cucumber, but it&#x27;s not as bright and refreshing as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s almost a bit musty at first. Certainly not something I&#x27;d call &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34;.  Not sure of its the scent quality, or maybe I don&#x27;t like cucumbers as much as I thought. Oh well... Thayers isn&#x27;t scented strong enough for other people to really smell you after a few seconds or so. The scent truly is for you alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The astringent and toning properties are so good that I&#x27;ll definitely use the bottle of cucumber regardless, because the scent doesn&#x27;t interfere too much. Plus, the scent that remains after 20-30 seconds is much lighter and more enjoyable before disappearing a few minute later.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is refreshing.  The flip top cap makes it easy to dispense a little squirt onto a cloth.</li>
            <li> My husband an I both use this and agree, the smell is not that good.  We can&#x27;t pinpoint what it does smell like but it&#x27;s not cucumber.  That being said, we love how the Witch Hazel cleans and makes our skin feel so soft.  I will definitely purchase again just in a different scent.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and clear!! I&#x27;ve had problem, oily/combination skin since FOREVER and this is the only product that helps. The rose scented one is a personal fave as well. I gave this to a bunch of my friends for a Favorite Things themed Christmas party and EVERYONE loved it. I have 0 complaints.</li>
            <li> Better than the lavender one</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Leaves my skin soft and moisturized. Added bonus is that it does not set you on fire like products with alcohol in it. Has a nice smell, and definitely not overpowering to leave you smelling like grandpa.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing lotion. I din&#x27;t see any changes for my pores.</li>
            <li> addicted to this stuff! has made my skin significantly better!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put it in my frig to keep it cool and after getting up or a shower use a cotton ball to cleanse my face. It smells wonderful and cleanse gently and thoroughly!.</li>
            <li> After I received this and tried it out, I realized that I have been pouring money down the drain purchasing way too expensive toners from other companies.  I can&#x27;t believe I just discovered this!  The toner has a wonderful cooling sensation, as a cucumber toner should, and it has all natural ingredients without alcohol and paraben!  And it leaves my face clean and refreshed just as well as the toners that I had been using before.  It&#x27;s definitely made me a fan!</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it,she has not use it yet.  I have no idea about it so far. I hope it as good as other products I ordered from you.</li>
            <li> Nice feel on the face after a shave, though can sometimes leave a sticky feeling.  Also the scent (which smells closer to dead flowers than cucumber) is not too strong, yet lingers longer than you might expect.  If I were to buy this product again I&#x27;d go with an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of Thayer&#x27;s Cucumber Witch Hazel along with the Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Aloe Pads. [[ASIN:B00137P2QG Thayers Original Witch Hazel with Organic Aloe Vera Formula Astringent Pads 60 ea]]. While I like both products, I think I liked the Original Witch Hazel with Aloe the best. One bottle is for my husband to use in his semi to freshen up between showers. It is a very good product, but it has a faint sweetness to it which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I does feel fantastic on your skin after a shower - makes my face feel moisturized without any oil or lotions.</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade Bug Spray.  I also use it on my face after cleaning. Works great and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I always hated toners. Until this one. Does the job and no drying and smells great. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Thayer has excellent toner - I especially love the Cucumber Witch Hazel as it is gentle on sensitive skin and very cooling. I notice the difference when I skip out on the toner as it gently exfoliates the skin and removes whatever dirt and oil my cleanser might have missed. I also tried the Rose Witch Hazel, but I think the Cucumber one is better on my skin as I tend to have sensitive, rosacea-prone skin. Good price, and very good quality.</li>
            <li> this is my first foray into toner and this stuff is amazing! it&#x27;s not drying at all and the cucumber smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts. This didn&#x27;t work that well with my skin. I would used it twice a day after washing my face. But just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months after using this my skin has improved but not because of this. I would recommend people that suffer from acne to incorporate zinc supplements into your diet. I had horrible, painful cysts on my chin for MONTHS but after i started taking zinc I don&#x27;t get those horrible, painful breakouts on my chin anymore.</li>
            <li> Super gentle but moisturizing. I can&#x27;t live without it now. I also love the scent: a hint of cucumber but not too much. Def worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Love all Thayer toners, and this one is super refreshing! Will definitely buy again and recommend to everyone for daily use!</li>
            <li> Great service,very good product-almost impossible to find skin care products without alcohol,so I am very pleased with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> IM INLOVE WITH THIS TONER LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!!</li>
            <li> It feels and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> If you have large facia pores, you have to use this and will notice a difference in less than 7 days!!</li>
            <li> What I expected, an excellent product</li>
            <li> Great product and smells nice like cucumber. I use it after I shave and it helps keeps my shin soft. A+++</li>
            <li> Smells so very fresh with the cucumber.</li>
            <li> Great stuff; very soothing. Provides a refreshing lift midday; I use a cotton swab and swipe my face Round 1pm and am rewarded with a calming fresh feeling</li>
            <li> The shop shipped me a wrong product, but I decided to try it anyways. I just started to use it for a week or so, it&#x27;s not as &#x27;magical&#x27; as I thought ir would be. But it moisturizes me skin real well.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it to help make/dilute herbal blends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months.  Feels amazing. Natural, nondrying, cool, refrshing &amp; cleansing.  Nice to keep in frig to close poors after cleansing.</li>
            <li> A few times a year I treat myself to a facial.  The last couple of years the word &amp;#34;dehydrated&amp;#34; keeps coming up regarding my skin.  Apparently, I was still treating my skin like a teenager&#x27;s skin, and 40 year old skin is different.  The aesthetician told me the toner I was using was too harsh and recommended a different brand, but also said witch hazel and cucumber are good and soothing and non drying for the skin.  I looked up the reviews of the brand toner she recommended and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  I found this toner which had good reviews and is way less expensive.  I like it, it is cooling when applied, and the bottle will last awhile.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling refreshed and hydrated after a shave. This product is also a good value and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it does the job. I do not like the scent tho. That is the only reason I am not using it. I will order the lavender scented one next time. But my husband use it and it works great as a toner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my face! Found this from heyfranhey and her amazing youtube channel. It does not dry out my skin or break me out. This helps get all the dirt off of my face and treat my acne!</li>
            <li> Thayers witch hazels are the best.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make &amp;#34;pad-sicles&amp;#34;...I&#x27;m in my eighth month of pregnancy and from I&#x27;ve read, this witch hazel is the best for postpartum recovery. I have used it as a toner in the meantime though and love it! It smells much better than plain witch hazel and love that it has aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and not flirting to the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite . Keep an extra bottle on hand, so I&#x27;ll never run out. Great on the face, refreshing and smells wonderful after a shave.</li>
            <li> Tocophery Acetate is in so many things and it can cause horrible damage to the skin and to the person’s self image. It should be banned.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Must have for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot during the summer or for redness on my skin.  Use all toners after a fresh, clean, exfoliated skin.  I use Konjac sponges to exfoliate and I notice that my toner does much better having exfoliated.  Summertime here is humid and so I use this for humid months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear aftershaves as a rule, and while this product doesn&#x27;t necessarily represent itself to be an aftershave, that&#x27;s how I use it.  It cools and calms my face after a close shave.  It feels refreshing and I find the cucumber scent to come across as clean and natural, not heavy and perfumed as seems to be the case with most alcohol-based aftershaves.  The mild scent is not one that lingers either and that&#x27;s a trait I look for in all grooming products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t apply this with a cotton ball as seems to be the norm after reading through some of these reviews.  I just cup my hand, squirt some in my palm, and pat it on my face in the areas I just shaved.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, just during those times when my skins feels sensitive or irritated.  I prefer this version, but if it&#x27;s not available I default to the [[ASIN:B000S823S6 Thayer Original Witch Hazel, 12 Fluid Ounce]].  Although neither of these next two versions are of interest to me, there is also a [[ASIN:B000PP15L8 Toner Lavender Witch Hazel Alcohol-Free Thayer 12 oz Liquid]] and a [[ASIN:B00016XJ4M Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz]] that might be options worth considering for those who don&#x27;t enjoy this cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> The smell on this is awesome. It&#x27;s not like the normal muted cucumber scent you&#x27;d expect from most other products. This actually smells like someone went out to the garden and picked a cucumber and shoved it into the bottle. Works great as well. I use it as aftershave and it definitely helps with irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> I started out using the Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Toner, which I absolutely loved!! But with my insane skin problems: acne, eczema, scarring, premature lines, I thought maybe this Cucumber &amp; Aloe would be better to keep my oily skin down..I WAS RIGHT!! Ever since I had my kids, I suffer from acne more in my middle age than I ever did as a teen!! This toner really refreshes, cools the skin, and seems to balance the oil production. Although I loved the Rose Petal, this by far beats it! I feel like I have come out of a high end spa, with fresh slices just taken off of my eyes. You will not regret ladies!!</li>
            <li> Great product and smells cucumbery fresh!</li>
            <li> Love the cucumber scent. Also very cooling and soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. This product makes my face feel refreshed and does not leave my face dry. Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> I adore the Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel. I wanted to try this scent and it did not disappoint. Not too strong and the witch hazel is the same so I am glad I ordered it. I would recommend that you order this brand for its soothing witch hazel content and combine with your favorite scent or keep it plain, either way, I believe this is great quality vs other brands that are cheaper. A bit pricy but it last for a long time and worth the money for its quality witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Good value, good product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all and feels so refreshing like your own little spa treatment at home.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner at very inexpensive price. I used this brand before, in rose petal &amp; lavender and cucumber is also very good. So refreshing and moist!</li>
            <li> Purchased this &amp; aloe vera gel to make &amp;#34;frozen padsicles&amp;#34; to use after delivery (episiotomy/tear). The product is alcohol free which is important in order to avoid a stinging effect and the cucumber scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> I had been buying this brand @ a local store until they stopped carrying it. This is my first time trying the Cucumber. This product is great after I come back from hiking and my face is wind burnt. I also use it every morning. After shaving, it helps to relieve any irritation on my neck. I really like the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice aroma, my husband likes it after he shaves. Packaging was great -- it arrived in good shape and the product looked new and clean.</li>
            <li> I love it! I mix it with a tea tree and vitamin E on a cotton ball and gives me glowy skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried so many different toners, they either leave my face dry or sticky. This toner is amazing, its so calming and my skin is prone to redness. Love!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and had been having a lot of flare ups on my face lately and tried everything. I read about using witch hazel, non- alcohol, and decide to try it. In less than a week, my skin looks better than it has in years without any irritation. I use this on a cotton ball all over and then apply unpetroleum jelly, found on Anazon also, and Too Faced beauty balm for my makeup. My skin feels and looks great. My husband uses this witch hazel and has noticeable differences in fine lines and his pores are almost invisible. It&#x27;s worth every penny, and makes up for it in not having to buy multiple serums and treatments for each of our needs.</li>
            <li> Product arrived well paxkaged, as described. Thank you !</li>
            <li> not a fan of its scent, and I did&#x27;t see its effect on acne as many reviews here mentioned. I&#x27;ll probably try another one of this series next time</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is gentle and smells great.  Can reapply many times throughout the day to refresh.</li>
            <li> The smell alone should make you buy this. It smells so good and leaves my skin refreshed. I use this on my face and back as that&#x27;s where I break out the most. This, along with occasional spot treatment, has cleared my acne right up! I keep getting compliments on how great my skin looks and I am positive this toner is responsible for that.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have used the rose witch hazel in the past and I loved it, decided to try the cucumber one and the smell is just not for me. I think it smells horrendous and I will be giving this away to a friend just because I can&#x27;t use it. Now I would rate the rose one 5 stars because the smell is nice. If you really love the smell of cucumber you might like this, it was just too much for me. But I think besides the smell this is a good product and it works. Will be ordering the rose one instead.</li>
            <li> My face feels so cool and refreshed after using this! It&#x27;s not drying, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It also smells like actual cucumbers, not like the sweetened cucumber scent that&#x27;s often in cucumber products. The natural scent is relaxing, and it fades quickly so it isn&#x27;t overpowering. This is by far the most moisturizing, soothing toner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like stale cucumbers and feet. It does feel nice though.</li>
            <li> I love all the Thayer witch hazels. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love Witch Hazel and now especially this Cucumber one. Energizes in the morning. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and a lot of toners out there are too drying, which makes my skin over produce oil causing more breakouts. Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel is very soothing for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. I like the refreshing feeling it leaves my skin. Love that every ingredient is derived from natural sources using organic aloe and organic witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I use this as my face toner and the cucumber scent is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Thayer&#x27;s lavander witch hazel in the past but this is the only one I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use it daily without any break outs or irritations. I highly recommend this product to be included in anyone&#x27;s daily facial regiment.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile lotion. I use it after the oil method cleaning at night (it works well as an extra step to remove any make-up or dirt leftover), and also nice as a toner.  My skin is prone to be dry, but this lotion hydrates. And although other reviewers are complaining about the smell, it certainly not strong.  It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> All natural, great cucumber smell, no residue, feels great.  I use it almost every day (daily if not rushed).  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have artificial chemicals.  I never used aftershave before, but my face simply feels better after using it.  The scent dissipates within minutes (even seconds) so it won&#x27;t interfere with any cologne.</li>
            <li> So I figured that it might smell like cucumber-melon scented things, or perhaps have a hint of a garden scent, but no.  This smells EXACTLY like a cucumber!  Which happen to be my favorite fruit, so I don&#x27;t mind applying it.  Also, the restorative and healing properties are fantastic, without the alcohol sting that is present in so many other products.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great, I no longer have to purchase from so called &amp;#34;kitchen cosmetic&amp;#34; businesses for this stuff which charge way more.</li>
            <li> Cleanses and refreshes the skin.  Not drying, very soothing.  They only thing that I do not like is the smell, very strong.  Fades once the product dries though.</li>
            <li> i like it, it nice to try. And it is alcohol free, nice for my skin，the smell is nice. Ha</li>
            <li> I Like this but like the rose better. This brand is the best. Will not be without Thayers toner as it does an excellent gob without stinging. Face feels calm afer using. Good job Thayers!</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product and I decided to try it out. I use it with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser. It works perfectly! leaving my skin soft and evening out my tone! Will definitely stock up and continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> First of all， Shipping soon  and  it&#x27;s  Very moisturizing lotion,so  i love it .</li>
            <li> Great natural astringent. Non-drying and leaves the skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> received this item sooner then anticipated, love this stuff!! tried the rose petal? prior to the cucumber, cant decide which one is better as far as smell goes. they all have a &amp;#34;crisp clean&amp;#34; smell to them and they are definitely not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this product after my morning shave to rinse my face. I use it after I rinse with water and before my after shave lotion  and it feels great!</li>
            <li> Great product great company...to many words and i just really don&#x27;t have more to say but they want a review</li>
            <li> A refreshing astringent that makes your face feel cool and renewed. The cucumber smell is noticeable and I liked that.</li>
            <li> helps your face feel fresh clean and smooth and you noticed a younger look, I even noticed the difference on my moms face</li>
            <li> The cooling effect lasts longer than I expected! Cucumber is awesome thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hyper pigmentation. Regular witch hazel seemed too harsh and would actually cause me to break out a little. This mix is prefect for removing dirt and oil from my face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this over plain witch hazel for those with sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to redness.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong cucumber smell until it dries, but it soothes on contact and leaves my skin in wonderful condition! After reading the many and varied uses for witch hazel (some of which include: heat rash, poison ivy, boils, insect bites, and as an astringent to shrink pores) I think I need to buy this product in several varieties and always keep it in stock!</li>
            <li> High quality witch hazel. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Needed something gentle to wipe down before applying makeup. Works for what I need and doesnt irritate my skin. Havent been using it long enough to determine if it will reduce my acne or not but it does seem less red than usual. My face dislikes being washed more than once a day so this is a nice way to freshen up. Really does smell like a fresh cut cucumber, a nice unisex scent that doesnt last much past application.</li>
            <li> This product is refreshing in the summer time! In terms of improving my skin I don&#x27;t know about that but it does feel great and it is a great way to freshen up after being outside in the hot humid weather or after a shower! The cucumber smell is strong but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Used as a toner, face felt refreshed after use. Seems okay but I haven&#x27;t been consistent with this product.</li>
            <li> Works okay, not as well as the original witch hazel</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in some areas, but if I use a even a light moisturizer it makes my face oily with patches that are still cracked and peeling. My skin is also very sensitive to cleansing products, which usually make my skin peel or crack. This product was amazing in that usually after using it I either didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer at all, or just a  very small amount. And it smells like cucumbers! My skin texture is way more even. It always feels refreshing and it locks natural moisture into your skin effectively. Definitely recommend this product over other toners, especially for sensitive or combination skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for combination skin.  Feels very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the wonders of this stuff and am glad to have it as part of my postpartum care collection. The smell is fresh and will provide healing properties as well as soothing properties with the addition of cucumber.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and amazing!  Love that the witch hazel is potent in this... I use it after cleansing to get my face extra clean!!  The cucumber smells incredible.  I can tell that this product is going to become a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Bleh. Love the rose... but unless you REALLY and I mean REALLLLY like cucumber you will probably find this mixture overwhelming. You open it, put it on a pad and BAM! Your nostrils are smacked with cucumber... its so bad you don&#x27;t want to put it on your face for fear the smell will stick around your nose and make you toss chunks. Lol. Still works well thus why I gave it a three, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I regularly use (and love) Thayer Lavender Witch Hazel, but the reviews were so good about this product, Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel with Aloe, that I decided to try it. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it. I have no doubt that it will work OK as a toner, but I don&#x27;t like the aroma, what there is of it. It does (surprise!) smell just like fresh cucumbers. So if don&#x27;t mind smelling like a cucumber, this may be just the toner for you!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this witch hazel!  It is the perfect facial toner.  I have tried many expensive toners (Clinique, Mary Kay, Estee Lauder, etc.) in the past and this exceeds all of them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this buy! It was my first time purchasing it. It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Love the fresh cucumber smell. I use it daily sand after a clay facial.</li>
            <li> They say witch hazel is really good for your skin so I bought clay and mix this with the clay and make my own mask and it works great!</li>
            <li> I reeeally wanted to love this cucumber toner; it smells great and I love the look of it. HOWEVER, I ignored all of the reviews warning me that it would break me out. Afterall, I don&#x27;t have breakouts, and I only get an occasional little zit like twice a year from hormonal stuff. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have that issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, welcome to my PIZZAFACED NIGHTMARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have HUGE boil-like zits all over my face and neck! The type of zits that grow fangs and hiss at the sunlight, and I need an effing priest to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think that you&#x27;re immune to giant, spastic, takes-three-weeks-to-get-rid-of zits, then more power to you, my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off giving this crap as a stocking stuffer to your worst mortal enemy.</li>
            <li> I own a salon and have this on my backbar. Its great to use before and after waxing or during facials. Clients love the cucumber scent and I love that it has no artificial fragrance, and that it cleanses and soothes the skin. We use a high end line for our facials and this toner is comparable to another toner we have on backbar that we pay 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li> If you love cucumber you&#x27;ll love this.  It keeps my face bright and toned and keeps the oil in check. The smell also is a great pick me up. I actually keep a little spray bottle with me and spray it over my makeup or bareface throughout the day. I&#x27;ll use this stuff as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can tell the quality is so much better than what I normally buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of smooth and soft. I like this shopping model  I choose this brand again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this formula!!  I keep it in the frig!  Great for cooling down your skin on a hot day or night!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Will continue to use twice a day,</li>
            <li> used it once and hated it. The smell was not my favor and it just dried up my face even more.</li>
            <li> It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne. I use this in place of a cream moisturizer after washing my face and it works nicely. My face is soft and moisturized throughout most of the day. Doesn&#x27;t do much for my random pimples though.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased. Really reasonably priced for the size of bottle and feels nice on the skin. Don&#x27;t love the cucumber scent. Will probably go lavender next time. Was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, in fact it&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
            <li> I had a rush after the first use</li>
            <li> Very gentle and refreshing. Great also as a midday toner if you don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toner.  It smells great and feels so soothing on my face.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as amazon is selling it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fresh and I like the smell of cucumber. Great product I definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells nice and leaves my skin clean and soft without over-drying. I use it to make face masks as well with bentonite clay and neem powder.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean feeling and great scent</li>
            <li> Nice usual Witch Hazel product and this Alcohol-Free Toner is a kind and goes smooth on my skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great smell. I use this as a facial toner. I think it has some sort of natural acid that made my face have a nice glow immediately. I had a lot of comments the day after my first use. But it stopped giving me that glow now...I guess it&#x27;s just not potent enough. Still it is good. I rub it all over my legs after I epilate them because it gets them nice and clean to prevent bumps. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as an alternative to my cheap T.N.Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel which I use as an aftershave lotion.  At first I was not sure if I liked it as well, but after using it for a while, I find it pleasant and soothing...the natural cucumber smell was odd at first but I&#x27;ve come to like it quite well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great, it&#x27;s alcohol free (the one that I ordered was, anyway) and it feels nice on my face. There are no icky ingredients, either - just as nature intended. I can&#x27;t wait to try the peach version.</li>
            <li> used this in the past without issue, but this time it seems to excessively burn and redden my skin, also smells like a salad...went back to the aloe only formula which gives me no such problems. it does work despite my reaction to it, my skin was tight and clean and no razor burn afterwards,</li>
            <li> I love this. Even better than my usual go-to, the rose flavored one.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product or anything made by Thayer.  I use it on my face after I&#x27;ve washed it with a facial cleanser.  I like the way my skin feels after using it.  I plan to purchase another toner by Thayer and I&#x27;m willing to try a stronger one (with alcohol) next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for dry skin! I use it as a toner after I wash my face at the end of the day. It takes away all the stress and filth of the day lol! I mean what more can I say. Great toner and affordable price :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it daily on my face instead of toner and use it on my toddler too. Witch hazel is great for you but often stinks. This is a perfect fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li> Thayers are my holy grail toners! Love Thayers products but this particular fragrance is not my favorite! Great for skin without being harsh (has no alcohol) though.</li>
            <li> softening yes, however, upon smelling the scent of cucumber is usually quite refreshing, but the smell that lingers after the formula has dried. it smells like someone licked your face with a mouthfull of bad breath. i cant say i appreciate the smell. the shipping was very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> Great product - I originally purchased the Rose Witch Hazel which I really loved. Wanted to try the Cucumber because Cucumber offers a soothing quality to calming skin. I prefer the Rose fragrance, but both are really excellent. Will always keep a stock in house.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and feels refreshing, but I don&#x27;t think it particularly helped as a facial toner.  I&#x27;ll keep it on hand to put on sunburn in the summer.</li>
            <li> I was using the unscented product to soften the puffiness around my eyes in the mornings.  It gives me a refreshing feeling and does the trick.  Puffiness is gone.  But I like the fresh scent this product has, over the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage son to use as a toner for his oily skin to prevent break outs. It works great for him. Great product!! Great seller!!</li>
            <li> This is a vital part of my skin care routine. I use this with a textured cotton pad after washing my face. I used to get painful pimples that took forever to heal but after incorporating this step, my face has been clear of all pimples.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it. But I think this is a really good product it cleans up make up really well and hasn&#x27;t messed up my skin.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this as a toner.  It is not a toner!  Witch hazel is used in toner.  Smells great but does not work as a toner.  I love The Body Shop Tea a Tree toner, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> Great product , I will be buying this again. Fast shipment also.</li>
            <li> This makes a great facial toner!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;TRUE&amp;#34; cuccumber toner for over 5 years!  This is it!  Smells great and is very gentle to older skin.  Great seller and quick shipping.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I originally tried Thayer&#x27;s rose scented toner because it was the cheapest. It&#x27;s a superior solution that works well to dry up acne and soothe irritation on my combination skin. When the bottle ran out I decided to try this variety and I&#x27;m glad I did. The scent is precisely rooted in natural cucumber scent and I love it. It smells just as good going on. It makes it easier for me to extract a few pores after I work a little on my skin. The twelve ounce size is a good value as well ringing in at just under ten bucks. I could probably find this in a store but there&#x27;s no guarantee they&#x27;d have this scent over, say, the original kind.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this!  It smells fresh.  Our faces feel clean and it doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It is very mild, and nourishing. I have rosecea which makes my skin very sensitive, this Witch Hazel calmed some of the redness after the first couple uses. I hope it continues to help my skin but at least for now it is a welcomed addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The other reviews on this product have been pretty amusing, I never thought about guys using toner, but this stuff works so well everyone should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 30 year old girl who does not use anything but moisturizer, so yes if you use a lot of other skin products this might not make such a huge difference for you, but it did for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night after washing my face.  4 days in and I can already see a huge difference.  My skin just looks...better, not sure specifically what is different other than the blackheads - which are already visably reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it goes away quickly and I can deal for such good results.  The other good thing about this toner is the price.  I will be buying more when I run out, which won&#x27;t be any time soon because second bonus: the bottle is quite large.</li>
            <li> Products are so good to use everyday after cleaning the face, even for hands..... but prices not really good deal.</li>
            <li> Very gentle toner.  Love the fresh smell.  Will continue to use, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to use in place of alcohol on his skin. I thought the cucumber scent would be refreshing. He hates it &amp; won&#x27;t use the product because he says it smells bad. I would not go that far. I don&#x27;t think it smells bad but it&#x27;s not what I thought it would be either. A friend of mine had the Thayer witch hazel with lemon &amp; it was wonderful. The cucumber doesn&#x27;t have that same refreshing scent. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I had smelled it first. Point is, my husband won&#x27;t use it &amp; I bought it for him. I don&#x27;t want to use it either b/c I don&#x27;t like the cucumber scent.&lt;br /&gt;Going to call Amazon to see if they will replace this another Thayer witch hazel product. If they do, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased that I&#x27;m using this now.  The smell of cucumber is actually nice(even tho I don&#x27;t like cucumbers at all) and my skin feels soft and awesome after applying it.  Other toners make my skin red and this doesn&#x27;t so this one is the one to keep.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff twice a day and can&#x27;t go with out it, and I&#x27;m someone who isn&#x27;t fussy about a daily routine. The cucumber is the best imo, so fresh and cooling. It&#x27;s great for people who live in areas where the weather changes drastically between seasons. It&#x27;ll save your skin. I also used this in a home made baby wipe solution (along with Diaper Lotion Potion concentrate), and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love  love love this product! Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin at all and leaves it moisturized and smelling like cucumbers. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell but it smells like cucumber like it is stated.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does smell like cucumber which I like.  Before I bought, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the cucumber smell while I was imagining something chemical smell of cucumber.  But I was wrong, it just smells like fresh cucumber which is refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  So far, I like it especially in summer time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. Makes my skin feel extra moisturized before I apply lotion.:)</li>
            <li> I love this face tonic ! It leaves my face feeling baby smooth soft even before I apply my moisturizer. I use it right after cleansing with my Clarisonic. I have been using it for weeks and it never leaves my skin feeling dry. I highly recommed.</li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel, so I thought I&#x27;d try out the cucumber scent. This caused a mild burning, irritating sensation on my skin that I didn&#x27;t like. I am not going to finish the bottle. The scent is nice, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with the rose.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and refreshed. The cucumber scent is very light, not over powering. The cap has a tiny hole so it comes out slowly, no wasting of the product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I needed to quickly get some more witch hazel, as I love its use as an astringent. This particular product, which includes cucumbers, works excellent. It is the same as regular witch hazel, but a bit more refreshing, which makes it more enjoyable to use, and gives me a nice wake-up feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li> The best thing to use as a toner</li>
            <li> I purchased this because due to a recommendation and found that I really like it. I thought Witch Hazel only came in full strength, but this brand really feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> The smell was not my favorite. I prefer the rose.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use as a gentle aftershave.  He hasn&#x27;t touched it, but I&#x27;m loving it!  It&#x27;s very fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with bonking line bumps after shaving. I had done a ton of research and found that witch hazel, aloe, and cucumber along with being alcohol free were the best thing for those itchy, ugly bumps... Well I was very disappointed! It didn&#x27;t help at all. I may try it as a toner when my other one runs out. The shipping and packing was perfect but the product did not work for what I intended.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, no burn and get for the skin.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and morning after washing my face. It always leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I was really shocked when I opened this bottle, because it smells like fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol. I have noticed that it stings your eyes if you get it to close but it really helps your skin. Beware of the eyes though!</li>
            <li> Thayers is the best witch hazel on the market. Period. The cucumber scent is light and fades quickly so it won&#x27;t clash with your fav aftershave.</li>
            <li> I used this one been a while .Is do what does the job .Is cheaper .better than buy some expensive one at the mall</li>
            <li> It arrived undamaged and sealed in a plastic bag. The size was bigger than I was expecting which is great. It has a definite cucumber smell and it&#x27;s refreshing when I use it. So far it does seem to help with my complexion.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without toner! Cleans and refreshes my skin without drying me out.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice scent - clean and refreshing. The alcohol free formula is also refreshing and soothing. This works great for an aftershave astringent. The 5 star rating is for fulfilling my needs and then some. The product I ordered showed up on the estimated date. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure what I&#x27;m supposed to use this for.  Like, do I put it on my face? When?  Anyway, it smells pretty good.  Once I figure out what it is I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Love all of Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toners, but this is my favorite. The cucumber is refreshing, calming and would work well for men, as well as women (me.) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol, means no burning skin. Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To note ... although, I love the scent of roses, I find the Rose Thayer&#x27;s to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> my skin broke out from this toner. but this doesnt mean its a bad product. my skin just didnt like the aloe in the product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. Definitely a staple in my bathroom cabinet. It smells amazing and leaves my skin soo smooth!</li>
            <li> The best facial toner ever!!! I did a lot of research on high quality, natural and organic toners and this IS the best!!!  Smells divine, feels wonderful; will be a staple in my medicine cabinet for the rest of my life!!!  Great for sun-burns and other skin issues too.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and awesome product! My skin feels wonderful</li>
            <li> It is a good toner, but I am not thrilled with it either. I soak it with compressed masks, it works good.</li>
            <li> It is just OK, not good for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great with my rosacea and sensitive skin. Smells really fresh and feels cool to the touch! Great to put on my face first thing in the morning and as it is really refreshing! I tried also the rose one before, but I really like the cucumber the best!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle cap came cracked, if I open the seal the solution could spill, its very inconvenient....</li>
            <li> This cucumber witch hazel with aloe vera is wonderful for a toner and makeup remover.  It smells so fresh, it does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin. And you get a nice big bottle with a pinhole dispenser top.  Easy to control usage.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting, it smells wonderful and leaves my face feeling great!</li>
            <li> you dont smell like a cucumber for long, and the scent is mild anyway. it really does cool those hot spots on your neck!</li>
