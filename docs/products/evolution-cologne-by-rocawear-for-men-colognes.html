            <li>Thanks for offering such an impressive product!</li>
            <li>I have tried this for the very first time, but didn&#x27;t regret of buying it.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased Evolution when I ran out of my day-to-day cologne and found that it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I work in healthcare, so I have to be careful what I wear, and this scent is perfect and light enough so that it does not bother my patients.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and smells good.</li>
            <li>The price is already well below what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I got the gift set for no extra cost from the seller which was nice.</li>
            <li>The price is right as I&#x27;ve paid $60 for it at the BX/PX</li>
            <li>He loves it and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I love this spray and was even more pleasantly surprised at the scent especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell , unexpected how much I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume very much.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Rocawear fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me very much of Red for Men but more woodsy.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly the way it looked on the site and smelled exactly like its supposed to.</li>
            <li>reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Rocawear Evolution is as follows (scoring is out of</li>
            <li>My wife loves it so much....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this rockawear fragrance for a year and like the way it smells, it really has a rugged spice smell that women seem to like on me.</li>
            <li>so I doubt it will be around much longer.</li>
            <li>The shower gel doesn&#x27;t foam up at all,  the aftershave is really greasy.</li>
            <li>mainly for going out , it does lasts for 2-3 hours which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>it has sort of a rum scent in the notes and it blends with your skin very well, i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This one is highly recommended - the fragrance is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A high quality project at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the above performance measures are those that are important to me, they may be less important to others.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of an old scent called &amp;#34;Santa Fe&amp;#34;, but with a modern kick.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and now it is my everyday cologne.  </li>
            <li>If you are shopping and have the opportunity to try a new fragrance and like it, buy it.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it is made with cheap ingredients that do not last long after spraying it on.</li>
            <li>Wow Factor:  </li>
            <li>but it barely lasts 2 hours.</li>

            <li> Love it...theres nothing like it</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Rocawear fragrances.  Evolution is a very pleasant scent that is a great buy.  Evolution is a great blend of woods, spice, and floral that is easy on the nose.  Very pleasant..!! I wish it lasted longer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Rocawear Evolution is as follows (scoring is out of 5 stars - 1 star is low, 3 is average, and 5 stars is best):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Appeal/Uniqueness of Scent:  5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Wow Factor:  4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Projection: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Longevity: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Appropriate season/event (versatility) for fragrance: 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Quality/design of bottle and packaging:  3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Price/Value: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Total Points:  27 points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ø  Average Score: 3.8 points (or stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: Evolution is a great fragrance that is unique.  The bottle is small enough to take with you and reapply as needed.  This one is highly recommended - the fragrance is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the above performance measures are those that are important to me, they may be less important to others.  If you are shopping and have the opportunity to try a new fragrance and like it, buy it.  Life is short - go for it..!!  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Evolution 3.8 stars, out of 5.  It is a great fragrance at a great price.  Needs improved longevity.</li>
            <li> This item smells great and exceeded my expectations in terms of both quality and price.A high quality project at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> smells good and good quality and good price</li>
            <li> My son loves this and he smells so good. The price is right as I&#x27;ve paid $60 for it at the BX/PX</li>
            <li> I love this spray and was even more pleasantly surprised at the scent especially for the price. It reminds me very much of Red for Men but more woodsy. I get compliments on this scent every time that I wear it and it stays on my clothes all day!! I have always loved men&#x27;s colognes more than women&#x27;s and this one is no exception. It is great to be asked by men and women what I am wearing. Since I am a woman, they are always puzzled by my fragrances because they are never too sweet or too strong and I never smell too fruity or flowery like most women&#x27;s scents. I would buy this scent over and over again!!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased Evolution when I ran out of my day-to-day cologne and found that it was no longer available.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as I had never heard of Evolution or Rocawear, and did not know of the connection to Jay Z.  I love this scent and now it is my everyday cologne.  Not a day goes by that someone approaches me to tell me how great I smell.  I work in healthcare, so I have to be careful what I wear, and this scent is perfect and light enough so that it does not bother my patients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this rockawear fragrance for a year and like the way it smells, it really has a rugged spice smell that women seem to like on me.</li>
            <li> I am kinda a cologne snob. I hate cheap smelling, quickly fading cologne. Even though the price was cheap I thought I would go online and check out the reviews. Almost all the cologne forums (yeah, they have forums) talked about how surprisingly good this cologne was for a celebrity product. Based on the majority positive reviews I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that they were right. It&#x27;s a quality fragrance. It seems like a fall fragrance to me (it&#x27;s not too light) and the fragrance lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that this fragrance did not sell to well so I doubt it will be around much longer. The price is already well below what it&#x27;s worth. If it&#x27;s available, buy it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell , unexpected how much I&#x27;d like it. Got a lot of compliments from women on the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband received a sample in Macy&#x27;s Dept. Store and I told him to buy it.  It was over $50 at Macy&#x27;s.  I looked on-line and this was the least expensive site to buy this item.  He loves it and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I got the gift set for no extra cost from the seller which was nice. It included shower gel and aftershave, both of which were useless. The shower gel doesn&#x27;t foam up at all,  the aftershave is really greasy. As far as the cologne, it smells great 7.5/10 but it barely lasts 2 hours. Projection is average. 3/5 stars, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ive ever used my wife loves the smell</li>
            <li> Great value and great quality item. Item was exactly the way it looked on the site and smelled exactly like its supposed to. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> this cologne is awesome. it has sort of a rum scent in the notes and it blends with your skin very well, i would highly recommend.</li>
