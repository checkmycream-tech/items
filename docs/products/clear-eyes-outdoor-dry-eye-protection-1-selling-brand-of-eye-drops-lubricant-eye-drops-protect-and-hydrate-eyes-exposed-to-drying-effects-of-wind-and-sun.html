    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is actually very good and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>And it works about as good as getting Vicks VapoRub on your fingers and sticking them in your eye.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the burning sensation but, to be fair,  </li>
            <li>I passed over the brand that my eye doctor recommends and even laughed that I fell for the marketing ploy of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I love it, lol.</li>
            <li>have tried many eye drops, best one every used, really made my eyes  feel great.</li>
            <li>Causes more burning and irritation than it relieves!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing them more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I picked these out because I liked the idea of a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>My symptoms were mild and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, and great price.</li>
            <li>Love these eye drops and when I was recently able to grab 6 boxes of the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I love when eye-drops work.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to be using them any more after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again because I&#x27;m not a pain-in-my-eye kind of person, but these are cheap and if you don&#x27;t mind stinging when you put drops in your eyes these could be for you.</li>
            <li>I also like this product because it does not contain any antihistamine as most eye drops do.  </li>
            <li>It may not work for other people, but the best to me.</li>
            <li>Now that my eyes adapted to the drops, I really enjoy the cooling effect.</li>
            <li>The cooling feeling is a bit strong at the first try, but after times, I get so comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>It does sting right after you put it in, but then it truly provides cooling comfort!</li>
            <li>I used Systane Gel Drops one day as a substitute for the Alrex and found immediate relief from the dry eyes, but the itching remained, so I used Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort after the Systane and found the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>Now me being a lower intelligent being, I wanted to experience myself as to why people feel that way, so I went to my local pharmacy and picked this product up since the price is identical to amazon (which is a very solid price).</li>
            <li>My first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They burn like heck for 35 seconds (I timed it) and then your eyes are red for another minute, but they do feel okay after that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product about 10 or more times in the last month.  </li>
            <li>soon as I put in the first drop, I was immediately hit with the cooling effect.</li>
            <li>I really did.  </li>
            <li>Worked for me, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really need that cooling to relief my eye itch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Opcon-A for a long time with great results, but I&#x27;m one of the small number of people for whom the Opcon-A drops make my eyes burn like the devil for about 20 seconds after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I tried a few more times over the course of 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I used that product and was good for only a few hours, so I started to supplement it with the Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort so that I could make it through the day.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t open them at first because of the minty-burn.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $ The product should be recalled, or warning labeled!</li>
            <li>Upon applying the first drops, I knew there was something different about them.</li>
            <li>And pointless if you ask me since it mostly just stings.  </li>
            <li>Only it wasn&#x27;t a positive thing.</li>
            <li>Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort works well for us..</li>
            <li>, I went on the Clear Eyes website for product information on their eye drops.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort still does the burning, but without the relief afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Clear Eyes Cooling during a series of allergy tests after I was verbally smacked by the doctor for using an antihistamine product pre-testing;</li>
            <li>Get the Clear Eyes Triple Action Relief.</li>
            <li>Complete 7 will whiten my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Get this if you&#x27;re not a morning person and need to wake early.</li>
            <li>I had bought and used other eye drops that give a nice sensation when used, and expected this product to do the same.</li>
            <li>No other drops or combination works for me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the reviews for Clear Eyes&#x27; Cooling Comfort eye drops have extremely different</li>
            <li>Only the Systane Gel drops followed by the Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort.  </li>
            <li>I must be odd, because I like that slight sting that hits my eyes before they start to cool.  </li>

            <li> I must be odd, because I like that slight sting that hits my eyes before they start to cool.  </li>
            <li> I also realized that I had far fewer issues with sensitivity once I stopped the other product.</li>
            <li> yes, the cooling effect the first couple of times did tend to bother me, because my eyes were not used to such a sensation but however after 4-5 use, my eyes adapted to the feeling and it really isn&#x27;t a negative aspect anymore.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this menthol inactive ingredient, while causing the burning sensation, may actually have a long term benefit for relieving itchy eyes.  </li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; they actually mean &amp;#34;feels like liquid hot magma poured in your eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot more expensive and come in smaller bottles, but only one drop lasts an entire day at work and they don&#x27;t make my eyes are crying out in pain.</li>
            <li> This does burn hard for about 3 seconds after use, but then pure heaven.  </li>
            <li> The other ingredients and inactive ingredients in both are the same.  </li>
            <li> The other eye did the same thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have dry eyes, but when I do, I can never seem to find my eye drops...</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe my eyes were just too dry</li>
            <li> , I never felt like I got any relief for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> The redness and fatigue in my eyes disappeared just after a single use of these drops.</li>
            <li> Just give the product a couple of tries, you will eventaully grow to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll guarantee you&#x27;ll be wide awake.</li>
            <li> With other drops the sensation went away within a few seconds, with this product my eyes continued to burn for the next 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers may be using one Cooling Comfort product and some the other which would explain the wide difference of opinions for this Cooling Comfort line.</li>
            <li> In other words, it burns.  </li>
            <li> Now like usual shoppers, I do vast amount of research before I purchase a product.</li>
            <li> Like all of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other drops I use don&#x27;t burn like that.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps stinging for a while afterward, as other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to open my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually put two drops in each eye and leave them closed for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It stings, but at least it only stings for a few seconds, and then my eyes stop itching!</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> needless to say, I was surprised that eye drops have that.  </li>
            <li> its a very odd sensation.</li>
            <li> hard to open eyes at first, its not like painful but like menthol in my eyes!</li>
            <li> And the only ones that do either blind you or burn.</li>
            <li> This product seems to get a lot of negative reviews, usually customers being negative towards the \\&quot;cooling effect\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews, but I was very disappointed with the Clear eyes cooling comfort drops.</li>
            <li> I had horrible eye trouble last year and ended up going to the Opthamologist who prescribed me Alrex (a steroid that costs about $140.00 for .025 FL OZ).</li>
            <li> my eyes still itch and now even worse.</li>
            <li> They will be worse off than before you used them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually write bad reviews...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crazy product.</li>
            <li> My eyes watered like crazy and stung.</li>
            <li> My eyes still itch like crazy AND burn AND feel menthol-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are outrageous in the stores.</li>
            <li> it is a horrible product</li>
            <li> Each time my eyes burn terribly after I put in the drops.  </li>
            <li> They are terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These BURN! And make you blind for many seconds. There is an istringent in them that acts like menthol. Get the Clear Eyes Triple Action Relief. No burn burn</li>
            <li> Love these eye drops and when I was recently able to grab 6 boxes of the 1 oz. Boxes for around $10 here on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. They are outrageous in the stores.</li>
            <li> I tried to like these drops.  I really did.  The idea of a soothing, cooling drop appealed to me. But what I realized is this &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect is from menthol.  And it works about as good as getting Vicks VapoRub on your fingers and sticking them in your eye.  In other words, it burns.  It stings. It makes my eyes feel like my eyeballs are swelling up.  I just can&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to go back to the Zaditor drops. They&#x27;re a lot more expensive and come in smaller bottles, but only one drop lasts an entire day at work and they don&#x27;t make my eyes are crying out in pain.</li>
            <li> ummmm... why is there \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; effects?? its like a menthol-y feeling... in my eyeballs! its a very odd sensation. hard to open eyes at first, its not like painful but like menthol in my eyes! sort of stops the itching...</li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; they actually mean &amp;#34;feels like liquid hot magma poured in your eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it is hard to open my eyes. does not work. dont waste your money. my eyes still itch and now even worse. it is a horrible product</li>
            <li> Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort works well for us..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crazy product. Worked for me, I really like it. But be prepared because it&#x27;s like taking Vapo-rub and smearing it in your eyes. You can&#x27;t open them at first because of the minty-burn. But I love it, lol. I love when eye-drops work. And the only ones that do either blind you or burn. (so A+)</li>
            <li> My first review on Amazon. The redness and fatigue in my eyes disappeared just after a single use of these drops. I do not wear glasses and have no vision problems. My symptoms were mild and it worked great.</li>
            <li> have tried many eye drops, best one every used, really made my eyes  feel great. would by again  and  again</li>
            <li> This does burn hard for about 3 seconds after use, but then pure heaven.  I have tried four different generic and visine products recently, this is the only one that has had real lasting relief.</li>
            <li> I bought and tried. It may not work for other people, but the best to me. The cooling feeling is a bit strong at the first try, but after times, I get so comfortable with it. I really need that cooling to relief my eye itch.</li>
            <li> I noticed the reviews for Clear Eyes&#x27; Cooling Comfort eye drops have extremely different opinions.&lt;br /&gt;So, I went on the Clear Eyes website for product information on their eye drops. They have TWO Cooling Comfort products, one for Itchy Eye Relief and one for Redness Relief.  I have the Cooling Comfort for Itchy Eye Relief and agree that it does have a lengthy burning sensation that goes away.  I found that this product lists .25% Zinc Sulfate as an Ingredient and menthol as an INACTIVE Ingredient.  The Cooling Comfort product for Redness Relief lists neither.  The other ingredients and inactive ingredients in both are the same.  Some reviewers may be using one Cooling Comfort product and some the other which would explain the wide difference of opinions for this Cooling Comfort line. I am wondering if this menthol inactive ingredient, while causing the burning sensation, may actually have a long term benefit for relieving itchy eyes.  I don&#x27;t like the burning sensation but, to be fair,  I&#x27;m giving it three stars while I try it longer.</li>
            <li> I am a student/huge gamer and that being said, sometimes I study or play video games for extensive amount of hours during the day. It puts a lot of pressure on my eyes which causes them to itch and sometimes I also experience some redness. Now like usual shoppers, I do vast amount of research before I purchase a product. This product seems to get a lot of negative reviews, usually customers being negative towards the \\&quot;cooling effect\\&quot;. Now me being a lower intelligent being, I wanted to experience myself as to why people feel that way, so I went to my local pharmacy and picked this product up since the price is identical to amazon (which is a very solid price). Now, after trying this product I must say, I do not agree with the majority of the reviewers. This product is actually very good and gets the job done. I usually put two drops in each eye and leave them closed for about 10 seconds. One thing I must say is yes, the cooling effect the first couple of times did tend to bother me, because my eyes were not used to such a sensation but however after 4-5 use, my eyes adapted to the feeling and it really isn&#x27;t a negative aspect anymore. Now that my eyes adapted to the drops, I really enjoy the cooling effect. Just give the product a couple of tries, you will eventaully grow to it. Overall great product, and great price.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews, but I was very disappointed with the Clear eyes cooling comfort drops. I had bought and used other eye drops that give a nice sensation when used, and expected this product to do the same. With other drops the sensation went away within a few seconds, with this product my eyes continued to burn for the next 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried using this product several times, but always get the same result. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Like all of the other reviews.  These eye drops will burn your eyes.  They will be worse off than before you used them.</li>
            <li> Burns the instant the drop touches your eye! Causes more burning and irritation than it relieves! It feels about like, what putting drops of bleach in your eyes might feel like. The only cooling feeling is when your tears have begun to wash the drops away from your eye and the pain is subsiding. Do not waste your $ The product should be recalled, or warning labeled!</li>
            <li> Purchased this produce a month ago. Upon applying the first drops, I knew there was something different about them. My eye stung and I couldn&#x27;t see for about 15 seconds until they recovered from the shock. The other eye did the same thing. The last time I had this feeling was when I had my eyes dilated by the eye doctor for tests. After the shock, they seem to work but I&#x27;m not going to be using them any more after 4 weeks. My eyes stung EACH time I used them. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing them more harm than good. I only have one set of eyes. Eye drops shouldn&#x27;t react this way.</li>
            <li> The title of my review says it.  They burn like heck for 35 seconds (I timed it) and then your eyes are red for another minute, but they do feel okay after that.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again because I&#x27;m not a pain-in-my-eye kind of person, but these are cheap and if you don&#x27;t mind stinging when you put drops in your eyes these could be for you.</li>
            <li> Complete 7 will whiten my eyes.  But I&#x27;m reluctant to keep using it.  I&#x27;ve used the product about 10 or more times in the last month.  Each time my eyes burn terribly after I put in the drops.  the pain stops after a couple of minutes. Other drops I use don&#x27;t burn like that.  I&#x27;m presently looking at reviews to see if there are some defective drops, or if others have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have dry eyes, but when I do, I can never seem to find my eye drops... so back to the store I go. I picked these out because I liked the idea of a cooling effect. I passed over the brand that my eye doctor recommends and even laughed that I fell for the marketing ploy of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put in the first drop, I was immediately hit with the cooling effect. Only it wasn&#x27;t a positive thing. Another reviewer nailed it. It feels like vicks vapor rub in your eye. Not good in my opinion. My eyes watered like crazy and stung. I thought that maybe my eyes were just too dry and that&#x27;s why it hurt, so I tried a few more times over the course of 24 hours. Not only did it feel the same each time, I never felt like I got any relief for my dry eyes. They felt raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely won&#x27;t buy these again. In fact, I may contact the manufacturer for a refund.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing a commercial.  I&#x27;ve been using Opcon-A for a long time with great results, but I&#x27;m one of the small number of people for whom the Opcon-A drops make my eyes burn like the devil for about 20 seconds after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort still does the burning, but without the relief afterwards.  Menthol cooling in the eyeballs is...strange.  And pointless if you ask me since it mostly just stings.  It also keeps stinging for a while afterward, as other reviewers have said.  But does it relieve eye itchiness from allergies?  Nope!  Not for me it doesn&#x27;t.  My eyes still itch like crazy AND burn AND feel menthol-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product works for some people but not others.  Not everyone responds to drugs the same way.  But I&#x27;ll stick with my Opcon-A.  It stings, but at least it only stings for a few seconds, and then my eyes stop itching!</li>
            <li> These eye drops burn! They are terrible! Would never recommend! Don&#x27;t usually write bad reviews... But trust me. Don&#x27;t. Get these!</li>
            <li> I must be odd, because I like that slight sting that hits my eyes before they start to cool.  I also like this product because it does not contain any antihistamine as most eye drops do.  I switched to Clear Eyes Cooling during a series of allergy tests after I was verbally smacked by the doctor for using an antihistamine product pre-testing; needless to say, I was surprised that eye drops have that.  I also realized that I had far fewer issues with sensitivity once I stopped the other product.</li>
            <li> I brought the one for Redeye and boy did it burn my eyes. Get this if you&#x27;re not a morning person and need to wake early. Apply 2 drops on each eye and I&#x27;ll guarantee you&#x27;ll be wide awake. or if you&#x27;re studying  an exam and falling asleep. do the same thing and apply on each eye. Hope it&#x27;ll help.</li>
            <li> I had horrible eye trouble last year and ended up going to the Opthamologist who prescribed me Alrex (a steroid that costs about $140.00 for .025 FL OZ). I used that product and was good for only a few hours, so I started to supplement it with the Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort so that I could make it through the day.  I used Systane Gel Drops one day as a substitute for the Alrex and found immediate relief from the dry eyes, but the itching remained, so I used Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort after the Systane and found the perfect solution.  No other drops or combination works for me.  Only the Systane Gel drops followed by the Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort.  I love this product!  It does sting right after you put it in, but then it truly provides cooling comfort!</li>
