            <li>It does great for brightening the eyes, covering blemishes and reverse lining the lips!</li>
            <li>And it is good also when cleaning the surroundings of a lip!</li>
            <li>This is a great pencil to prevent lipstick feathering.</li>
            <li>so no one knows why you look so alert, rested and great..</li>
            <li>THIS IS GREAT FOR THE WATER LINE OR FOR THE OUTLINER FOR YOUR LIPSTICK TO MAKE EM POP.</li>
            <li>i love this!!</li>
            <li>I love all NYX products but this concealer pencil is the best!!</li>
            <li>which is fair and olive</li>
            <li>does a fair job of helping to mask the shadows caused by wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t  impressed but use it as a waterline liner to brighten eyes!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this pencil!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and blends nicely as well.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Looks great when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Most of the product ends up on lower lash line.</li>
            <li>Very good concealer pencil, has more redish pigments than I expected, which is why I will apply it underneath my foundation.</li>
            <li>also have oily skin, so this product covers up very well, my eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
            <li>Might be okay to line the outside of your lips but not even that does a good job.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my eyebrows up</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, no mess!!</li>
            <li>Super waxy and no pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I so Love this better than the white pencil for the inner part of my eye, really makes my eyes look large and bright and</li>
            <li>Good price compared to alot of other brands I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>This came right on time.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly my skin tone,  </li>
            <li>but I would say it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour for me.</li>
            <li>So much better than white eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Fades fast.</li>
            <li>That will be the real test for me.</li>
            <li>After looking at much hyped reviews if the so called wonder pencil,i decided to get one.</li>
            <li>Its not of much use as a concealer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too pink for me, I have a more yellow undertone, but otherwise I think it would be fine for someone else with different color tones in their face.</li>
            <li>I like it better than some eyeliner pencils but do wish it would glide on a little easier.</li>
            <li>As an under eye brightener, it works very well and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>The Perfect shade of nude but doesnt apply on the eyes:(</li>
            <li>i wish i&#x27;d gotten the lighter one because it doesn&#x27;t light up my waterline like i expected, but it&#x27;s close enough to my skin color that i can use it was concealer for the red spots</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this NYX concealer pencil for my eyebrowsros and i haven&#x27;t had 1 complaint,  it&#x27;s exactly my skin tone,  which is fair and olive&lt;br /&gt;I also have oily skin, so this product covers up very well, my eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Not great. I have to use a lighter to soften the product, even then, the application is not effortless. Most of the product ends up on lower lash line. Fades fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great pencil to prevent lipstick feathering. I have not tried it with lip gloss. That will be the real test for me.</li>
            <li> I so Love this better than the white pencil for the inner part of my eye, really makes my eyes look large and bright and its skin color so no one knows why you look so alert, rested and great..</li>
            <li> Looks great when you first put it on but I would say it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour for me. I do have oily lids/waterline and typically like to use waterproof eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Just what i spect to recive.</li>
            <li> I did alot of research before purchasing this. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often but have started experimenting lately. Good price compared to alot of other brands I&#x27;ve seen. It goes on nice and blends nicely as well. I use it to clean my eyebrows up</li>
            <li> If it is attached to hide this pencil concealer at pinpoint so that it may set that it is equal, it will hide well! And it is good also when cleaning the surroundings of a lip!</li>
            <li> So much better than white eyeliner. Just makes eyes pop open after a long night or if you are just tired.</li>
            <li> The Perfect shade of nude but doesnt apply on the eyes:(</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t  impressed but use it as a waterline liner to brighten eyes!</li>
            <li> does a fair job of helping to mask the shadows caused by wrinkles.  don&#x27;t know if i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on your water line. Waste of money. Super waxy and no pigmentation. Might be okay to line the outside of your lips but not even that does a good job.</li>
            <li> After looking at much hyped reviews if the so called wonder pencil,i decided to get one. Its only purpose is for lining the water line of my eyes. Its not of much use as a concealer. I would not buy this next time.</li>
            <li> I saw this pencil at Ulta and I really liked it. I needed the medium shade but they were out on that. I didn&#x27;t wanted to wait  till my next visit, so I ordered here. The package came earlier than expected but it was in DARK shade. Now, what do i do with DARK shade when I needed the medium. I am soooooo very mad at the seller right now, he got my money all right but I am stuck with a product I neither need or want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pink for me, I have a more yellow undertone, but otherwise I think it would be fine for someone else with different color tones in their face.</li>
            <li> i love this!! i wish i&#x27;d gotten the lighter one because it doesn&#x27;t light up my waterline like i expected, but it&#x27;s close enough to my skin color that i can use it was concealer for the red spots</li>
            <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this pencil. It was too hard to use on the waterline. No color pay off at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this pencil! I have purchased it &amp;#62;3 times already! It does great for brightening the eyes, covering blemishes and reverse lining the lips! Great value for the price and lasts a long time. Will definitely continue purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love all NYX products but this concealer pencil is the best!! I use it to shape my eyebrows or use it just under the brow bone for a little highlight! I recommend this product to everyone!! It is very easy to use, no mess!!</li>
            <li> Very good concealer pencil, has more redish pigments than I expected, which is why I will apply it underneath my foundation. As an under eye brightener, it works very well and looks so natural. Definitely will be using this product daily.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR THE WATER LINE OR FOR THE OUTLINER FOR YOUR LIPSTICK TO MAKE EM POP. I WILL DEF ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This came right on time.  I like it better than some eyeliner pencils but do wish it would glide on a little easier.</li>
