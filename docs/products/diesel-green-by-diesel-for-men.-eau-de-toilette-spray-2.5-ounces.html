    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with amazon service.  </li>
            <li>a catastrophe of nonsense is the best way to describe it.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>But the cologne smells really great..</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>If Fuel for life and Plus Plus smell good on you then stay away from this.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in excellent condition (no leaking).  </li>
            <li>Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice, I am very happy whit tis product</li>
            <li>and I just kind of forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>nice sent but the sprayer broke after a couple months</li>
            <li>Really nice smell and nice presentation.</li>
            <li>reached the destination on time, in good condition, good quality product, durable and economical is the recommend!!!i love it !</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ideal (and others have commented positively on the scent when I wear it).</li>
            <li>Very synthetic scent, but still very good.  </li>
            <li>After 1 spray of this cologne, I knew it was nothing more than a decorative bottle of cologne that I would have for the rest of my life because I could not stand to wear it.</li>
            <li>ok ok</li>
            <li>I love diesel cologne.  </li>
            <li>Fuel for life and plus plus are on my top list.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>this is now one of my favorite scents from diesel.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic top and aweful sprayer make this more of a decorative piece in my collection then anything.  </li>
            <li>The sprayer level broke on mine, but still sprayed fine.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice light musky scent, its very masculine.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique, and you wont find anything else like it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because it looked cool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the cologne came about 60% full..</li>
            <li>so the bottle can come 100% full, heck, I&#x27;ll even take 95% full..</li>
            <li>But 60% full</li>
            <li>I bought because of the cool bottle and ended up liking it.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not like synthetic scents, but if you like any of the synthetic Lacoste scents you&#x27;ll be sure to like this one, moreso because of the price.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent to be pleasant - citrus, clean, and fresh, but not very strong.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks awesome but the spray nozzle is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li>The other day my wife said she wishes I could find it again because she loved the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li>This one does not smell right on me.  </li>
            <li>A bit of a let down as Diesel&#x27;s other colognes are unique, bold and delicious.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason this is marked down incredibly from its retail price.  </li>
            <li>Crisp, fresh, and has a bit of a citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>Good stuff... love the look of the bottle ... and the smell is very different from any other cologne that I have..</li>
            <li>I think they truly are on track to become the most customer centric company on the globe.</li>
            <li>I was wearing this the first time I meet my wife.  </li>
            <li>Well I decided to try Amazon first (as I do with everything)</li>
            <li>Good product, Diesel Green came well packed and arrived in time.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING and cannot beat the price anywhere else other than AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>There is a HUGE difference in product, as the two do not remotely resemble one another.</li>
            <li>I was dissapointed in the smell of the Red Cologne, it smelled too powdery and almost feminine, but I was happy that the Green Cologne smelled just right.  </li>
            <li>Certainly couldn&#x27;t give this as a gift -</li>
            <li>really?)</li>
            <li>It has a very woody smell and should be used sparingly.</li>
            <li>This is a lighter, fragrance and not at all heavy like some of the stuff that is popular.  </li>
            <li>To confirm another review on here, this isn&#x27;t the special edition as pictured, it&#x27;s the regular.    </li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s a classic...</li>
            <li>i highly recommend getting this cologne for anyone from ages 20-30.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I realized it was made of cheap plastic not the metal and glass I expected.</li>
            <li>I love this smell and it has become my signature scent--ironically, too, because my nickname is Green.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant, not too offensive manly smell...too bad</li>
            <li>Warning: This is not Diesel Green Special Edition, as is indicated by the photo!</li>
            <li>My son favorite - hard to find since it is no longer being produced</li>
            <li>and I was surprised it was still around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a masculine smell - woodsy and citric.  </li>
            <li>Picture is misleading for people looking for Diesel Green special edition, but that was not my case.</li>
            <li>I have read some of the more negative reviews about this cologne, and my experience has been very different.  </li>
            <li>I received my items in a very timely matter and it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li>If this is a limited or special edition, I should go ahead and buy a few more, because I will miss this one if it ever becomes extinct.</li>
            <li>Scent changes dramatically even a few minutes after application, doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>It is a very green(no-pun intended) synthetic mess.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Still giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not in any way a bad scent, just nothing amazing going on here.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time when sprayed on clothes.  </li>
            <li> diesel green: was shipped to me right away with very little wait at all, product leaked out and the company replaced with no problems at, i will use them again.</li>
            <li> a dry , man like smell ,</li>
            <li> On skin its a little different.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a pleasing green scent try lacoste essential or 212 for men.</li>
            <li> I filed a specific customer complaint and within less than half an hour I got a message from a customer service representative issuing me a refund.  </li>
            <li> The picture is incorrect, the product is Diesel Green, not Special Edition.  </li>
            <li> The Diesel Green scent was not to my liking.</li>
            <li> This is Diesel Green.</li>
            <li> Year round</li>
            <li> Its a candied green scent.  </li>
            <li> I need to get the colonge out and do not caare how ridiculous the sprayer is...</li>
            <li> its no good its faek not reall dont waest ur mone to by</li>
            <li> Very small projection cloud and weak longevity.  </li>
            <li> I have at least 2 bottles of this just in case I run out of one!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like any common, over-worn fragrance!</li>
            <li> i feel sorry for my solf</li>
            <li> I also find it difficult to apply the cologne..</li>
            <li> the packaging was dirty and the cologne melted the silver finish on the pump, making it smear off.  </li>
            <li> Oh well my bad.</li>
            <li> Scent is a either like it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> Probably the worst cologne purchases I have ever made.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently purchased this because the bottle caught my eye. After 1 spray of this cologne, I knew it was nothing more than a decorative bottle of cologne that I would have for the rest of my life because I could not stand to wear it.</li>
            <li> its no good its faek not reall dont waest ur mone to by it is ur chowes i by it bc its cheeb i feel sorry for my solf lol</li>
            <li> I have read some of the more negative reviews about this cologne, and my experience has been very different.  The picture is incorrect, the product is Diesel Green, not Special Edition.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition (no leaking).  I find the scent to be pleasant - citrus, clean, and fresh, but not very strong.  I would give this as a gift and purchase again in the future.  I like to have several scents on hand and for this price, it&#x27;s ideal (and others have commented positively on the scent when I wear it).</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it looked cool. When it arrived, I realized it was made of cheap plastic not the metal and glass I expected. Oh well my bad. The spray lever broke off a the hinges after three uses. The Diesel Green scent was not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant, not too offensive manly smell...too bad, they no longer make &#x27;em...now it&#x27;s a classic...</li>
            <li> Scent changes dramatically even a few minutes after application, doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  Probably the worst cologne purchases I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Amazon will not process a standard return for cologne(fire hazard?! really?) I filed a specific customer complaint and within less than half an hour I got a message from a customer service representative issuing me a refund.  I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with amazon service.  I think they truly are on track to become the most customer centric company on the globe.</li>
            <li> Warning: This is not Diesel Green Special Edition, as is indicated by the photo! This is Diesel Green. There is a HUGE difference in product, as the two do not remotely resemble one another. This photo needs to be changed in order to indicate the product being sold.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the cologne came about 60% full.. Like, what the fudge!? I pay money so the bottle can come 100% full, heck, I&#x27;ll even take 95% full.. But 60% full, that&#x27;s disrespect.. I also find it difficult to apply the cologne.. It has a grenade pin for pete&#x27;s sake.. But the cologne smells really great..</li>
            <li> Certainly couldn&#x27;t give this as a gift - the one I got had leaked a bit.  Not the end of the world but the packaging was dirty and the cologne melted the silver finish on the pump, making it smear off.  To confirm another review on here, this isn&#x27;t the special edition as pictured, it&#x27;s the regular.    As for the cologne itself, it&#x27;s mild, a little citrus-y, a little vanilla, a touch floral and very generic.  A bit of a let down as Diesel&#x27;s other colognes are unique, bold and delicious.

            <li> Good stuff... love the look of the bottle ... and the smell is very different from any other cologne that I have..&lt;br /&gt;its a dry , man like smell , Idk but I like it ... and the delivery was like 2days</li>
            <li> Good product, Diesel Green came well packed and arrived in time. Picture is misleading for people looking for Diesel Green special edition, but that was not my case.</li>
            <li> ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice, I am very happy whit tis product</li>
            <li> I love diesel cologne.  Fuel for life and plus plus are on my top list.  This one does not smell right on me.  I dont even like the smell of it on paper.  a catastrophe of nonsense is the best way to describe it. The bottle looks awesome but the spray nozzle is poorly designed.  it shoots out like a windex nozzle.  If Fuel for life and Plus Plus smell good on you then stay away from this.</li>
            <li> exelente servicio, recibido a tiempo y de buena calidad. todo perfecto. recomiendo ampliamente comprar de  este vendedor. . . .</li>
            <li> Very synthetic scent, but still very good.  Its not quite a summer scent, and not quite a winter scent.  Year round I guess.  Its a candied green scent.  I bought because of the cool bottle and ended up liking it.  I usually do not like synthetic scents, but if you like any of the synthetic Lacoste scents you&#x27;ll be sure to like this one, moreso because of the price.  Definitely for the younger crowd.  The sprayer level broke on mine, but still sprayed fine.  The scent is unique, and you wont find anything else like it.  Lasts a long time when sprayed on clothes.  On skin its a little different.</li>
            <li> I was wearing this the first time I meet my wife.  They stopped carrying it in stores it seems and I just kind of forgot about it.  The other day my wife said she wishes I could find it again because she loved the way it smelled.  This is a lighter, fragrance and not at all heavy like some of the stuff that is popular.  Well I decided to try Amazon first (as I do with everything) and I am glad I did.  Great price and I was surprised it was still around.</li>
            <li> this is now one of my favorite scents from diesel. i highly recommend getting this cologne for anyone from ages 20-30. it has a nice light musky scent, its very masculine. i never stop getting compliments from my friends</li>
            <li> I received my items in a very timely matter and it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and it has become my signature scent--ironically, too, because my nickname is Green. I have at least 2 bottles of this just in case I run out of one! Doesn&#x27;t smell like any common, over-worn fragrance! Crisp, fresh, and has a bit of a citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and cannot beat the price anywhere else other than AMAZON.  I purchased this and the Diesel Red Cologne to try.  I was dissapointed in the smell of the Red Cologne, it smelled too powdery and almost feminine, but I was happy that the Green Cologne smelled just right.  It&#x27;s a masculine smell - woodsy and citric.  Not too overpowering either.  If this is a limited or special edition, I should go ahead and buy a few more, because I will miss this one if it ever becomes extinct.</li>
            <li> nice sent but the sprayer broke after a couple months</li>
            <li> reached the destination on time, in good condition, good quality product, durable and economical is the recommend!!!i love it !</li>
            <li> I need to get the colonge out and do not caare how ridiculous the sprayer is...Looks like a handgrenade, works like sh..!</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it. Really nice smell and nice presentation.</li>
            <li> I never had this cologne before this recent purchase so I did not know what to expect. I like the fragrance but it is not for everyone. It has a very woody smell and should be used sparingly.</li>
