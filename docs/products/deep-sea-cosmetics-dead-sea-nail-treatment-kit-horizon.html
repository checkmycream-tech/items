            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to the one&#x27;s you find in the mall but way better price.</li>
            <li>My hands have NEVER looked and felt better.</li>
            <li>We both love the healthy, no-polish shine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered two kits.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and light then fades.</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>you would love this product, too).</li>
            <li>Today, I&#x27;m placing an order for 13 more of these...as a mother&#x27;s day gift and father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>I do plan on purchasing more</li>
            <li>I was walking through the mall just before Christmas 2012 and was approached by a beautiful young ethnic woman with a cute accent.</li>
            <li>My nails look great and a nice bonus, my hands feel and look younger.</li>
            <li>If you wear your nails natural and want to keep them looking great you can give this product a go, just buy it here and skip the mall.</li>
            <li>I went online and saw that they had this product available and at a lot better price.  </li>
            <li>The young woman was extremely confident and did a remarkable job at impressing me with the demonstration.</li>
            <li>oppened the package which looked fine, I found the nail files (two of them damaged/peeled)</li>
            <li>but he said it was a soft and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it does everything</li>
            <li>I was astonished that you could use this buffer for 20 seconds on a nail, using the 3 sides and get the fantastic results that you do.</li>
            <li>Bottom line:  fantastic product</li>
            <li>Now for the first time, they really look good - smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing, it makes your nail shine like you just put a clear polish on</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I would like to purchase some for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>He quickly offered the product to me for $25.</li>
            <li>I was lured in by a high pressure, but cute salesperson that made one of my nails shiney.</li>
            <li>My older son now wants his own bottle for himself.</li>
            <li>They ARE willing to bargain with you!</li>
            <li>My nails shine and my skin is soft and smooth with a light hint of fragrance after using the lotion.</li>
            <li>A very handsome young man convinced me to purchase the nail kit and a few more for my friends!  </li>
            <li>I could see that this was a good product, however I was not willing to pay the $50 price.</li>
            <li>Both my kids said they noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>ADS BEAUTY sent me two nail files right a way.</li>
            <li>Like so many, I was introduced to the Deep Sea Cosmetics products at a mall kiosk.  </li>
            <li>and it the shine lasts for the entire week or more.</li>
            <li>so I looked online and Amazon is such a better deal then the mall.</li>
            <li>As you can see I was able to find the exact item for a fourth of the price as what they were selling for in the mall.  </li>
            <li>My nails are smooth, super shiney and it only took seconds (I&#x27;m not kidding).</li>
            <li>As a small business owner I appreciate a good sales pitch.</li>
            <li>My natural nails look very pretty after using this.</li>
            <li>While at the mall, I spent $60 for two kits (buy one get one free) and thought it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>and this was so much easier</li>
            <li>She really put some pressure on me to buy kits for family and friends for Christmas, but I didn&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Deep Sea Cosmetics Nail Treatment kit.</li>
            <li>and I really didnt&#x27; care to pay that much money (up to $50) for some hand lotion and cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>I also got a full size of the dead sea salts for free.</li>
            <li>Glad to see that Amazon has this product for waaayyyy less money.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product mainly for myself as a nail treatment kit.</li>
            <li>My older son just tried it on his arms.</li>
            <li>Glad the little voice in my head didn&#x27;t give in to the sales lady at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to pamper myself much and I am too busy with my hands to bother with nail polish.</li>
            <li>A product that I don&#x27;t normally purchase for myself</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially if you&#x27;re like me and want pretty nails without using nail-polish.</li>
            <li>My husband did comment that he noticed a new smell when we went to bed</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Mine are so shiny, it looks and feels like I have clear nail-polish on.  </li>
            <li>use it to pamper my 88 year old mom, who can&#x27;t make it to the salon.  </li>
            <li>My younger son used it on his whole body after his bath.</li>
            <li>The product is excelent and the price is nowhere near what those from mall kiosk will try to pull from you.</li>
            <li>I was approached by a young lady at one of those kiosks at the mall.</li>
            <li>I see I could&#x27;ve gotten everything for probably half the cost right here on a website.</li>
            <li>I also used the buffer and cuticle oil on him and his hands are not only soft, but well groomed.  </li>
            <li>So needless to say I was not very happy, but as far as the product is concerned it does work to leave a great natural shine on your nails...</li>

            <li> Bought item for wife; Product by far is less than buying at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Like several other people, I was introduced to this product at our local Mall.  </li>
            <li> deep sea cosmetics nail treatment Kit was not what I had expected  </li>
            <li> The seller is reliable, honest reasonably priced and QUICK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had terrible fingernails and this product makes my nails so look so shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it at a local mall a few years back</li>
            <li> A single manicure costs $15 to $30</li>
            <li> I felt like kicking myself when I saw the same kit on Amazon for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> and I think with a little practice and the help of this nail treatment kit I can get similar results.</li>
            <li> I bought two (2) of Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea nail Kit from thru Amazon - merchant ADS BEAUTY.  </li>
            <li> He works in the yard a lot and the soil has caused his hands to be calloused and rough like sand paper.  </li>
            <li> Before buying anything at a kiosk at a mall, get the name of the product, then go home and see if you can get the same thing for a lot less!</li>
            <li> However, I have to echo the other reviews of this product and say that if you decide to buy it, buy through Amazon.      </li>
            <li> I purchased the kit for the and did my other 9 nails.</li>
            <li> The company that makes these products has a lot of negative reviews online not because of bad product, but because of pushy sales people and less than honest business practices.</li>
            <li> I bought the nail kit, along with the day and night creams and the black diamond mud mask.</li>
            <li> I heard and saw this product on TV and in the malls and thought that it was not worth the money for a square little spong looking item</li>
            <li> Today Saturday 11/12/11, a little package surprise was in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> In a few minutes, I received an e-mail that will not be a problem...</li>
            <li> Then washed my hands with some exfoliating Dead Sea salt scrub and massaged in some lotion.</li>
            <li> Now usually I run from these people</li>
            <li> Love this, but I just bought it from a insanely pushy sales woman at the mall.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly shoddy looking nails.  </li>
            <li> I seriously could not stop looking at my nails after using this product.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got rooked into buying this at the mall and paid a small fortune.  </li>
            <li> But boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> but it was so expensive that I did not want to purchase it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bartered for this product at the mall and ended up paying $25.  I have always had fairly shoddy looking nails.  Now for the first time, they really look good - smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought the nail kit from a kiosk at the mall. The gorgeous salesman (from Israel) was very good at persuading me to buy this product but even at $63.00 my nails look great. I will very likely buy this again just not at the mall. I also got a full size of the dead sea salts for free.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I purchased it at a local mall a few years back and i feel in love! The lotion smells delightful and the nail product is very easy and useful for my nails. Overall a wonderful product that i recommend to everyone! And the price is great.</li>

            <li> I bought this kit at a kiosk at my local mall. My hands have NEVER looked and felt better. I am now a fan. One word of advice... Don&#x27;t automatically pay the price that is quoted by the salesperson. They ARE willing to bargain with you!</li>
            <li> Like so many, I was introduced to the Deep Sea Cosmetics products at a mall kiosk.  A very handsome young man convinced me to purchase the nail kit and a few more for my friends!  Fortunately, it does everything claimed.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to pamper my 88 year old mom, who can&#x27;t make it to the salon.  We both love the healthy, no-polish shine.  Thank goodness Amazon has this product at a great value.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail kit at a mall after a demonstration by a sales rep.  The products work great.  My nails shine and my skin is soft and smooth with a light hint of fragrance after using the lotion. However, I have to echo the other reviews of this product and say that if you decide to buy it, buy through Amazon.      While at the mall, I spent $60 for two kits (buy one get one free) and thought it was worth it.  I felt like kicking myself when I saw the same kit on Amazon for a lot less.  The company that makes these products has a lot of negative reviews online not because of bad product, but because of pushy sales people and less than honest business practices. If you wear your nails natural and want to keep them looking great you can give this product a go, just buy it here and skip the mall.</li>
            <li> A product that I don&#x27;t normally purchase for myself, I found this was a nice treat for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product mainly for myself as a nail treatment kit. Then I read the box and it mentioned that it was good for skin conditions. My kids have eczema and I thought why not give it a try?? Both my kids said they noticed a difference right away. My younger son used it on his whole body after his bath. My older son just tried it on his arms. The next day I asked if they noticed a difference. Both of them said that they did. My older son now wants his own bottle for himself. I&#x27;m glad I ordered two kits. The fragrance is nice and light then fades. Which is perfect for the boys. My husband did comment that he noticed a new smell when we went to bed but he said it was a soft and pleasant smell. As for the nail kit part, it works too. My nails look great and a nice bonus, my hands feel and look younger. I may just put this on my gift list for others. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am not one to pamper myself much and I am too busy with my hands to bother with nail polish. I was approched by a lady that worked at a Deep Sea Cosmetics Kiosk in the mall. Now usually I run from these people but I went ahead and let her use this buffer on one of my nails and I have to say that my jaw dropped! I was astonished that you could use this buffer for 20 seconds on a nail, using the 3 sides and get the fantastic results that you do. Absolutely amazing, it makes your nail shine like you just put a clear polish on and it the shine lasts for the entire week or more. I dont have time to pamper myself but I can do this while sitting in traffic. I seriously could not stop looking at my nails after using this product. After showing another busy mom at work, she was so impressed that I decided she also needed to get this product so I looked online and Amazon is such a better deal then the mall. I got my co-worker one for Christmas and we love it. The lotion and cuticle oil are an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Bought item for wife; Product by far is less than buying at the mall.  Great product if you like shiny nails.</li>
            <li> hopefully you will have read this before you buy it at any mall kiosk.  I had just bought this kit at the mall for $50!!!!!  So needless to say I was not very happy, but as far as the product is concerned it does work to leave a great natural shine on your nails...</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product as I had purchased them before at a mall and this was so much easier</li>
            <li> Deep Sea works just like they say.  I was approached by a sales lady at the mall &amp; she demo the product.  She really put some pressure on me to buy kits for family and friends for Christmas, but I didn&#x27;t buy.  I really liked how the product made my nails look, so when I got home I decided to see if I could buy the product cheaper on the net.  As you can see I was able to find the exact item for a fourth of the price as what they were selling for in the mall.  Glad the little voice in my head didn&#x27;t give in to the sales lady at the mall.  Product is very good, but don&#x27;t buy from those booths set up in the malls.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Deep Sea Cosmetics Nail Treatment kit. It works like magics and already recommended it to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I heard and saw this product on TV and in the malls and thought that it was not worth the money for a square little spong looking item and I really didnt&#x27; care to pay that much money (up to $50) for some hand lotion and cuticle oil. But boy, was I wrong. My girlfriend just bought this product from the mall stand for her mother for mother&#x27;s day and showed me how it works. I loved loved loved it!! My nails are smooth, super shiney and it only took seconds (I&#x27;m not kidding). My fiance asked that I try that on him and now he asked me to order this product for his mom and sisters in addition to one for him (yes, gents...you would love this product, too). Today, I&#x27;m placing an order for 13 more of these...as a mother&#x27;s day gift and father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> I bought two (2) of Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea nail Kit from thru Amazon - merchant ADS BEAUTY.  WOW! I am very impressed how fast the product was delivered. When ordered from Amazon, I contacted ADS BEAUTY thru e-mai if they can send me One horizon and one coral. In a few minutes, I received an e-mail that will not be a problem...THEY DID SEND ME WHAT I ASKED.When oppened the package which looked fine, I found the nail files (two of them damaged/peeled) I let them know and again...WOW! Today Saturday 11/12/11, a little package surprise was in my mailbox. ADS BEAUTY sent me two nail files right a way. The product is excelent and the price is nowhere near what those from mall kiosk will try to pull from you. Overall...EXCELENT PRODUCT, EXCELENT MERCHANT ...I am so happy...my nails and my husband nails are shiny and when using the cream, smell heavenly. Thank you Amazon that you work with merchant so reliable, honest like ADS BEAUTY.</li>
            <li> When I was in Nashville I had the opportunity to try this product in the mall but it was so expensive that I did not want to purchase it.  I went online and saw that they had this product available and at a lot better price.  So I purchased this for me and I was very happy with it.  It worked just like the product that I had used at the mall in Nashville.  Great product for your hads and nails</li>
            <li> I just have plane jane nails no matter what.  The only way my nail will grow is if I have an overlay.  I have my nail lady do this for me.</li>
            <li> I was also introduced to this product at the mall. I was lured in by a high pressure, but cute salesperson that made one of my nails shiney. I could see that this was a good product, however I was not willing to pay the $50 price. He quickly offered the product to me for $25. I purchased the kit for the and did my other 9 nails. My natural nails look very pretty after using this. I love this product so much, I would like to purchase some for Christmas gifts. Bottom line:  fantastic product, just make sure you get a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male. I was walking through the mall just before Christmas 2012 and was approached by a beautiful young ethnic woman with a cute accent. As a small business owner I appreciate a good sales pitch. The young woman was extremely confident and did a remarkable job at impressing me with the demonstration. My nails are a travesty and I&#x27;ve considered a manicure but have never gotten up the nerve. She buffed out one of my finger nails and I was impressed with the shine, it looked like it had polish on it. She then used some cuticle remover. Then washed my hands with some exfoliating Dead Sea salt scrub and massaged in some lotion. I felt the product was overpriced at $50 but the young woman&#x27;s selling skills impressed me. She was a master of selling and I admire that. I also wanted to support another entrepreneur. When considering her overhead such as kiosk space rental, credit card processor, and hourly wage I felt $50 was acceptable. A single manicure costs $15 to $30 and I think with a little practice and the help of this nail treatment kit I can get similar results.</li>
            <li> Like several other people, I was introduced to this product at our local Mall.  Since I couldn&#x27;t afford the price they were asking, I looked for it on line.  The seller is reliable, honest reasonably priced and QUICK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had terrible fingernails and this product makes my nails so look so shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband tried the lotion for his hands and the result is amazing.  He works in the yard a lot and the soil has caused his hands to be calloused and rough like sand paper.  I also used the buffer and cuticle oil on him and his hands are not only soft, but well groomed.  Great product for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this, but I just bought it from a insanely pushy sales woman at the mall. Ridiculous, but I was sold ASAP. I do plan on purchasing more but I feel totally cheated on the cost (60$) from the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I was approached by a young lady at one of those kiosks at the mall. We started with the hand lotion, and ended up with the facial lift. I thought the product was amazing.I bought the nail kit, along with the day and night creams and the black diamond mud mask. Cost me quite a bit! I see I could&#x27;ve gotten everything for probably half the cost right here on a website. Lesson learned. Before buying anything at a kiosk at a mall, get the name of the product, then go home and see if you can get the same thing for a lot less!</li>
            <li> deep sea cosmetics nail treatment Kit was not what I had expected  the lotion was good but I would not reorder</li>
            <li> Have used these kits for years. As a massage therapist, my hands are a show of my work so need to keep them looking their best and this always does the job. Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is I only need the buffer and there are cheaper ones on this site.</li>
