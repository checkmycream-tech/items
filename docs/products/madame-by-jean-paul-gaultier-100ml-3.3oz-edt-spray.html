            <li> This perfume is wonderful! It smells great and the smell actually lasts! It was deal and i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I paid 45$ and got 100ml (3.3oz) in return - within a week, without any problems.  I just love this parfum, I&#x27;m actually from Germany where it costs 90 Euro (!), so this was a super good deal!  The parfum just smells really good and lasts for a really long time; I&#x27;m really satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> excellent purchase, I arrived at the agreed time and that I live outside the U.S., plus the package COMES IN A BOX PROTECTED FOR SHELTER, sending NOTHING EXPENSIVE arrived in excellent condition veery good store,</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfumes and I recommend buying if you like a nice soft, sweet smell that lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not original. The fragrance don&#x27;t be wit you. Sat 2 hours you can feel anithing. Not recommended this product</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle, but honestly, this is the worst perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  My son purchased LeMan, and it was delicious!!  I would have rather purchased it than this!  I kept thinking my smeller was off, but no matter when I took a whiff, It was gawd awful!  Sorry, but I&#x27;m done with Jean Paul!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for a number of years and to get it for the price I get it through Amazon is a bonus</li>
            <li> Two fingers&#x27; length was lost during shipping even though they had the lock on it. Unfortunately I could not ask for exchange since this was a gift to my very good friend, who lives in Brazil, so I had to apologize to her and sends it anyways.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I didn&#x27;t see the fine print about it really being 1.6 oz. They must have fixed the misprint if there was one. I saw this fragrance at Ulta and it was so expensive. I looked here and thought $45 for 3.3 is a risk I&#x27;d take. I&#x27;m glad I did! It comes full sized like it says. The cap was a little dented in the travel but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It works great and smells wonderful, a total deal if you ask me. Order it!</li>
            <li> I received Madame by Rochas, not Madame by Jean Paul Gaultier. Was it a mistake or was it intentional? I will never know.&lt;br /&gt;As a perfume is classified as hazardous materials, you cannot return it for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was refunded by Amazon so at least I didn&#x27;t lose money but I am still looking for my Jean Paul Gautier perfume!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!  Everyone stops me to ask me what perfume I have on.  It stays on you all day.</li>
            <li> An excellent perfume! The shipping condition was perfect! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase</li>
