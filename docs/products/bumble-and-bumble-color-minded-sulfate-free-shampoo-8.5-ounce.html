            <li>Bumble and Bumble makes the best, color safe, sulfate free shampoo that I have tried so far (compare to John Freida Radiant Red, Pureology Hydrate, and Suave Professionals Color Care products).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve switched to the l&#x27;oreal brand for color and like it so much better, and its so much cheaper!</li>

            <li>Although your hair color will eventually fade, the dye added to your hair will not fade as quickly while using these products.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> High price, but very good quality</li>
            <li> I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for 20 shampoos.  If you are a red head or have colored red hair this product doesn&#x27;t hold up to its claims.  After 20 not 40 shampoos the color has faded just like my reg. shampoos suggested for colored hair. It smells great but way too pricey for what you get.  Their claims are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Color Minded Shampoo and Conditioner for two years.  My hairstylist recommended these products to me after she put coloring in my hair to make it a darker, uniform color.  The shampoo is white, and it comes in a clear bottle that contains 8.5 fluid ounces of hair product.  The conditioner is also white, and it comes in a clear tube that contains 5 fluid ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are both designed to prevent hair color from quickly fading away.  The shampoo&#x27;s strength is mild and it does not contain sulfate.  The conditioner is also designed to keep hair tones the same.  After using the shampoo, leave the conditioner in for a couple minutes before rinsing it out with water.  Although your hair color will eventually fade, the dye added to your hair will not fade as quickly while using these products.&lt;br /&gt;The Bumble and Bumble Color Minded Shampoo and Conditioner have several positive qualities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shampoo keeps hair color looking fresh and vibrant for a longer duration than regular shampoos.  Although the shampoo is more expensive than other brands, it will prevent you from spending extra time and money in the hair salons to freshen up your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shampoo will prevent hair from getting greasy, while still making hair appear shiny and radiant.  Additionally, the shampoo smells clean, so it will leave your hair smelling fresh all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The conditioner is very smooth and soft, and it does not leave residue in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Bumble and Bumble has great hair care products, this particular shampoo and conditioner still has room for improvement. One criticism I have is that the shampoo does not lather well.  Because of this, it is difficult to spread the shampoo throughout your entire head of hair. The shampoo pretty much remains exactly where it is applied.  If you have long hair, you will have to use more than the suggested use to spread the product throughout your hair, which will cause you to go through the product very quickly.  Since Bumble and Bumble shampoos are costly and come in small bottles, expenses can add up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I started noticing once I started using this product was that my hair became much more difficult to brush and comb through. My hair is naturally smooth, so I had never had that problem before.  It might be a wise idea to buy a detangling product to make brushing through your hair easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who gets his or her hair dyed at a hair salon or puts color in his or her own hair.

            <li> I color my hair-so I was glad to find a sulfate free product for colored hair. I love it-smells great, leaves no residue! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Makes my hair feel silky and soft. It smells great too. I was looking for a more natural shampoo and conditioner for my colored hair and ended up being very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it really does preserve your color!! Well worth the price...if you have shoulder length or shorter hair, use this sparingly. It can give your hair a greasy look if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Use the Bumble &amp; Bumble for my colored hair for years &amp; it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> I really dislike this shampoo.  It does not create a good lather so my hair does not feel clean -- it also leaves areas of my hair greasy (leaves behind some kind of buildup).  Gross!</li>
            <li> I ordered nude color you sent me white. Fits great under illusion back cocktail dress</li>
            <li> Love the product.. I only buy from Amazon for Tide.. Thank you; Keep it coming. A very satisfied customer from years of service.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Works well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do not like the color shampoo at all.  It makes my hair feel like sandpaper.  I was very disappointed when I started using it because I love the volumizing shampoo and thought this one would be great too.  It was extremely expensive and I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this on me a the salon and it smells wonderful.  With regular use over a month or so my hair is noticeably stronger and softer.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo, fast delivery, thank you</li>
            <li> I was using Kerastase for months, but switched to this product to give my hair more variety.  I have a pixie cut and need to get my hair done every 6wks but this product keeps my blonde lowlights vibrant between appointments.  Highly recommended and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is another shampoo for color treated hair that I really like. I try to alternate shampoos and since I color my hair, I look for products that are made for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises. Leaves my hair shinier, smoother. My hair has never felt or looked as clean for days between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble BUT I have to admit that I am not impressed. I have not noticed any significant improvement in my color lasting or fading any better. I will stick to my the Creme de Coco line.I do wish Bumble and Bumble would take this &amp;#34;color minded&amp;#34; idea just a step further and offer tinted shampoos...hint hint Bumble and Bumble:)</li>
            <li> Incredible shampoo!!  Perfect for someone who needs &amp;#34;just a touch&amp;#34; of conditioning in their shampoo...won&#x27;t weight down your hair!  I use the companion conditioner with the shampoo every-other-day to make my hair so soft and manageable!  It&#x27;s the only brand that has worked well for me...most shampoos either leave my hair too dry or too flat.  Bumble and Bumble is such a great find!</li>
            <li> It not only keeps color well (I have red hair) but it also smells GREAT!  Also, not to heavy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Bumble and bumble Color Minded shampoo, conditioner, and styling balm as a free sample.  I used all three per the product instructions.  My hair is thick, but fine textured. It is also highlighted and prone to tangling and dryness.  I did not like this shampoo because it did not lather and my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product for his hair.  It does not appear to be harsh, and has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. My hair prefers Rene Furturer (leaves it shinier), so I switch back &amp; forth. Everybody&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s highly recommended at the Salon I go to.</li>
            <li> i have tried multiple bumble and bumble products and really loved them. therefore, when my  stylists at a bumble and bumble salon told me to try color minded i jumped at the chance. the shampoo has been fine, nothing great about it but fine. the conditioner is honestly awful. it makes my hair smell BURNT (as if i just ran it over a fire) after each wash. Even my family can smell it from a far distance when I get out of the shower. and the burnt smell doesn&#x27;t fade! it is absolutely disgusting. i&#x27;ve switched to the l&#x27;oreal brand for color and like it so much better, and its so much cheaper! color minded conditioner is awful, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Great Sulfa Free shampoo for my itchy scalp and blonde hair!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that I dye red and so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the color very long. Bumble and Bumble makes the best, color safe, sulfate free shampoo that I have tried so far (compare to John Freida Radiant Red, Pureology Hydrate, and Suave Professionals Color Care products). When used properly, the product extends the life of my hair color. To get the best results from the product, I only wash my hair every other day and I only use roughly a quarter-sized amount of shampoo to keep my hair from getting too greasy. On the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I use Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry shampoo which is comparable to the Bumble and Bumble dry shampoo.</li>
