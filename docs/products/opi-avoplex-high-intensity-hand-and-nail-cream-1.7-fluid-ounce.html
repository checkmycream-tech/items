            <li>It has a lovely smell and is quite hydrating.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li>Getting it from Amazon is a much better deal, too.</li>
            <li>will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works best if you remember to put it on daily</li>
            <li>My nails and cuticles are in much better condition than before I used this product.</li>
            <li>I do love OPI products.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>OPI Avoplex High-Intensity Hand and Nail Cream is the perfect solution to my dry and cracked hands and nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I received one as a gift and loved it, absorbs well, leaves hands nice and soft</li>
            <li>This was even more important to me than the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and has a refreshing scent of citrus and peach, not overpowering or overly girly.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hands smooth and my nails strong.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think there could be much difference, but it&#x27;s definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li>Smell is very light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Turned out to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>It has a light citrus lemon smell to it.</li>
            <li>makes my hands so smooth</li>
            <li>It lubricated and relaxed the skin on my hands making them moist and smooth without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>This fits the bill on that count and also keeps my hands and cuticles smooth.  </li>
            <li>Rich, creamy.</li>
            <li>Water worn hands have become smoother and less wrinkled and pleasantly touchable!  </li>
            <li>Great if you have dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s TRUE.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients that stood out to me were Shea Butter, Keratin, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Fruit Oil and Kelp Extract.</li>
            <li>I have tried other hand creams and for the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to feel my skin felt more hydrated and flexible.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the reviews for the \\&quot;O-P-I\\&quot; hand cream were overall very good and decided to try it, especially when I read it</li>
            <li>Another reviewer had mentioned how it absorbed and was greaseless, no aftermath feeling.  </li>
            <li>The same high quality cream sold in the trendy salon in our neighborhood but at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li>The size is just right to carry in your bag</li>
            <li>Love this product thank you, my hands are not dry anymore</li>
            <li>I definitely intend to purchase again and again and also intend to recommend to my friends who I&#x27;m sure will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>it absorbed fast .I</li>
            <li>less than 1/2 a dime&#x27;s worth is more than adequate for the hands.    </li>
            <li>I ordered a large tube so it will last longer :)</li>
            <li>I really like and trust \\&quot;Nails and Beyond\\&quot; and am very very picky</li>
            <li>reading all the positive reviews I went ahead and placed the order I purchased two one for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li>I like it made my hands nice and soft and nails smooth and hard</li>
            <li>This cream really makes a difference and the difference lasts</li>
            <li>Really Help my wife&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>i like it so much .</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH .</li>
            <li>So how can I complain much?</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Fragrance does not last long at all, I consider that a PLUS (the scent is nice</li>
            <li>Dry, peeling cuticles are retaining more of their natural moisture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super thick and rich like some, but it is very nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The BIGGEST surprise was when I used what I thought was a &#x27;&#x27;NORMAL&#x27;&#x27; APPLICATION OF CREAM.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice subtle sheen to my skin and nails and has done wonders to my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is super dry, but i need to apply it every hour to keep them conditioned.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances yet</li>
            <li>Finally a hand cream that really works .After</li>
            <li>but fires not go far.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>It works really well add long as you remember to apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days so far</li>
            <li>had only a light fragrance and only a very small amount</li>
            <li>got this lotion in hopes that my hands can finally feel normal and not catch onto finer fabrics because of how rough it is.</li>
            <li>This stuff moisturizes quickly without being greasy or leaving a heavy lotion feeling like other hand creams.</li>

            <li> It works really well add long as you remember to apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days so far</li>
            <li> had only a light fragrance and only a very small amount</li>
            <li> got this lotion in hopes that my hands can finally feel normal and not catch onto finer fabrics because of how rough it is.</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizes quickly without being greasy or leaving a heavy lotion feeling like other hand creams.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual Murad Youth Builder hand cream and wanted to try something new since the Murad hand cream wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough for me.</li>
            <li> I will buy this as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> he is an Electrician and his hands are always dry and cracked this lotion solved his problem</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;really helps my dry nails &amp;cuticles</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do for your dry hands and scraggly nails.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediate results the dry rough spots went away</li>
            <li> and you only need to use a little bit at a time, not oily at all</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way so it definitely gets my vote!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but it works!</li>
            <li> However, the smell isn&#x27;t as obnoxious as some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> wish I could find a larger size bottle then the small .</li>
            <li> But other than that: it works.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have trouble with dry and cracked hands during the winter.  </li>
            <li> the reviewer who stated only a small amount is necessary means A VERY SMALL AMOUNT, I would say</li>
            <li> My only complaint with my purchase, is it&#x27;s shown in a box.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to any fragrance (which I am not typically) you will hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I also have a mild case of eczema, add that onto the dry winter wind and my hands are always in terrible condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would spend the money on this product again.</li>
            <li> BUT, I just  cannot get past the SMELL!</li>
            <li> Too bad it does not come in a larger size so that I can keep it on my dressing table.</li>
            <li> I really believe if you try this product you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I feel this has definitely decreased that within 3 days of use.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it gets so bad that I wear gloves in the summer to protect other people from my hands ..&lt;</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my nasty cuticles and dry nails as well.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but it works!</li>
            <li> I decided to use nail polish again and long-story-short discovered \\&quot;Nails and Beyond\\&quot; the seller for the OPI products I have purchased.  I noticed the reviews for the \\&quot;O-P-I\\&quot; hand cream were overall very good and decided to try it, especially when I read it had only a light fragrance and only a very small amount was necessary to application.  Turned out to be accurate.  I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances yet my hands needed alot of help in the skin area.  Fragrance does not last long at all, I consider that a PLUS (the scent is nice, I just don&#x27;t do well with fragrances, that&#x27;s all).  The BIGGEST surprise was when I used what I thought was a &#x27;&#x27;NORMAL&#x27;&#x27; APPLICATION OF CREAM.  LOL  I ended-up having to rub the dime-size amount on both hands and forearms to finally utilize all of it, so the reviewer who stated only a small amount is necessary means A VERY SMALL AMOUNT, I would say less than 1/2 a dime&#x27;s worth is more than adequate for the hands.    So, considering &#x27;&#x27;cost-per-use&#x27;&#x27;, the price is very, very good for usage level obtainable.  OH ALMOST FORGOT:  the reason I won&#x27;t use and had literally given-up on o-t-c hand creams was no matter what they said on the label, I could not find a brand that did NOT leave a &#x27;&#x27;residue&#x27;&#x27; sensation/feeling on the hands.  This was even more important to me than the fragrance.  Another reviewer had mentioned how it absorbed and was greaseless, no aftermath feeling.  It&#x27;s TRUE.  I really like and trust \\&quot;Nails and Beyond\\&quot; and am very very picky actually so am happy to find a good product line thru a seller I trust completely.</li>
            <li> The texture and smell are just great. The size is just right to carry in your bag and of course the price is really very low I would say for the value that you get</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this hand cream did anything to my hands and it takes a while to absorb. It actually pales in comparison to my cheaper hand lotions I bought from the drug store. However, the smell isn&#x27;t as obnoxious as some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> OPI&#x27;s Avoplex High Intensity Hand &amp; Nail cream is wonderful.  I use it every night and find it has softened my cuticles and keeps my hands moisturized.  I especially love the scent, it&#x27;s like aromatherapy, very light and rejuvenating.  Didn&#x27;t think there could be much difference, but it&#x27;s definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> Have to keep reapplying it to make a difference</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Lightweight, sinks in quickly.  Seems to be helping my nasty cuticles and dry nails as well.  The downside?  My dog loves to eat it.  Gotta find a better hiding place.</li>
            <li> Liked the product. Rich, creamy. Works well. BUT, I just  cannot get past the SMELL! UGH P.U. If you are at all sensitive to any fragrance (which I am not typically) you will hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Great if you have dry, cracked hands. Some of my RN friends introduced me to this stuff, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this hand &amp; nail cream! I love OPI nail polish so I was stoked to find they had a hand cream. I ran out of my usual Murad Youth Builder hand cream and wanted to try something new since the Murad hand cream wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough for me. I have an issue with my nails cracking or the back of my hands being itchy from dryness. I feel this has definitely decreased that within 3 days of use. The ingredients that stood out to me were Shea Butter, Keratin, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Fruit Oil and Kelp Extract. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this hand cream, especially for the price and size (1.7 fluid ounces) it can&#x27;t be beat! Also, the smell is amazing...I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hands. It has a light citrus lemon smell to it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion.  I was given a tube of this and just had to have more.  I am so grateful for this product.  The smell, the texture, the non greasy feel of this is amazing.  I will definetly be ordering more and more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my lotion for life!</li>
            <li> The same high quality cream sold in the trendy salon in our neighborhood but at a fabulous price. Sellers are great people to deal with and would not hesitate to do business with them again (which I plan on!).</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have trouble with dry and cracked hands during the winter.  This cream is the BEST we have found!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream by OPI! The fragrance is light and has a refreshing scent of citrus and peach, not overpowering or overly girly. My husband even likes to use this every once and awhile as its a great moisturizer. This stuff moisturizes quickly without being greasy or leaving a heavy lotion feeling like other hand creams. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff. It also leaves a nice subtle sheen to my skin and nails and has done wonders to my cuticles. I have tried other hand creams and for the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> makes my hands so smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  LOVE it.  Keeps my hands smooth and my nails strong.  Also good price...</li>
            <li> This cream has a wonderful scent, and easy to apply.  Have yet to see if it helps my frail fingernails, though.</li>
            <li> OPI Avoplex High-Intensity Hand and Nail Cream is the perfect solution to my dry and cracked hands and nails. I love the smell and I love the texture. I definitely intend to purchase again and again and also intend to recommend to my friends who I&#x27;m sure will purchase again and again. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> It is good quality hand cream, feels nice on the skin and smells great. Maybe my skin is super dry, but i need to apply it every hour to keep them conditioned.</li>
            <li> My hands stays in water as a florist so I was looking for a good hand and nail lotion to use .This I like it made my hands nice and soft and nails smooth and hard it absorbed fast .I wish I could find a larger size bottle then the small . This product I like .</li>
            <li> Finally a hand cream that really works .After reading all the positive reviews I went ahead and placed the order I purchased two one for my daughter and myself.I noticed immediate results the dry rough spots went away and my hands have never looked and felt so good the problem is my husband used it for his hands he is an Electrician and his hands are always dry and cracked this lotion solved his problem so I have to order more ASAP! As for my daughter she said its a five star hand lotion and would order again I really believe if you try this product you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This cream really makes a difference and the difference lasts</li>
            <li> I like the smell and quality of the cream.  Smell is very light and fresh.  I ordered a large tube so it will last longer :)</li>
            <li> Really Help my wife&#x27;s nails.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> i like it so much . I think I would recommend it to my friends. Let the hand become more flexible.</li>
            <li> Love this hand lotion.  My only complaint with my purchase, is it&#x27;s shown in a box.  I ordered 5 tubes, but none of them were in a box.  I had planned on giving as gifts, so I guess they will become Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I keep this on my bedside table so I don&#x27;t forget to use it before I turn in.</li>
            <li> It works really well add long as you remember to apply it. I wish it was a bigger tube especially for the price. I use it in conjunction with the Cuticle Oil To Go by Avoplex. All in all I&#x27;m not sure if I would spend the money on this product again. It does work well but fires not go far.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I am happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Day 1:  Rubbed the cream all over my hands I was very surprised to feel my skin felt more hydrated and flexible.  It lubricated and relaxed the skin on my hands making them moist and smooth without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2:  Dry, peeling cuticles are retaining more of their natural moisture&lt;br /&gt;Day 3:  The skin on the sides of the nail bed softened and is more supple; cuticle peeling has noticeably diminished&lt;br /&gt;Day 4:  Water worn hands have become smoother and less wrinkled and pleasantly touchable!  Very little goes a long way so it definitely gets my vote!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I received one as a gift and loved it, absorbs well, leaves hands nice and soft</li>
            <li> Amazing ! Amazing nail cream !!!! Wonderful seller . THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hand cream I have ever used. Goes on creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Will definately buy more.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a hand and nail cream that I can carry around in my purse.  This fits the bill on that count and also keeps my hands and cuticles smooth.  Too bad it does not come in a larger size so that I can keep it on my dressing table.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hand creams. It has a lovely smell and is quite hydrating. It&#x27;s not super thick and rich like some, but it is very nice. I prefer it for warmer times of year when the air isn&#x27;t quite so drying. The scent is lovely too. I will buy this as long as they keep making it! Getting it from Amazon is a much better deal, too.</li>
            <li> will be buying more.  I knew the polish was great and so it this&lt;br /&gt;Works best if you remember to put it on daily&lt;br /&gt;really helps my dry nails &amp;cuticles</li>
            <li> But other than that: it works. It does what it says it will do for your dry hands and scraggly nails. So how can I complain much? One star off for scent...</li>
            <li> Works well, smells great!</li>
            <li> My nails and cuticles are in much better condition than before I used this product. I do love OPI products.</li>
            <li> I really like it but the fragrance is a bit too strong for me.  I am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the best g and and cuticle cream I have ever used. Light pleasant fragrance and works wonders on my housework and gardening hands!</li>
            <li> As a jewellery designer, I&#x27;m constantly working with my hands, filing my nails and building callouses. I also have a mild case of eczema, add that onto the dry winter wind and my hands are always in terrible condition. Sometimes it gets so bad that I wear gloves in the summer to protect other people from my hands ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this lotion in hopes that my hands can finally feel normal and not catch onto finer fabrics because of how rough it is. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days so far but there really is a huge difference ~! My nails aren&#x27;t breaking as easily, and the feeling between right after work and after using the lotion is incredible. I also like how the scent isn&#x27;t overbearing ~</li>
            <li> Love this product thank you, my hands are not dry anymore and you only need to use a little bit at a time, not oily at all and I love that.</li>
