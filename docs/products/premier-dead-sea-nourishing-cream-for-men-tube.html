            <li>but does have a very  good scent similar with Adidas after -shave, which we both liked.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, your man will love it.  </li>
            <li>he asked me to buy more .</li>
            <li>will get him more.</li>
            <li>Awesome facial freshness, without going broke.</li>
            <li>I just hope they are a bit cheaper so more affordable to order every month.</li>
            <li>Threw away most of it and would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure how write a review about this Item.</li>
            <li>I have no use for too many,</li>
            <li>it is not greasy, does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>PDS Nourishing Cream makes my skin feels smooth after application.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel great, better than any other balm I&#x27;ve tried and with no overpowering fragrance, I don&#x27;t knock people out at work.</li>
            <li>And yes...my bath towel is clean.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product</li>
            <li>not only helped clear my face noticeably better and still is geting better but is extremely smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>This Nourishing Cream leaves my skin soothed, and it dissolves into my skin very fast.  </li>
            <li>It is the first thing that has worked for him that does not come by prescription.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>This product is worth-it and would definitely recommend to users who wants a better, smoother looking face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and he will appreciate you thinking about his skin and not just yours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while and really like it because it works.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product for a while now and really likes it.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, but it leaves a funny smell on my face; kind of like a dirty towel...but not quite as strong.  </li>
            <li>This cream makes my face very young feeling!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product occasionally right after an Exfoliating Facial Gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time in a shopping mall in Washington DC years ago, mainly because the saleswoman promoting it was gorgeous (sorry not very PC).</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley they raised the price on this considerably and it takes about 3 weeks to get here shipping from Isreal.</li>
            <li>Use a dot on your face and 24 hours later your skin is still soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others with poor results.</li>
            <li>I purchase their complete line, i really don&#x27;t care for this one item, i just doesn&#x27;t feel the same as another company&#x27;s which uses dead sea minerals in it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it seems to moisturize well, although a little greasy as first.</li>

            <li> Overall, it seems to moisturize well, although a little greasy as first.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that hydrates my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell and lack of SPF are my only real complaints, but it really does smell quiet bad once the fragrance wears off.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it as long as I can buy it!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has an odd smell, and I&#x27;m not talking about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer has mentioned, once the fragrance wears off, it has an odd, almost petroleum smell that&#x27;s noticeable to others.</li>
            <li> Within minutes of application the skin absorbs the lotion and makes the skin softer with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A little at night &amp; in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy aroma to it like some others.</li>
            <li> An by the time I use the last  one, probably it&#x27;ll be outdated.</li>
            <li> and then I found it on Amazon for loads less!</li>
            <li> Usually after shaving no matter what I used as an aftershave, my shaving area still would be irritable.  </li>
            <li> Have used Clinique and Neutragena in the past</li>
            <li> I remember buying this product at a mall at a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> Everyone buy it and at least try it!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any men out there that are tired of trying lots and lots of after shave creams to avoid neck irritation after shaving !</li>

            <li> This is great stuff.  I use it as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> not bad ... shall update more if it is good</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as he has some flaking on his forehead and cheek area.  It worked wonders.  He says he loves it and his face looks great.  I&#x27;m going to try the shaving cream next.  Give it a try, your man will love it.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and he will appreciate you thinking about his skin and not just yours.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, but it leaves a funny smell on my face; kind of like a dirty towel...but not quite as strong.  And yes...my bath towel is clean.</li>

            <li> my husband liked this product. he asked me to buy more . it is not greasy, does not have a strong scent. but does have a very  good scent similar with Adidas after -shave, which we both liked. will get him more.</li>
            <li> If there is a product I swear by I think I will start with this one. not only helped clear my face noticeably better and still is geting better but is extremely smooth and fresh. Everyone buy it and at least try it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality facial product for men, without making you feel to girly. Awesome facial freshness, without going broke. Helps with your approach to ageing gracefully. Quality &amp; Value a product that shares both, a definite winner in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has an odd smell, and I&#x27;m not talking about the fragrance.  As another reviewer has mentioned, once the fragrance wears off, it has an odd, almost petroleum smell that&#x27;s noticeable to others. Overall, it seems to moisturize well, although a little greasy as first. The smell and lack of SPF are my only real complaints, but it really does smell quiet bad once the fragrance wears off. Others notice it. I&#x27;ll go with Neutrogena next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time in a shopping mall in Washington DC years ago, mainly because the saleswoman promoting it was gorgeous (sorry not very PC). Since then I&#x27;ve bought it loads of time using it as an after shave balm. It makes my skin feel great, better than any other balm I&#x27;ve tried and with no overpowering fragrance, I don&#x27;t knock people out at work.</li>
            <li> My husband has rosea and this product works wonders for his skin.  It is the first thing that has worked for him that does not come by prescription.  Delivery service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Usually after shaving no matter what I used as an aftershave, my shaving area still would be irritable.  This Nourishing Cream leaves my skin soothed, and it dissolves into my skin very fast.  It has a very pleasant fragrance as well.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and he loves it. I just hope they are a bit cheaper so more affordable to order every month.</li>
            <li> On face daily after shaving.  Have used ut before and was very happy wtih it.  Have used Clinique and Neutragena in the past and I prefer the Premier.</li>
            <li> My wife saya it makes my wrinkles smaller.  She knows best. A little at night &amp; in the morning.  It seems to work, I&#x27;ll get back to you in a year or so.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure how write a review about this Item. it is of great quality &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it. I ordered a set of 2 ea., and it have been sent 2 set &amp; charged fro the 2 set. I have no use for too many, An by the time I use the last  one, probably it&#x27;ll be outdated. As soon I noted the double order in the system, I tried to have one order canceled, but some house it couldn&#x27;t have done. ???????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, like it a lot. Not greasy or heavy aroma to it like some others.</li>
