            <li>It makes you feel cool and refreshing.  </li>

            <li>Received this for Christmas present in 2013 and have been using it ever since - great prices on Amazon for it.</li>
            <li>This is a mild, lovely, clean, beach-y fragrance.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love the fragrance and it smells just like the ocean, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I immediately feel in love with the light crisp scent.</li>
            <li>Has great smell and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this at Raglan Road in Downtown Disney in Orlando.</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into skin, providing a rich, softening effect.</li>
            <li>Light &amp; refreshing; clean &amp; uplifting; always my go-to and aromatherapy at any time during the day or night- a best kept secret-</li>
            <li>Smells clean, but just not what I was looking for......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean smelling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice and cool and makes the skin so wonderfully soft and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this so much considering it took me a while to search for it...</li>
            <li>So ofcourse I found it on one of my favorite places to shop Amazon, for a very comparable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, doesn&#x27;t hang on forever, but certainly long enough for you to enjoy it, and moisturizes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>A simple smell of this wonderful scent truely brings back the essence that surrrounds your senses in the Emerald Isle.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, light fragrance, and excellent moisterizing.  </li>
            <li>A clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is fresh and clean without being too floral or fruity, yet is still feminine.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>so fresh, clean and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean smell that always draws a compliment.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh smell..</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean is not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Fresh clean scent that I always get complimented on</li>
            <li>It smells nice, its subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this in a little shop in the Bahamas years ago was happy to find it again in Miami</li>
            <li>I only use it at home because it has quite a distinct perfume and many people would not appreciate being around me, either because they do not like the smell, or it is too potent for them, or they have allergies.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the shower gel, then the body lotion and finish with the cologne, which is what I discovered first.</li>
            <li>After buying this lotion down in Florida I was so happy to bring it home.  </li>
            <li>but it has that same kind of fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>, it is a fast, easy way to combat the drying skin that time and weather offer.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance, by far!  </li>
            <li>very pleasant lotion - not overpowering, subtle reminder of the shore,</li>
            <li>I little pricey, but a great treat.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully fresh fragrance; not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, worth the money for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a cross between a fresh mountain stream and freshly mown grass.  </li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, yet not overpowering.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I wear it, someone always asks me what I am wearing as it has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is lite and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>I received this right on time  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting clean unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li>Inis body lotion and body oil are rich with high quality moisturizers.</li>
            <li>A bit high in price, but worth it!</li>
            <li>A light scent almost reminds me of light blue by dolce and gabbana!!!</li>
            <li>Dramatically cheaper to buy here vs. the store I first found it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I received the product exactly as described and promptly.  </li>
            <li>I keep the top open on it</li>
            <li>I first received this lotion as a gift.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great and thick for winter.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for giving me a place to find it again!</li>
            <li>Most importantly only received compliments from others.</li>
            <li>Like the water and crisp air in Ireland</li>
            <li>First bought at surf shop  on vaca.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this scent at Bush Gardens in the Ireland section.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First purchased in St. Michaels, MD.  </li>
            <li>I first learned about Inis when traveling to South Carolina.</li>
            <li>It is just so pretty</li>
            <li>Even my son commented when I first wore this.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>It had almost the same smell as my old favorite!  </li>
            <li>Inis lotion has such a clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother patients!</li>
            <li>I live in a semi-arid climate, so need a rich moisturizer to prevent my skin from becoming overly dry.</li>
            <li>Such a clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item from a small beach shop in DE and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper than what I paid at the day spa.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I find I need to alternate it with a scent free lotion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabous fragrance.</li>
            <li>This body fragrance is really an out of body experience.  </li>
            <li>Too much perfume for a lotion in my opinion.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I already know the product, been using it for about 5 years and enjoy the scent, it reminds me of the Irish sea.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh scent, especially in the lotion...</li>
            <li>I have allergic reactions to most products from other fragrances manufacturers.</li>
            <li>No negative feedback!</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I know that it is difficult to purchase fragrances on line (without being able to smell them first) ,but if you like a clean,fresh scent,you will enjoy this..</li>
            <li>I bought the travel size products bc of the high price.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased to find this in a little boutique.  </li>
            <li>It is this time when I take a deep breath and smile.</li>
            <li>a fresh, clean but not overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li>A must try if you&#x27;re looking for a new summer scent.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, very green and lush!</li>
            <li>The lotion is not heavy, nor is it (in my view) for heavy duty dry skin, but it suits perfectly for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This is a very refreshing, spring-like scent that I don&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
            <li>Cost me less then what I had paid in Florida, plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frequently asked &amp;</li>
            <li>The body lotion keeps the skin soft while the scent has others remarking, &amp;#34;What are you wearing?  </li>
            <li>and it is so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>so its important to not wear heavy perfumes around patients with respiratory issues.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells then def do not buy this lotion.....</li>
            <li>the only way I can describe it is similar to blankets fresh out of the dryer after washing them in Downy......</li>
            <li>People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing, and the fragrance is so clean and suttle---not heavy and offensive.  </li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t anything different from my normal routine.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, it&#x27;s not too thick but has substance and can provide enough scent without the cologne.</li>
            <li>fresh fragrance, not flowery not fruity not sweet</li>
            <li>There is no other fragrance that can match it.  </li>
            <li>, it has none of the harsh, overly- chemical smells associated with many other products.</li>
            <li>I work with the public and get complimented on it frequently</li>
            <li>I am not a huge perfume fan but when i smelled this i had to have it, it is mild and enticing at the same time!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not one for wearing fragrances (they all appear too sweet smelling and too strong), but I like this body lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh.  </li>
            <li> Very fresh and inviting.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you enjoy light clean scents and don&#x27;t want to use two products.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, reminds me of clean and fresh smell of the sea.</li>
            <li> The fresh, clean scent is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance and it smells just like the ocean, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I immediately feel in love with the light crisp scent.</li>
            <li> Has great smell and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this at Raglan Road in Downtown Disney in Orlando.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into skin, providing a rich, softening effect.</li>
            <li> Light &amp; refreshing; clean &amp; uplifting; always my go-to and aromatherapy at any time during the day or night- a best kept secret-</li>
            <li> Smells clean, but just not what I was looking for......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean smelling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice and cool and makes the skin so wonderfully soft and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this so much considering it took me a while to search for it...</li>
            <li> So ofcourse I found it on one of my favorite places to shop Amazon, for a very comparable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, doesn&#x27;t hang on forever, but certainly long enough for you to enjoy it, and moisturizes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> A simple smell of this wonderful scent truely brings back the essence that surrrounds your senses in the Emerald Isle.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, light fragrance, and excellent moisterizing.  </li>
            <li> A clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is fresh and clean without being too floral or fruity, yet is still feminine.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> so fresh, clean and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean smell that always draws a compliment.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh smell..</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean is not over powering.  </li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent that I always get complimented on</li>
            <li> It smells nice, its subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this in a little shop in the Bahamas years ago was happy to find it again in Miami</li>
            <li> I only use it at home because it has quite a distinct perfume and many people would not appreciate being around me, either because they do not like the smell, or it is too potent for them, or they have allergies.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the shower gel, then the body lotion and finish with the cologne, which is what I discovered first.</li>
            <li> After buying this lotion down in Florida I was so happy to bring it home.  </li>
            <li> but it has that same kind of fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> , it is a fast, easy way to combat the drying skin that time and weather offer.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance, by far!  </li>
            <li> very pleasant lotion - not overpowering, subtle reminder of the shore,</li>
            <li> I little pricey, but a great treat.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully fresh fragrance; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, worth the money for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> Kind of like a cross between a fresh mountain stream and freshly mown grass.  </li>
            <li> It smells so fresh, yet not overpowering.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wear it, someone always asks me what I am wearing as it has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is lite and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> I received this right on time  </li>
            <li> Great long lasting clean unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li> Inis body lotion and body oil are rich with high quality moisturizers.</li>
            <li> A bit high in price, but worth it!</li>
            <li> A light scent almost reminds me of light blue by dolce and gabbana!!!</li>
            <li> Dramatically cheaper to buy here vs. the store I first found it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received the product exactly as described and promptly.  </li>
            <li> I keep the top open on it</li>
            <li> I first received this lotion as a gift.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great and thick for winter.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for giving me a place to find it again!</li>
            <li> Most importantly only received compliments from others.</li>
            <li> Like the water and crisp air in Ireland</li>
            <li> First bought at surf shop  on vaca.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this scent at Bush Gardens in the Ireland section.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First purchased in St. Michaels, MD.  </li>
            <li> I first learned about Inis when traveling to South Carolina.</li>
            <li> It is just so pretty</li>
            <li> Even my son commented when I first wore this.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It had almost the same smell as my old favorite!  </li>
            <li> Inis lotion has such a clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother patients!</li>
            <li> I live in a semi-arid climate, so need a rich moisturizer to prevent my skin from becoming overly dry.</li>
            <li> Such a clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item from a small beach shop in DE and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper than what I paid at the day spa.</li>
            <li> It is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I find I need to alternate it with a scent free lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabous fragrance.</li>
            <li> This body fragrance is really an out of body experience.  </li>
            <li> Too much perfume for a lotion in my opinion.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I already know the product, been using it for about 5 years and enjoy the scent, it reminds me of the Irish sea.  </li>
            <li> Very fresh scent, especially in the lotion...</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to most products from other fragrances manufacturers.</li>
            <li> No negative feedback!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I know that it is difficult to purchase fragrances on line (without being able to smell them first) ,but if you like a clean,fresh scent,you will enjoy this..</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size products bc of the high price.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased to find this in a little boutique.  </li>
            <li> It is this time when I take a deep breath and smile.</li>
            <li> a fresh, clean but not overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li> A must try if you&#x27;re looking for a new summer scent.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, very green and lush!</li>
            <li> The lotion is not heavy, nor is it (in my view) for heavy duty dry skin, but it suits perfectly for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing, spring-like scent that I don&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
            <li> Cost me less then what I had paid in Florida, plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frequently asked &amp;</li>
            <li> The body lotion keeps the skin soft while the scent has others remarking, &amp;#34;What are you wearing?  </li>
            <li> and it is so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> so its important to not wear heavy perfumes around patients with respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells then def do not buy this lotion.....</li>
            <li> the only way I can describe it is similar to blankets fresh out of the dryer after washing them in Downy......</li>
            <li> People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing, and the fragrance is so clean and suttle---not heavy and offensive.  </li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t anything different from my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it&#x27;s not too thick but has substance and can provide enough scent without the cologne.</li>
            <li> fresh fragrance, not flowery not fruity not sweet</li>
            <li> There is no other fragrance that can match it.  </li>
            <li> , it has none of the harsh, overly- chemical smells associated with many other products.</li>
            <li> I work with the public and get complimented on it frequently</li>
            <li> I am not a huge perfume fan but when i smelled this i had to have it, it is mild and enticing at the same time!</li>
            <li> At least for me, it hits all the right notes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I use the lotion for dry skin and for layering.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which probably absorbs it faster (I&#x27;m just guessing, here)</li>
            <li> However, because my skin is dry, I have to reapply lotion often throughout the day</li>
            <li> As for the lotion it isn&#x27;t made to treat dry skin, but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from getting dry skin either.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar and not overly expensive.  </li>
            <li> so it only lasted a few hours.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sea salt and other organic combinations</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this lotion at all due to the overpowering perfume-like smell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It was as expected and on time!!</li>
            <li> The smell or the lotion is nothing I can&#x27;t buy at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li> Thick cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I placed the order, it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> received it in a few days..</li>
            <li> The smell reminded me of almost a green tea smell.</li>
            <li> previously I had to stock up on my annual trips to Ireland to have it on hand!</li>
            <li> And for skin that&#x27;s been in the sun for the past 40 years, that says alot.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the blind only because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> it is now GONE in just a few months!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and usually fades away by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> You, at least, have to try it once.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick or sticky.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean this smells like Downy</li>
            <li> Hard to find!  </li>
            <li> I have used it sparingly since I was unable to get it anywhere</li>
            <li> I was unhappy when TSA confiscated it because it was over the ounce limit.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite fragrance, by far!  Found it in Ireland two years ago...and happy it&#x27;s sitting in the States as well!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Dramatically cheaper to buy here vs. the store I first found it.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this scent in a beach town in Florida. I bought the travel size products bc of the high price.  Found the full size on Amazon, with a great price and had to have it.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> A clean, fresh smell. I&#x27;m always asked what I have on. A must to keep!</li>
            <li> My mother and I love the fragrance and leaves your skin feeling silky.  We both get a lot of complements on the smell..</li>
            <li> smells amazing! It has a sort of manly smell if you get what I&#x27;m saying, but super satisfied with it :)</li>
            <li> I ran across this product while I was on vacation and loved the scent, light, airy, clean, so I decided to purchase it.  I can&#x27;t live without it now.  I even buy it online because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sea salt and other organic combinations, my skin has never felt so hydrated and smooth.  It even glows.  And for skin that&#x27;s been in the sun for the past 40 years, that says alot.  You, at least, have to try it once.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll become hooked.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance I have worn and the lotions is nice too</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item in Ireland and was so happy to find it on Amazon. You will love the scent...It is refreshing and just lovely. Whenever I wear just the lotion alone,I have many requests about what I am wearing and where did I get it...I know that it is difficult to purchase fragrances on line (without being able to smell them first) ,but if you like a clean,fresh scent,you will enjoy this..and it&#x27;s a pretty great lotion too~</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself. A friend had gone to Ireland and purchased this. I really like the scent. So when I saw it I thought I would treat myself. It is a very nice Fresh and clean smell. When I placed the order, it arrived in just a few days. Thanks!</li>
            <li> fresh fragrance, not flowery not fruity not sweet</li>
            <li> My wife first found this product in Ireland and liked it a lot, and it was great to find a source through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who admired the fragrance on me.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought the gift set in Ireland on our way from Iraq to the states for R&amp;R.  I was so thrilled to find it online and ordered two to maximize shipping cost savings.  This fragrance is fresh and clean without being too floral or fruity, yet is still feminine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream for my mother for Christmas.  She and I have both worn Inis since a trip to Ireland in 2004.  It is always a fresh clean scent and the lotion is perfect.  Not too thick or sticky.  I received the product exactly as described and promptly.  Will order again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, the smell is delicious, can not go without.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for over three months and will continue to use it.  Best lotion we have found.</li>
            <li> Light &amp; refreshing; clean &amp; uplifting; always my go-to and aromatherapy at any time during the day or night- a best kept secret-</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  It&#x27;s very fresh.  Although I will say it smelled different than when I had sampled it at a store.  The lotion I received smelled very strong and like alcohol.  I keep the top open on it and it seems that all of the alcohol smell has disappeared.  I did think thinking that in the store the container is probably always open.  I also like the way your skin feels after you put it on.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lotion is superb  and the fragrance  is fresh and lovely. I have allergic reactions to most products from other fragrances manufacturers. BUT Inis is made with such integrity, I have never experienced any adverse effect and ALWAYS enjoy their products.</li>
            <li> Love the clean fresh smell, love,love,love !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My friend said she loved this thought I would get it for her as a gift  just because she&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> So happy to know I could find this scent in the states. I bought it while in Ireland and fell in love with it. Thank you Amazon! It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells Great!  I love it..</li>
            <li> I only use it at home because it has quite a distinct perfume and many people would not appreciate being around me, either because they do not like the smell, or it is too potent for them, or they have allergies.  It is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and the price on Amazon is so much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  It is difficult for me to find locally.  I little pricey, but a great treat.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting clean unisex fragrance. Have bought many times.</li>
            <li> I received this right on time  and I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion on Hilton Head Island and fell in love with it.  Had to have more.  Thank you Amazon for coming to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells absolutely refreshing! I receive many compliments. I never want to run out so I keep extra on hand.</li>
            <li> This lotion has the most heavenly scent and does a wonderful job moisturizing. I first received this lotion as a gift. I am so happy that I could find more on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells clean, but just not what I was looking for......worked out as a gift to someone who likes it tho!</li>
            <li> Thick cream goes a long way.  Wonderfully fresh fragrance; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite scent. I wear it every day. I use the lotion for dry skin and for layering. Good price.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought the travel size cologne on the beach and loved it.  Now I ordered the shower gel, body lotion and bottle cologne. Everybody that smells it on the job loves it on me.  Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item from a small beach shop in DE and fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s refreshing, doesn&#x27;t hang on forever, but certainly long enough for you to enjoy it, and moisturizes beautifully.  Worth every dollar and not overly expensive.  I saved money purchasing it the second time from Amazon.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Smell and it&#x27;s great and thick for winter.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, smells  like a nice spring day. I get compliments every time i wear it. The body soap and lotion keep my skin feeling amazing. I wish I could get it by the gallon, lol.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, refreshing scent. An almost unisex fragrance that makes getting out of the shower to apply it to damp skin a treat. And the texture and moisturizing qualities can&#x27;t be beat. I live in a semi-arid climate, so need a rich moisturizer to prevent my skin from becoming overly dry. Inis body lotion and body oil are rich with high quality moisturizers. And...it&#x27;s NOT tested on animals. Makes getting out of the shower the best. Almost an aroma therapy experience. And if you like Inis, try Inis Moornlight.</li>
            <li> In March of 2008 I helped to chaparone our local highschool band trip to Ireland. My biggest treasure was to find this perfume. I have used it sparingly since I was unable to get it anywhere I&#x27;ve looked in the states. A simple smell of this wonderful scent truely brings back the essence that surrrounds your senses in the Emerald Isle. It smells like the air in Ireland. Beautiful. Thanks Amazon for giving me a place to find it again!</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, smells good - did I say that already?  I discovered this fragrance in Ireland and since I am a water girl, it appealed to me.  It reminds me of the sea and my home, the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
            <li> I purchased this body lotion along with the roll-on spray of Inis!  So happy I have both.  Love to layer the scents.  Long-lasting and luscious!  I&#x27;m frequently asked &amp;#34;what is the scent you are wearing?  Smells so good&amp;#34;  I know I have a winner!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance!  People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing, and the fragrance is so clean and suttle---not heavy and offensive.  A bit high in price, but worth it!</li>
            <li> This scent,  made in Ireland, is wonderful.. Very fresh scent, especially in the lotion...I hope to buy the perfume when I can afford it..A must try if you&#x27;re looking for a new summer scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the blind only because of the reviews.  It smells nice, its subtle and pleasant.  Most importantly only received compliments from others. No negative feedback!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for wearing fragrances (they all appear too sweet smelling and too strong), but I like this body lotion.  The scent lasts and I have gotten may compliments on it at the office.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, I love the smell of it.  Clean and fresh. Like the water and crisp air in Ireland</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell ..reminds me of beach. First bought at surf shop  on vaca.  And loved it. So re order online !!</li>
            <li> Just a lovely scent!  Lotion is nice - not over powering or greasy</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this scent at Bush Gardens in the Ireland section. I immediately feel in love with the light crisp scent. I  always price check items on Amazon, so when I got home I saw the price and with Amazon prime I could have it in 2 days. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! You will definitely love this scent!</li>
            <li> Love it- wonderful summer fragrance.  Very light and I use the bath gel and the spray with the body lotion so it lasts all day!  Smells clean and fresh, very green and lush!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you enjoy light clean scents and don&#x27;t want to use two products. Its a body lotion and perfume in one . A little goes a long way. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a mild, lovely, clean, beach-y fragrance. I get lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> I was so glad to be able to find this product.  I had bought this item at a day spa that I go to and they weren&#x27;t carrying it any longer.  I love the scent and the price.  It was so much cheaper than what I paid at the day spa.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice but as a lotion it doesn&#x27;t compare well to others.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm......it smells so good!  I only wish the smell lasted longer.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s different on different people.  I have dry skin which probably absorbs it faster (I&#x27;m just guessing, here) so it only lasted a few hours.  However, because my skin is dry, I have to reapply lotion often throughout the day so this isn&#x27;t anything different from my normal routine.  Now I just get to smell fabulous when I do it!  For those of you wondering about the smell....the only way I can describe it is similar to blankets fresh out of the dryer after washing them in Downy......a fresh, clean but not overwhelming scent.  That doesn&#x27;t mean this smells like Downy but it has that same kind of fresh, clean smell.  It&#x27;s not a girly girly flower smell nor is it citrus.  It&#x27;s just clean.  Without a doubt, worth the money for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and great lotion. Love the shea butter in it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great, My wife loves it.  Has great smell and lasts a long time.  She says she will buy again.  This was a great value for her.</li>
            <li> There is no other fragrance that can match it.  Very fresh and inviting. It is not irritating at all. I would highly recommend it. Buy more than one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. It&#x27;s ok and I can tolerate it but I was expecting something more based on all the great reviews. I think I could find something similar in stores. As for the lotion it isn&#x27;t made to treat dry skin, but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from getting dry skin either.</li>
            <li> This very good and nice .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. .and received it in a few days..</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have very dry skin and it relieves the dryness very nicely.  It smells wonderful!  Kind of like a cross between a fresh mountain stream and freshly mown grass.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Inis is one of the most refreshing fragrances on the market.  The body lotion keeps the skin soft while the scent has others remarking, &amp;#34;What are you wearing?  It smells so fresh, yet not overpowering.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a body lotion that leaves your skin feeling good and smelling good all day long!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance and have received many complemts</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, my favorite fragrance.  The lotion is perfect since it provides a lovely scent without having to use perfume or cologne.  The lotion is not heavy, nor is it (in my view) for heavy duty dry skin, but it suits perfectly for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I originally found this in a little shop in the Bahamas years ago was happy to find it again in Miami but now that I have found it on Amazon I&#x27;m so happy!....Everyone gives me so many complements on how great I smell, I love love love this scent!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I get so many compliments when I wear it! I&#x27;m allergic to so many products and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, reminds me of clean and fresh smell of the sea.</li>
            <li> I discovered this fragrance seversl months ago and I love it - so fresh, clean and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Goes great paired with the shower gel and perfume as well.  It is the whole package and best scent of Ireland!!</li>
            <li> lovely smell and texture. the smell can become a bit overpowering with daily use. I find I need to alternate it with a scent free lotion.</li>
            <li> Love, love the scent.  First purchased in St. Michaels, MD.  When I wear it, someone always asks me what I am wearing as it has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Lathers super fast -rich and moisturizing...and the fragrance is gorgeous...  so clean and fresh..see my review of the lotion...you&#x27;re gonna love this!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this at Raglan Road in Downtown Disney in Orlando. I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon. It is fresh and clean smelling and is a wonderful moisturizing lotion. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into skin, providing a rich, softening effect. Non- staining to clothing, it is a fast, easy way to combat the drying skin that time and weather offer. A light fragrance, found in nature, it has none of the harsh, overly- chemical smells associated with many other products.</li>
            <li> Always a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this lotion at all due to the overpowering perfume-like smell. I wanted to love this so much considering it took me a while to search for it... oh well</li>
            <li> I am not a huge perfume fan but when i smelled this i had to have it, it is mild and enticing at the same time! You will love it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Clean smelling</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabous fragrance. I have used for several years. Fragrance is lite and fresh smelling. Have had many many complements. I use the cream and cologne. Lasts aong time</li>
            <li> This body fragrance is really an out of body experience.  It makes you feel cool and refreshing.  A light scent almost reminds me of light blue by dolce and gabbana!!!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom every year for her birthday; it&#x27;s her favorite scent and she always asks me to get it again! It&#x27;s great for people who are sensitive to smells because it has a really light scent.</li>
            <li> this is a very refreshing fragrance. Love it because it doesn&#x27;t spell like everything else.</li>
            <li> My mom got hooked on this stuff while on vacation in Ireland and 4 years later still loves it.  Everytime she is running out I get a phone call to order her more.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Another overpriced body lotion. The smell or the lotion is nothing I can&#x27;t buy at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent for the summer!</li>
            <li> get so many compliments when I use this lotion. Great price nice size</li>
            <li> I first learned about Inis when traveling to South Carolina. I was presented the lotion as a gift and when we went shopping, we found great shop that carried it.  I purchased some for my trip home and for a gift.  I love to put it on right before dressing in the morning.  Throughout the day, a scent of its fragrance finds my nose. It is this time when I take a deep breath and smile.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its the only scent I use.  i&#x27;m always checking to see if this is available.  I have also brought the perfume.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FRAGRANCE. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN LANCASTER PA. I LOVED IT. I WAS SO HAPPY AMAZON CARRIED THIS FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Got for the girlfriend and she loves it.  It does have a strong fragrance smell, so if you don&#x27;t want something that overwhelms your perfume, avoid this.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I alway get compliments on how fresh I smell when I use this lotion, Love it!!</li>
            <li> The fresh, clean scent is fabulous! People stop me all the time and ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing. I use the lotion and perfume spray every day. Love, love, love them both.  This is the only scent I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> Used this fragrance for years and still get commence on it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  The scent is wonderful, and the creme is rich without being greasy.  Will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Love this energy of the sea body lotion. It is trully nice and relaxing in everyway. Love it, my lady loves love it!</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful pick-me-up ever!!.  It has a very light and lovely fragrance and also is very good for the skin.  Love to put it on fresh out of the shower and have it melt into my skin. It&#x27;s so nice and cool and makes the skin so wonderfully soft and fragrant.  I just love the body lotion as well as the perfume.</li>
            <li> After buying this lotion down in Florida I was so happy to bring it home.  I was unhappy when TSA confiscated it because it was over the ounce limit.  I think she just wanted it for herself.  After coming home I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in town.  Amazon had it.  Again I an amazed at the inventory they have.  Cost me less then what I had paid in Florida, plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> Too much perfume for a lotion in my opinion.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!  Wonderful scent, fresh not flowery, even my husband loves to use it.  Takes care of my dry hands and cracked heels beautifully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body lotion.  I get compliments on the fragrance and it is so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> love this hand cream to go with the parfum</li>
            <li> I love Inis lotion.  I work in health care so its important to not wear heavy perfumes around patients with respiratory issues. Inis lotion has such a clean smell and doesn&#x27;t bother patients! I am so happy that I can buy the lotion through Amazon,  previously I had to stock up on my annual trips to Ireland to have it on hand! Thank you Amazon!! Great price too and home delivery!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, the way it keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and the compliments I receive when I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It has a very strong smell, but I like that. If you are sensitive to smells then def do not buy this lotion..... I also love the fact that it is not greasy. I feel like bath and body works lotions have more oil in them so I never like using them. This seems to be more water based so it doesnt leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Couple Inis:Energy of the Sea Body Lotion with the bath and shower gel and you have a winning pair!  Long lasting, light fragrance, and excellent moisterizing.  Feeling special?...treat yourself to the cologne as well.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best body lotion on the market!</li>
            <li> Very clean fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Love it - scent is wonderful and goes on without being greasy - absorbs quickly and lasts most of the day subtlely.</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing, spring-like scent that I don&#x27;t get tired of. I have both the lotion and the shower gel--yummy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my daughter. She absolutely loves this product. I also think the fragrance is terrific.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this magical fragrance in Killarney, and it has been my favorite ever since. It is light, not overpowering, and truly does evoke the energy of the sea. The lotion is creamy, not greasy, and keeps my skin moisturized with a hint of scent all day.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean smell that always draws a compliment. This takes the place of cologne but has a very light, understated scent.</li>
            <li> This is such a great smell. I tried to find it in Ireland but had no luck.I will use it often.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent when a coworker came in wearing it. It is just so pretty, she purchased her lotion on one of her many trips to Ireland. So ofcourse I found it on one of my favorite places to shop Amazon, for a very comparable price. I am very happy this is available to purchase, because I cannot afford to travel to Ireland right now to get a bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Really moisturizes your skin and leaves it feeling soft with a great fragrance!!  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, good mositurizer, makes me sneeze once since i have allergies, but after that I&#x27;m fine. Good product. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It was as expected and on time!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unreal. I wish I could leave a dollop under my nostrils to last throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Hard to find!  Love the lotions.  Not sticky,  Scent light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been using Inis for years and I love it.  Such a clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> My co-worker had a bottle of this.....I could not keep stealing hers so I purchased one myself....it is now GONE in just a few months!  Clean fresh smell..we all love it!!</li>
            <li> very pleasant lotion - not overpowering, subtle reminder of the shore, perfect to go with the cologne</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance and it smells just like the ocean, clean and fresh. It was a birthday gift for myself to me and i love it. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have actually on two occasions had people follow me to ask me what I was wearing, one even said, &amp;#34;I am not meaning to stalk you, but your fragrance is so beautiful, I need to find ot what you&#x27;re wearing.&amp;#34; Add to the fragrance the great feel on the skin and the moisturizing effect....this is now my signature scent.</li>
            <li> Just ok. The smell reminded me of almost a green tea smell. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great price, love this product.</li>
            <li> This has become my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.  I&#x27;ve received more compliments on it everywhere - from doctor&#x27;s office to grocery checkout line.  I&#x27;ve made it a gift to friends and a PT doctor who almost each time I came in.  It has a very clean and pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  At least for me, it hits all the right notes.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for Christmas.....this was just what she wanted at a good price.</li>
            <li> Lovely light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I already know the product, been using it for about 5 years and enjoy the scent, it reminds me of the Irish sea.  I&#x27;ve tried other lotions but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> As I indicated in my review of the shower gel, I discovered Inis while traveling in Florida. I really enjoy using the shower gel, then the body lotion and finish with the cologne, which is what I discovered first. The fragrance has a very clean and pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This item has a clean fresh smell and more importantly is does not feel greasy. The scent is light and not cloying. I am comfortable wearing it to the office.</li>
            <li> Have a very good scent</li>
            <li> Love the clean smell! The men in my family enjoy using it too</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent. Even my son commented when I first wore this. Fresh and clean is not over powering.  Simply delightful  and refreshing!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it&#x27;s not too thick but has substance and can provide enough scent without the cologne. Fresh clean scent that I always get complimented on</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.. First came upon it in While traveling in Ireland &amp; delighted to be able to buy product here in u.s.</li>
            <li> Althought not a fan of the Inis perfume, the lotion is my favorite.  Received this for Christmas present in 2013 and have been using it ever since - great prices on Amazon for it.</li>
            <li> I use to wear Naia  by Thymes until they discontinued  the scent and I was so pleased to find this in a little boutique.  I absolutely  love it! I work with the public and get complimented on it frequently</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for a lotion with this smell!  I used to purchase a similar product through VitaSpa years ago until they stopped making it.  The smell was incredible and reminded me of the ocean.  Just recently on vacation, I ran across this lotion and had to purchase it!  It had almost the same smell as my old favorite!  The smell is just one of those smells that you fall in love with.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering and usually fades away by the end of the day.  But the lotion itself is fantastic!  Rich and creamy and absorbs very well.  I am so happy Amazon is selling this and INIS is making this!  :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion, now I want to get the perfume spray.</li>
