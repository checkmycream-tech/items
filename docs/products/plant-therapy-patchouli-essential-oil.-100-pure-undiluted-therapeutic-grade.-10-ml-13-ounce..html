            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  </li>
            <li>Good quality patchouli oil and smells great.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it was now fairly pleasant in</li>
            <li>Not too strong and perfect.</li>
            <li>The oil is of good quality hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get used to that fairly soon to stop smelling....</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>and you also smell bark), then something a bit like suede and something musky (in a good way) that I couldn&#x27;t quite describe.</li>
            <li>This is where it gets good.</li>
            <li>Good size, good concentration.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Good stuff man.</li>
            <li>I order a lot of oil from Plant Therapy, I have been very satisfied with all of them</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the seller contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love Patchouli and this brand is GREAT</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li>Use for insect bites, nothing works better, nothing!  </li>
            <li>I use a couple drops in my witch hazel, for cleansing face and refreshing underarms!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>A most pleasant encounter with the manufacturer&#x27;s Customer Service rep explained the how capping machine sometimes does this.  </li>
            <li>I must say I was very impressed with my customer service interaction; that will certainly draw my repeat business with this merchant.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if I had to name the lingering scent of Patchouli, I would call it Autumn Fairy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know what that smelled liked, but this doesn&#x27;t make me think &amp;#34;hippies&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>smells lovely, good value</li>
            <li>Then, after a while, I decided to try it again on its own.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>They have excellent prices when compared to other companies and they&#x27;re quality is very good.</li>
            <li>Loved the oil and am currently enjoying it in so many things.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li>, when I first smelled it from the bottle it was very strong and didn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice rich earthy smell, but once on your body turns into a nice woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>Not overly powerful, just pleasant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Patchouli, and this essential oil has a perfect authentic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this sent.</li>
            <li>My patients love when I wear this.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, calming and would buy again.</li>
            <li>and I still love today.</li>
            <li>I love plant therapy.</li>
            <li>I have purchased lots of oils from them and have been quite pleased.</li>
            <li>It is musky and more of a &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; type of patchouli aroma.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest smelling patchouli essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I have smelt and used better.</li>
            <li>yet leaving me wanting more.</li>
            <li>Lovely and earthy fragrance</li>
            <li>They offered to replace the bottle, but I was satisfied with the explanation.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine how the product could be any better.</li>
            <li>Even better.</li>
            <li>(You have a stronger and probably more sophisticated stomach/palate than I do.)</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a good fresh patchouli in a well sealed bottle.</li>
            <li>cheap cheap cheap and great value - thank you</li>
            <li>You can tell this produce is more concentrated than most which makes it easier to deal with the price.</li>
            <li>I love it and will order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>luv it!  :)</li>
            <li>Really love ‚ù§ it.</li>
            <li>and it sure doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>Have had many friends comment and borrow.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and the smell is very strong and earthy, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just say this: If you LOVE it at first, good for you.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems really high quality, however, and I am generally happy with it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the strong scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I dont think it is pure.</li>
            <li>just right for many aromatherapy applications!</li>
            <li>This has a great &#x27;old school&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own right, and did remind me of the (neuvo-80s) hippies I knew in college.</li>
            <li>but it seemed to me as if I ran out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>do to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to put the cotton ball away because the scent was so strong.</li>
            <li>The tranquility is actually my favorite, but I add a bit of this and it is just right!</li>
            <li>GREAT OLD ORIGINAL 60&#x27;S SMELL</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, very strong and last a long time but you will need to buy more often.</li>
            <li>This Patchouli Oil has a fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Totally fills my rooms with the great oil fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for this great essential oil.</li>
            <li>They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
            <li>My guy likes patchouli, so for Valentines Day I thought it would be thoughtful to get some and experiment with it.</li>
            <li>This fragrant oil arrived securely wrapped and packaged for safety.  </li>
            <li>Used to make homemade lotion and smells great mixed with sandalwood and ginger.</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel Distillate (Alcohol Free) 8 Ounces]]</li>
            <li>well and packaging is important to to aging it well.</li>
            <li>I do believe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to cheap patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li>Mixed some with Eucalyptus oil and that&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li>This stuff may be great at first for you, depending on your taste and, more importantly, on how old or fresh the oil you receive is.</li>
            <li>A drop on a cool light bulb, turn light on and enjoy the aroma.</li>
            <li>Love getting new oils!!!</li>
            <li>After a couple of more weeks, it was very, very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil smells great all day long and into the night.</li>
            <li>, other people love me because of the room filling pleasant patchouli smell.</li>
            <li>The musky smell now provided a very nice, sort of bass note, a \\&quot;tethered-to-the-earth\\&quot; sensuality to deeply accent the wonderful, bright, higher notes that had emerged above</li>
            <li>Of course, I had heard this, but I assumed 2 things: first, that it was a many months to years kind of thing, even if it was true, and second, that it was probably connoisseur subjective bs for the most part.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the quality exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Nice smelling and reminds me of the old days.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The stuff about patchouli improving with age is actually true.</li>
            <li>It really did get a LOT better.</li>
            <li>I know I love the patchouli scent, but after this am wondering if what I am used to isn&#x27;t &#x27;real&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Quick service.  </li>
            <li>The very iconic patchouli scent is in this bottle, it last a while</li>
            <li>Yes, the very first thing you smell is the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>For the record, all of my descriptions are just things I have no other way of describing more accurately.)</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly as stated!</li>
            <li>It really does change over time, and relatively quickly!</li>
            <li>I felt calm when I used under nose</li>
            <li>Patchouli is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent by far.</li>
            <li>stuff is powerful; that one drop was all I needed.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and using in several of my blends.</li>
            <li>Been using this oil for several years, this one was a reasonable price and a good quality.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said she had a strong negative reaction to this oil at first and liked it better after time passed (the scent oxidized, perhaps?).</li>
            <li>100% pure therapeutic grade is what I was looking for, high quality and contaminant free are important to me when I am putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smelled to good to just be the patchouli, so I figured it was mixing with some other oils that had residual smell in there.</li>
            <li>, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>Perhaps having the acid in your skin coming into contact with the bottle contents right away is the catalyst for the change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At the beginning the smell is strong but it will go away after a few minutes and after that you get the nice smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li>The smell is pure and clean and smells exactly like the plant.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t researched that part of it yet, but it smells soft, and woodsy; its strong but not overpowering either.</li>
            <li>It brings back such great memories.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense with the no waste spout inside.  </li>
            <li>This oil becomes extremely sophisticated and enjoyable in an almost ineffable way within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>blends beautifully with so many other oils.(a drop of black pepper with this</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the Glade spray smells more like men&#x27;s cologne; the Patchouli definitely smells more feminine - a soft, gentle, perfume-y, &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>this is a very pure oil appropriate to use for (topical) therapeutic purposes.</li>
            <li>First time to smell this oil</li>
            <li>This is why you can find many different colors and aroma profiles on the market. .</li>
            <li>You may have put a tad too much on!</li>
            <li>Can be combined with many other fragrances to form something unique for you.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mixed with a wee bit of orange.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to me to be exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>At first I said \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables.</li>
            <li>That is the first time a seller on Amzaon has done that.  </li>
            <li>Yup, same product as before(2nd time ordering it)  -- smells better than those I&#x27;ve smelled in boutiques.</li>
            <li>but it only cost about $8, free shipping, &amp; it does the job!  </li>
            <li>The heavy, musty aroma that I loved in the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  </li>
            <li>I have been along time user of patchouli and it seems more and more hard to find.  </li>
            <li>That is the image this scent gives me: feminine; a soft, warm glow; a wood of amber-colored fallfoliage, and woodland creatures such as fawns, minks, and baby</li>
            <li>Then I smelled the lovely scent of Patchouli all day long on me</li>
            <li>It was reasonable and doesn&#x27;t have additives which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This essential oil has a strong smokey-woody-vegetable mold bouquet of odors.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not used to 100% pure patchouli</li>
            <li>Pure oil is supposed to drop out of the bottle, not pour.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the scent lasted over 24 hours, I&#x27;m going to say it is probably rather pure as described.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells much earthier.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having this product.</li>
            <li>This is VERY watery.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff though</li>
            <li>and I was okay with it, but not what I had expected.</li>
            <li>is absolutely</li>
            <li>so his whole car smell like it</li>
            <li>essential oil I could find on Amazon that was for under $10 and qualified for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is very relaxing and therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>This one has a very medicinal aroma.  </li>
            <li>Too earthy, too musky, and really, downright rotten.</li>
            <li>(Which I really doubt.)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>This will definitely help me with grounding, leaving behind a perfect fall fragrance.</li>
            <li>Would buy from this seller in a hot New York minute.</li>
            <li>At first the scent was neither good nor bad, just interesting...</li>
            <li>and it smells like the original back in the 60s.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other patchouli oils and had had so many complements, but none with this one.  </li>
            <li>I originally chose this item because I wanted an essential oil to use for aromatherapy for grounding.</li>
            <li>Other then that I love this oil.</li>
            <li>but I feel like i don&#x27;t love this brands fragrance oil as much as other patchoulis I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li>I AM the guy whose original title said simply \\&quot;Yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables.</li>
            <li>I read that any earthy scent is good for grounding; I chose this product frankly because I am on a tight budget and this was the only &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole oils thing, so I don&#x27;t know if this is a quality oil or not.</li>
            <li>This item came very quickly and was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor, but that is expected with this oil, anyone ordering should know that.</li>
            <li>This is quality oil; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High potency and does the job.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, concentrated grade.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love adding it to my bath, I add a little to a kerchief for my handbags.</li>
            <li>(No, I&#x27;m not one of those bs&#x27;ers that normally talks about aromas in this way.</li>
            <li>The light notes became quite powerful, and had a distinctively citrus-like quality, but not exactly citrus, just very similar.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the oil dissipates quickly and does not linger long on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am new to patchouli, so I will end the product content comparison there.  </li>
            <li>It helped out a bit with my dry throat, mouth, and vocal cord, however if you are experiencing that issue,  grab cats claw and chia seeds first to really repair and hydrate your self and then use this product to help expand your range, and advance your healing progress.</li>
            <li>(the big but first)</li>
            <li>I like it, but it wasn&#x27;t as sweet smelling as I expected.  </li>
            <li>though, it may have a certain under-note that I&#x27;ve only identified as &amp;#34;tonic-y&amp;#34; ??  </li>
            <li>It smells so natural</li>
            <li>Patchouli Essential Oil is not for everyone, but my husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it and was surprised to find it helps relieve the pain and keep the joint in my neck from locking up.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I remember from long ago</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, this is from smelling directly from the bottle, and/or, from smelling the oil directly from the bottle dropped onto my desk, my skin, etc.</li>
            <li>I might have found something I like when I find some use for it since I am into homeopathic or natural remedies and alternative medicine.</li>
            <li>have used this a few times as a body scent, but yes, I primarily use it as a combination element with witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I smelled it a few weeks later, and it smelled better.</li>
            <li>My friends know when I am approaching and many foreign people think I am sorta of guru for chinese medicine or the like...</li>
            <li>The musky, earthy aspect was still there, but now it had transformed from a dominant, smothering aroma, to a MUCH more subtle, background scent.</li>
            <li>I use as a cologne and just started putting it in my daily facial moisturizer and combined six or so drops in my large bottle of hemp body moisturizer ....</li>
            <li>First time after opening the bottle you will regret not listening what other reviews say.</li>
            <li>However, there are other points in the overall purchase experience worth mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since a little goes a long way with this aroma, I look forward to enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Have been using scented oils for years and never had a bottle this size empty so fast.  </li>
            <li>From a heavy, earthy, yucky (to me) smell, and began to develop very surprisingly powerful lighter notes.</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops but the scent stays with you and is a true patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick, dark patchouli essential oil that has the long-lasting quality I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I mean, seriously, SIGNIFICANTLY changed.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other Plant Essentials products and noticed normal fill variation, but always from full to over-full; never under-filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon receipt of this particular bottle, the four little plastic connector strands between the lower rim of the screw cap and the black plastic collar were snapped.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the essential oil extract is different from what they do with perfume - a big relief to me.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  </li>
            <li> Good quality patchouli oil and smells great.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it was now fairly pleasant in</li>
            <li> Not too strong and perfect.</li>
            <li> The oil is of good quality hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get used to that fairly soon to stop smelling....</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> and you also smell bark), then something a bit like suede and something musky (in a good way) that I couldn&#x27;t quite describe.</li>
            <li> This is where it gets good.</li>
            <li> Good size, good concentration.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Good stuff man.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of oil from Plant Therapy, I have been very satisfied with all of them</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the seller contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love Patchouli and this brand is GREAT</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the quality of this product!</li>

            <li> I use a couple drops in my witch hazel, for cleansing face and refreshing underarms!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> A most pleasant encounter with the manufacturer&#x27;s Customer Service rep explained the how capping machine sometimes does this.  </li>
            <li> I must say I was very impressed with my customer service interaction; that will certainly draw my repeat business with this merchant.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if I had to name the lingering scent of Patchouli, I would call it Autumn Fairy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know what that smelled liked, but this doesn&#x27;t make me think &amp;#34;hippies&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> smells lovely, good value</li>
            <li> Then, after a while, I decided to try it again on its own.</li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> They have excellent prices when compared to other companies and they&#x27;re quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Loved the oil and am currently enjoying it in so many things.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li> , when I first smelled it from the bottle it was very strong and didn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
            <li> It has a nice rich earthy smell, but once on your body turns into a nice woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> Not overly powerful, just pleasant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Patchouli, and this essential oil has a perfect authentic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this sent.</li>
            <li> My patients love when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, calming and would buy again.</li>
            <li> and I still love today.</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased lots of oils from them and have been quite pleased.</li>
            <li> It is musky and more of a &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; type of patchouli aroma.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest smelling patchouli essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I have smelt and used better.</li>
            <li> yet leaving me wanting more.</li>
            <li> Lovely and earthy fragrance</li>
            <li> They offered to replace the bottle, but I was satisfied with the explanation.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine how the product could be any better.</li>
            <li> Even better.</li>
            <li> (You have a stronger and probably more sophisticated stomach/palate than I do.)</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a good fresh patchouli in a well sealed bottle.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap and great value - thank you</li>
            <li> You can tell this produce is more concentrated than most which makes it easier to deal with the price.</li>
            <li> I love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> luv it!  :)</li>
            <li> Really love ‚ù§ it.</li>
            <li> and it sure doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Have had many friends comment and borrow.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and the smell is very strong and earthy, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say this: If you LOVE it at first, good for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems really high quality, however, and I am generally happy with it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the strong scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I dont think it is pure.</li>
            <li> just right for many aromatherapy applications!</li>
            <li> This has a great &#x27;old school&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own right, and did remind me of the (neuvo-80s) hippies I knew in college.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to me as if I ran out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Got it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> do to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to put the cotton ball away because the scent was so strong.</li>
            <li> The tranquility is actually my favorite, but I add a bit of this and it is just right!</li>
            <li> GREAT OLD ORIGINAL 60&#x27;S SMELL</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, very strong and last a long time but you will need to buy more often.</li>
            <li> This Patchouli Oil has a fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Totally fills my rooms with the great oil fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for this great essential oil.</li>
            <li> They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
            <li> My guy likes patchouli, so for Valentines Day I thought it would be thoughtful to get some and experiment with it.</li>
            <li> This fragrant oil arrived securely wrapped and packaged for safety.  </li>
            <li> Used to make homemade lotion and smells great mixed with sandalwood and ginger.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel Distillate (Alcohol Free) 8 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> well and packaging is important to to aging it well.</li>
            <li> I do believe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to cheap patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li> Mixed some with Eucalyptus oil and that&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li> This stuff may be great at first for you, depending on your taste and, more importantly, on how old or fresh the oil you receive is.</li>
            <li> A drop on a cool light bulb, turn light on and enjoy the aroma.</li>
            <li> Love getting new oils!!!</li>
            <li> After a couple of more weeks, it was very, very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil smells great all day long and into the night.</li>
            <li> , other people love me because of the room filling pleasant patchouli smell.</li>
            <li> The musky smell now provided a very nice, sort of bass note, a \\&quot;tethered-to-the-earth\\&quot; sensuality to deeply accent the wonderful, bright, higher notes that had emerged above</li>
            <li> Of course, I had heard this, but I assumed 2 things: first, that it was a many months to years kind of thing, even if it was true, and second, that it was probably connoisseur subjective bs for the most part.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the quality exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and reminds me of the old days.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very earthy and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The stuff about patchouli improving with age is actually true.</li>
            <li> It really did get a LOT better.</li>
            <li> I know I love the patchouli scent, but after this am wondering if what I am used to isn&#x27;t &#x27;real&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Quick service.  </li>
            <li> The very iconic patchouli scent is in this bottle, it last a while</li>
            <li> Yes, the very first thing you smell is the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> For the record, all of my descriptions are just things I have no other way of describing more accurately.)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly as stated!</li>
            <li> It really does change over time, and relatively quickly!</li>
            <li> I felt calm when I used under nose</li>
            <li> Patchouli is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent by far.</li>
            <li> stuff is powerful; that one drop was all I needed.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and using in several of my blends.</li>
            <li> Been using this oil for several years, this one was a reasonable price and a good quality.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said she had a strong negative reaction to this oil at first and liked it better after time passed (the scent oxidized, perhaps?).</li>
            <li> 100% pure therapeutic grade is what I was looking for, high quality and contaminant free are important to me when I am putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smelled to good to just be the patchouli, so I figured it was mixing with some other oils that had residual smell in there.</li>
            <li> , butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> Perhaps having the acid in your skin coming into contact with the bottle contents right away is the catalyst for the change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At the beginning the smell is strong but it will go away after a few minutes and after that you get the nice smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li> The smell is pure and clean and smells exactly like the plant.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t researched that part of it yet, but it smells soft, and woodsy; its strong but not overpowering either.</li>
            <li> It brings back such great memories.</li>
            <li> Easy to dispense with the no waste spout inside.  </li>
            <li> This oil becomes extremely sophisticated and enjoyable in an almost ineffable way within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> blends beautifully with so many other oils.(a drop of black pepper with this</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the Glade spray smells more like men&#x27;s cologne; the Patchouli definitely smells more feminine - a soft, gentle, perfume-y, &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> this is a very pure oil appropriate to use for (topical) therapeutic purposes.</li>
            <li> First time to smell this oil</li>
            <li> This is why you can find many different colors and aroma profiles on the market. .</li>
            <li> You may have put a tad too much on!</li>
            <li> Can be combined with many other fragrances to form something unique for you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mixed with a wee bit of orange.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to me to be exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> At first I said \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables.</li>
            <li> That is the first time a seller on Amzaon has done that.  </li>
            <li> Yup, same product as before(2nd time ordering it)  -- smells better than those I&#x27;ve smelled in boutiques.</li>
            <li> but it only cost about $8, free shipping, &amp; it does the job!  </li>
            <li> The heavy, musty aroma that I loved in the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  </li>
            <li> I have been along time user of patchouli and it seems more and more hard to find.  </li>
            <li> That is the image this scent gives me: feminine; a soft, warm glow; a wood of amber-colored fallfoliage, and woodland creatures such as fawns, minks, and baby</li>
            <li> Then I smelled the lovely scent of Patchouli all day long on me</li>
            <li> It was reasonable and doesn&#x27;t have additives which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This essential oil has a strong smokey-woody-vegetable mold bouquet of odors.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not used to 100% pure patchouli</li>
            <li> Pure oil is supposed to drop out of the bottle, not pour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the scent lasted over 24 hours, I&#x27;m going to say it is probably rather pure as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells much earthier.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having this product.</li>
            <li> This is VERY watery.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff though</li>
            <li> and I was okay with it, but not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> is absolutely</li>
            <li> so his whole car smell like it</li>
            <li> essential oil I could find on Amazon that was for under $10 and qualified for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very relaxing and therapeutic.  </li>
            <li> This one has a very medicinal aroma.  </li>
            <li> Too earthy, too musky, and really, downright rotten.</li>
            <li> (Which I really doubt.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely help me with grounding, leaving behind a perfect fall fragrance.</li>
            <li> Would buy from this seller in a hot New York minute.</li>
            <li> At first the scent was neither good nor bad, just interesting...</li>
            <li> and it smells like the original back in the 60s.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other patchouli oils and had had so many complements, but none with this one.  </li>
            <li> I originally chose this item because I wanted an essential oil to use for aromatherapy for grounding.</li>
            <li> Other then that I love this oil.</li>
            <li> but I feel like i don&#x27;t love this brands fragrance oil as much as other patchoulis I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> I AM the guy whose original title said simply \\&quot;Yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables.</li>
            <li> I read that any earthy scent is good for grounding; I chose this product frankly because I am on a tight budget and this was the only &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole oils thing, so I don&#x27;t know if this is a quality oil or not.</li>
            <li> This item came very quickly and was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor, but that is expected with this oil, anyone ordering should know that.</li>
            <li> This is quality oil; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High potency and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, concentrated grade.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love adding it to my bath, I add a little to a kerchief for my handbags.</li>
            <li> (No, I&#x27;m not one of those bs&#x27;ers that normally talks about aromas in this way.</li>
            <li> The light notes became quite powerful, and had a distinctively citrus-like quality, but not exactly citrus, just very similar.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the oil dissipates quickly and does not linger long on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am new to patchouli, so I will end the product content comparison there.  </li>
            <li> It helped out a bit with my dry throat, mouth, and vocal cord, however if you are experiencing that issue,  grab cats claw and chia seeds first to really repair and hydrate your self and then use this product to help expand your range, and advance your healing progress.</li>
            <li> (the big but first)</li>
            <li> I like it, but it wasn&#x27;t as sweet smelling as I expected.  </li>
            <li> though, it may have a certain under-note that I&#x27;ve only identified as &amp;#34;tonic-y&amp;#34; ??  </li>
            <li> It smells so natural</li>
            <li> Patchouli Essential Oil is not for everyone, but my husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it and was surprised to find it helps relieve the pain and keep the joint in my neck from locking up.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I remember from long ago</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this is from smelling directly from the bottle, and/or, from smelling the oil directly from the bottle dropped onto my desk, my skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I might have found something I like when I find some use for it since I am into homeopathic or natural remedies and alternative medicine.</li>
            <li> have used this a few times as a body scent, but yes, I primarily use it as a combination element with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I smelled it a few weeks later, and it smelled better.</li>
            <li> My friends know when I am approaching and many foreign people think I am sorta of guru for chinese medicine or the like...</li>
            <li> The musky, earthy aspect was still there, but now it had transformed from a dominant, smothering aroma, to a MUCH more subtle, background scent.</li>
            <li> I use as a cologne and just started putting it in my daily facial moisturizer and combined six or so drops in my large bottle of hemp body moisturizer ....</li>
            <li> First time after opening the bottle you will regret not listening what other reviews say.</li>
            <li> However, there are other points in the overall purchase experience worth mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since a little goes a long way with this aroma, I look forward to enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Have been using scented oils for years and never had a bottle this size empty so fast.  </li>
            <li> From a heavy, earthy, yucky (to me) smell, and began to develop very surprisingly powerful lighter notes.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops but the scent stays with you and is a true patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick, dark patchouli essential oil that has the long-lasting quality I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously, SIGNIFICANTLY changed.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other Plant Essentials products and noticed normal fill variation, but always from full to over-full; never under-filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon receipt of this particular bottle, the four little plastic connector strands between the lower rim of the screw cap and the black plastic collar were snapped.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the essential oil extract is different from what they do with perfume - a big relief to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil was initially quite earthy smelling; I had applied a drop directly to my skin upon receiving the oil, and when I saw my mother a little while later, she quite definitively stated it transported her to a head shop she had frequented in 1971.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way, which is what I expect from my high quality essential</li>
            <li> It seems to soak deep into the skin (and maybe deeper?)as it only partially washed off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great as an insect repellent</li>
            <li> The fault of my disappointment is my remiss in not paying better attention to what I was buying.  </li>
            <li> One drop goes a long way ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it as I buy other essential oils for the oil burner for room fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Have used patchouli essential oil in combination with other oils to fragrance my home.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little different than I expected, but it works well for diffusing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and plan on buying the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> and it is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a long way, though!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;I will place other orders when it is over.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering other oils from this company as well.</li>
            <li> very small amount (especially in summer months) will go a VERY long</li>
            <li> Each is just a little different, compounded by the fact that they do change a little with time (use dark glass bottles)&lt;br</li>
            <li> others reviewers have complained about non-full bottles from other vendors, I will say two things: (1) as someone who has worked in chem labs, a level above the shoulder is considered full volume for the size stamped on the glass bottle&#x27;s bottom; (2) expect minor fill variation in production.  </li>
            <li> You rather love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aroma is inticing and of course it blends well with other oils as it should!  </li>
            <li> you hear &amp;#34;It smells like a Grateful Dead concert in here&amp;#34; from the other side of a Home Depot</li>
            <li> The smell was a little oily or mediciney, but after awhile just like it should be.</li>
            <li> Smelled awful; more like anise than patchouli!</li>
            <li> I use it at night wit a little bit of lavender.</li>
            <li> It has this green plant odor as if they used green patchouli for extracting the oil... something odd.</li>
            <li> I have allergy induced asthma and have been afraid to try some scents for this reason, but decided to see if this would work for me since it is advertised a pure.  </li>
            <li> I will not by my oil from any other company but Plant Therapy!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a playfulness in patchouli that is missing here.</li>
            <li> like this oil diluted in coconut oil as an after shower all over moisturizer, and heavily diluted in grapeseed oil as my face wash.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I would mix a few drops of oil with baby oil and put on face.</li>
            <li> I put just a few drops in my bath oil</li>
            <li> The stuff changed over a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The patchouli element in this oil is very slight.</li>
            <li> This was thick, not a very strong smell</li>
            <li> Other Plant Therapy Essential Oils (Frankincense &amp; Cedarwood  ) were bad also.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils, and it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Just take a sniff and if you hate it at first, put it aside for a couple of months and try again.</li>
            <li> But IF you hated it at first, KEEP IT!</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff at first.</li>
            <li> I really hated it at first.</li>
            <li> I HATED this stuff at first.</li>
            <li> as a skin cleaner (need to shake the mixing bottle vigorously before applying to a cotton ball), leaving the skin feeling refreshed with a subtle scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if it smells nasty at first, keep it!</li>
            <li> Not good Patchouli.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fair for me to rate it at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers quite long, I think it&#x27;s possibly a base note</li>
            <li> I know some people find this smell annoying at best and sickening at worst</li>
            <li> I base this on the strength of the scent compared to other vendors I have sampled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was initially skeptical about how Patchouli would smell after reading reviews that said it reminded them of &amp;#34;hippies&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;the &#x27;60s&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like stale moldy weed, probably the stinkiest oil I have smelled.</li>
            <li> I believe I was wrong on both counts.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit artificial, and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It did smell bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked to be revising this review.</li>
            <li> The oil smells awful to me though.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I think it smells awful.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this is the WORST smelling patchouli i ever encountered.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but it seemed to me as if I ran out very quickly.  Have been using scented oils for years and never had a bottle this size empty so fast.  The scent is wonderful, very strong and last a long time but you will need to buy more often.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the bottle i had a memory of being in my grandmother&#x27;s herb garden back in the Caribbean. The smell is pure and clean and smells exactly like the plant. I love adding it to my bath, I add a little to a kerchief for my handbags. I absolutely love it. This is what Patchouli should smell like.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not used to 100% pure patchouli but this stuff did not smell like patchouli to me. It smelt like patchouli&#x27;s brother, or something. There&#x27;s a playfulness in patchouli that is missing here. This stuff smells much earthier. I&#x27;ll find something to do with it but I won&#x27;t be wearing it!!!</li>
            <li> Just came in the mail today, almost a week early, and it is everything I expected it to be. The smell lingers quite long, I think it&#x27;s possibly a base note but I haven&#x27;t researched that part of it yet, but it smells soft, and woodsy; its strong but not overpowering either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Patchouli, and this essential oil has a perfect authentic fragrance.  This is quality oil; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The very iconic patchouli scent is in this bottle, it last a while and it smells like the original back in the 60s.</li>
            <li> I love this sent. It doesn&#x27;t lie when they state it is 100% pachouli oil. I use it everyday and plan on buying the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. My patients love when I wear this. A little goes a long ways. Refreshing, calming and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick, dark patchouli essential oil that has the long-lasting quality I&#x27;m looking for. A little goes a long, long way, which is what I expect from my high quality essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I like this oil diluted in coconut oil as an after shower all over moisturizer, and heavily diluted in grapeseed oil as my face wash.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as stated! It lifts the mood and smells wonderful. It smells so natural and I get a lot of compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> The heavy, musty aroma that I loved in the 60&#x27;s and I still love today. It was the scent of the hippie movement of the 60&#x27;s.It brings back such great memories. This Plant Therapy patchouli oil is excellent quality and aroma. Thanks Amazon for having this product. Les</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Oil is just as advertised.  Happy customer</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Loved the oil and am currently enjoying it in so many things.</li>
            <li> This is VERY watery. Smells good, but I dont think it is pure. Pure oil is supposed to drop out of the bottle, not pour.</li>
            <li> Stronger scent than I&#x27;m used to, but since I&#x27;m using it to make soap, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is by far my favorite scent. You rather love it or hate it. These plant therapy oils are very good and the smell lingers for days.</li>
            <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
            <li> This Patchouli Essential Oil is my fave.  Easy to dispense with the no waste spout inside.  I&#x27;ll buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole oils thing, so I don&#x27;t know if this is a quality oil or not. I really like this stuff though, when I first smelled it from the bottle it was very strong and didn&#x27;t smell too great. Poured a couple of drops in my bath, it smelled great. Then I smelled the lovely scent of Patchouli all day long on me, I still smell it now as I&#x27;m writing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the scent lasted over 24 hours, I&#x27;m going to say it is probably rather pure as described.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent!!! One drop goes a long way ... I use as a cologne and just started putting it in my daily facial moisturizer and combined six or so drops in my large bottle of hemp body moisturizer .... I like it!!!</li>
            <li> This Patchouli Oil has a fantastic fragrance. You can tell by the scent and consistency this is a very pure oil appropriate to use for (topical) therapeutic purposes. Would DEFINITELY order again!</li>
            <li> First time to smell this oil and I am looking forward to using it in my diffusers through this allergy season. I felt calm when I used under nose and this is something I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly in the diffuser. My favorite scent by far.</li>
            <li> The oil is of good quality hence the 3 stars. The oil smells awful to me though. I have no idea what I can do with it do to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great.  Totally fills my rooms with the great oil fragrance.  Lasting.  Not overly powerful, just pleasant. Thank you for this great essential oil.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other patchouli oils and had had so many complements, but none with this one.  In all honesty, I think it smells awful.  I love plant therapy. I have purchased lots of oils from them and have been quite pleased. They have excellent prices when compared to other companies and they&#x27;re quality is very good.</li>
            <li> This had a wonderful sent and was not the nasty patchouli you find now days! Very happy and will order again!</li>
            <li> First time after opening the bottle you will regret not listening what other reviews say. It is musky and more of a &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; type of patchouli aroma. It has this green plant odor as if they used green patchouli for extracting the oil... something odd. You&#x27;ll get used to that fairly soon to stop smelling....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But (the big but first), other people love me because of the room filling pleasant patchouli smell. My friends know when I am approaching and many foreign people think I am sorta of guru for chinese medicine or the like...mmmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo.... I am buying another bottle...he, he, he...</li>
            <li> I love this patchouli from Plant therapy!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it. The smell was a little oily or mediciney, but after awhile just like it should be.</li>
            <li> yup!!  I love it!!! It smells just like I remember.  I am using it daily, and after every shower!! Its great!!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest smelling patchouli essential oil.  Smells a bit artificial, and I am disappointed.  I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> Quick service.  I think it smells great. A LITTLE goes a long way, though!</li>
            <li> This was thick, not a very strong smell and I was okay with it, but not what I had expected. I have smelt and used better.</li>
            <li> Patchouli Essential Oil is not for everyone, but my husband really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Patchouli Essential Oil has an earthy, smoky, spicy, and musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as an insect repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli oil is considered to improve with age. This is why you can find many different colors and aroma profiles on the market. .</li>
            <li> Very powerful! A little goes a long way! The price was right and the quality exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> At the beginning the smell is strong but it will go away after a few minutes and after that you get the nice smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li> Use for insect bites, nothing works better, nothing!  Takes away pain on contact... and swelling!  I use a couple drops in my witch hazel, for cleansing face and refreshing underarms!</li>
            <li> This item came very quickly and was exactly as I expected. It does have a strong odor, but that is expected with this oil, anyone ordering should know that. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Vicks. It helped out a bit with my dry throat, mouth, and vocal cord, however if you are experiencing that issue,  grab cats claw and chia seeds first to really repair and hydrate your self and then use this product to help expand your range, and advance your healing progress.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I would mix a few drops of oil with baby oil and put on face. Acne started clearing up and skin tone was evening out.</li>
            <li> I ordered several varieties of oils from Plant Therapy.  They arrived on time, and as described.  I had been having oils compounded for me at a local store, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  The products that I received from plant therapy totally exceeded my expectations.  They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  I will definitely be using them for all my oil and aromatherapy purchases in the future.  Great service, great product!</li>
            <li> Great product - will order from again!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat of an essential oil connoisseur. I have over 250 quality oils collected since the &#x27;70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;K, now that we established I am a total nut....22 of them are various patchouli. Each is just a little different, compounded by the fact that they do change a little with time (use dark glass bottles)&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice oil, blooms well, mellows out well, lasts all day (or days)&lt;br /&gt;It blends beautifully with so many other oils.(a drop of black pepper with this is absolutely intoxicating)&lt;br /&gt;A very small amount (especially in summer months) will go a VERY long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you hear &amp;#34;It smells like a Grateful Dead concert in here&amp;#34; from the other side of a Home Depot..... You may have put a tad too much on!</li>
            <li> my husband put  it on cotton ball so his whole car smell like it he think it great  stuff this is Patchouli Essential oil</li>
            <li> Using iTis lieu of air freshener. A drop on a cool light bulb, turn light on and enjoy the aroma. This has a great &#x27;old school&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> I originally chose this item because I wanted an essential oil to use for aromatherapy for grounding. I read that any earthy scent is good for grounding; I chose this product frankly because I am on a tight budget and this was the only &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; essential oil I could find on Amazon that was for under $10 and qualified for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my Patchouli arrives and I open the bottle for a test smell. Yes, the very first thing you smell is the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent. I put one drop on a cotton ball and inhaled. At first the scent was neither good nor bad, just interesting... yet leaving me wanting more. After the earthy scent came damp fall leaves (inhale deeply and you also smell bark), then something a bit like suede and something musky (in a good way) that I couldn&#x27;t quite describe. It smelled similar to the Glade spray I recently bought called Cashmere Woods. HOWEVER, the Glade spray smells more like men&#x27;s cologne; the Patchouli definitely smells more feminine - a soft, gentle, perfume-y, &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; smell. I looked up cashmere and found a page for a perfume called Cashmere Mist. It is listed as smelling like musky, woody, powdery, amber, leather, vanilla. I would agree with the musky, woody, amber, and leather notes for this Patchouli. So I guess cashmere is the mystery scent I was smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is powerful; that one drop was all I needed. (Do not worry about the product pouring too fast out of the European-style dropper; when I turned over the open bottle, one drop came out only after I tapped the bottle a few times.) I eventually had to put the cotton ball away because the scent was so strong. This is where it gets good. The scent that lingered in the air afterward was just that &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; part of the scent; not the earthy part. Honestly, if I had to name the lingering scent of Patchouli, I would call it Autumn Fairy. That is the image this scent gives me: feminine; a soft, warm glow; a wood of amber-colored fallfoliage, and woodland creatures such as fawns, minks, and baby foxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially skeptical about how Patchouli would smell after reading reviews that said it reminded them of &amp;#34;hippies&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;the &#x27;60s&amp;#34;. Well, I wasn&#x27;t born in the &#x27;60s, so I wouldn&#x27;t know what that smelled liked, but this doesn&#x27;t make me think &amp;#34;hippies&amp;#34; at all. It&#x27;s just fantastic. This will definitely help me with grounding, leaving behind a perfect fall fragrance.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of oil from Plant Therapy, I have been very satisfied with all of them this was no exception.  It came very quickly and the smell is very strong and earthy, I love it.  I put just a few drops in my bath oil and it is very relaxing and therapeutic.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and using in several of my blends.</li>
            <li> Met granddaughter loves this!</li>
            <li> My guy likes patchouli, so for Valentines Day I thought it would be thoughtful to get some and experiment with it. I didn&#x27;t find a tolerable combination of delivery agent and oil mix. This essential oil has a strong smokey-woody-vegetable mold bouquet of odors. One reviewer said she had a strong negative reaction to this oil at first and liked it better after time passed (the scent oxidized, perhaps?). I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and have not yet tossed it out. But I don&#x27;t use it either. The patchouli element in this oil is very slight. On the plus side, the oil dissipates quickly and does not linger long on the skin. Patchouli fans, this oil is not likely to bring back fond memories of the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not good Patchouli. Other Plant Therapy Essential Oils (Frankincense &amp; Cedarwood  ) were bad also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been longing for the smell of Patchouli and this product popped up.  Nice smelling and reminds me of the old days.  LOL</li>
            <li> I bought patchouli oil from Peir 1 and it smelled yummy in my oil warmer.  This one has a very medicinal aroma.  Did not like it.</li>
            <li> Good size, good concentration. Delivered as expected. Can be combined with many other fragrances to form something unique for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like stale moldy weed, probably the stinkiest oil I have smelled. Other then that I love this oil. My husband has nerve damage in both of his legs and this oil, ginger root and coconut oil help him sleep when he rubs it on his legs. We are going to try it before he goes to work to see if that helps at work. I tell my hubby he smells like a hippy eating curry. I will not by my oil from any other company but Plant Therapy!!</li>
            <li> The price is right but I feel like i don&#x27;t love this brands fragrance oil as much as other patchoulis I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mixed with a wee bit of orange.  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent.  I have allergy induced asthma and have been afraid to try some scents for this reason, but decided to see if this would work for me since it is advertised a pure.  Patchouli is a wonderful smell that reminds me of growing up in the 70&#x27;s.  This product seems to me to be exactly as advertised.  I will order the same product again from the same seller.</li>
            <li> A chavacana friend in the Phillipines told me its the local remedy for arthritis.  I tried it and was surprised to find it helps relieve the pain and keep the joint in my neck from locking up.  Apparently the essential oil extract is different from what they do with perfume - a big relief to me.  I just use it at night and wash it off in the morning as best I can.  It seems to soak deep into the skin (and maybe deeper?)as it only partially washed off.</li>
            <li> This fragrant oil arrived securely wrapped and packaged for safety.  It&#x27;s aroma is inticing and of course it blends well with other oils as it should!  Lovely and earthy fragrance just right for many aromatherapy applications!</li>
            <li> High potency and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, concentrated grade.  I base this on the strength of the scent compared to other vendors I have sampled.  I am new to patchouli, so I will end the product content comparison there.  However, there are other points in the overall purchase experience worth mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others reviewers have complained about non-full bottles from other vendors, I will say two things: (1) as someone who has worked in chem labs, a level above the shoulder is considered full volume for the size stamped on the glass bottle&#x27;s bottom; (2) expect minor fill variation in production.  I have ordered other Plant Essentials products and noticed normal fill variation, but always from full to over-full; never under-filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon receipt of this particular bottle, the four little plastic connector strands between the lower rim of the screw cap and the black plastic collar were snapped.  I noted that there was no oil showing on the tip or rebated rim of the internal dropper, so while it did not appear to be used, I assumed that the bottle had been opened.  My assumption was incorrect.  A most pleasant encounter with the manufacturer&#x27;s Customer Service rep explained the how capping machine sometimes does this.  They offered to replace the bottle, but I was satisfied with the explanation.  I must say I was very impressed with my customer service interaction; that will certainly draw my repeat business with this merchant.</li>
            <li> smells lovely, good value</li>
            <li> The smell is very earthy and I love it.  A little goes a long way with this product.  I use it in my essential oil blends</li>
            <li> Good quality patchouli oil and smells great.  Used to make homemade lotion and smells great mixed with sandalwood and ginger.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It is exactly what I remember from long ago and I can&#x27;t imagine how the product could be any better.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, lasts all day. It has a nice rich earthy smell, but once on your body turns into a nice woodsy smell. It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived before the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;I will place other orders when it is over.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not as strong as I would like.</li>
            <li> At first I said \\&quot;yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables. But then I learned something. The stuff about patchouli improving with age is actually true. Of course, I had heard this, but I assumed 2 things: first, that it was a many months to years kind of thing, even if it was true, and second, that it was probably connoisseur subjective bs for the most part. I believe I was wrong on both counts. I hated this stuff at first. It did smell bad. Too earthy, too musky, and really, downright rotten. But I kept it around, just because I tend to do that. I smelled it a few weeks later, and it smelled better. I mixed it with other oils, and it wasn&#x27;t bad. Then, after a while, I decided to try it again on its own. I put it in my diffuser by itself. Smelled to good to just be the patchouli, so I figured it was mixing with some other oils that had residual smell in there. But then I took to smelling it from the bottle. The stuff had actually changed! I mean, seriously, SIGNIFICANTLY changed. I let it set for another week and smelled again. Even better. After a couple of more weeks, it was very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know some may ascribe this to me \\&quot;acquiring\\&quot; a taste for the smell. But I have to tell you, I did not expose myself to it enough for that to happen. I really hated it at first. It really did get a LOT better. And I can be specific about this. The stuff changed over a few weeks. From a heavy, earthy, yucky (to me) smell, and began to develop very surprisingly powerful lighter notes. (No, I&#x27;m not one of those bs&#x27;ers that normally talks about aromas in this way. For the record, all of my descriptions are just things I have no other way of describing more accurately.) The light notes became quite powerful, and had a distinctively citrus-like quality, but not exactly citrus, just very similar. Keep in mind, this is from smelling directly from the bottle, and/or, from smelling the oil directly from the bottle dropped onto my desk, my skin, etc. The smell had changed a lot. The musky, earthy aspect was still there, but now it had transformed from a dominant, smothering aroma, to a MUCH more subtle, background scent. In fact, it was now fairly pleasant in it&#x27;s own right, and did remind me of the (neuvo-80s) hippies I knew in college. The musky smell now provided a very nice, sort of bass note, a \\&quot;tethered-to-the-earth\\&quot; sensuality to deeply accent the wonderful, bright, higher notes that had emerged above it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked to be revising this review. I HATED this stuff at first. I&#x27;ll just say this: If you LOVE it at first, good for you. (You have a stronger and probably more sophisticated stomach/palate than I do.) But IF you hated it at first, KEEP IT! Or if you are debating about ordering it, ORDER IT. Just take a sniff and if you hate it at first, put it aside for a couple of months and try again. It really does change over time, and relatively quickly! It now smells VERY good to me. And as opposed to my prior version of this review, where I was totally committed to bashing it, I now say GO FOR IT! This stuff may be great at first for you, depending on your taste and, more importantly, on how old or fresh the oil you receive is. But if it smells nasty at first, keep it! This oil becomes extremely sophisticated and enjoyable in an almost ineffable way within a few weeks. It&#x27;s very good stuff. I apologize to the provider for bashing. Had no idea the stuff would turn out this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in case anyone is wondering. (Which I really doubt.) I AM the guy whose original title said simply \\&quot;Yuck\\&quot;, and compared it to rotting vegetables. This is that review, only revised now. Good stuff man. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because I cannot rate it and it is not what I expected.  That is my fault.  I should have taken note that it is &amp;#34;therapeutic grade.&amp;#34;  Also &amp;#34;plant therapy&amp;#34; should have also clued me.  I bought it as I buy other essential oils for the oil burner for room fragrance.  And patchouli is one of my favorites.  This patchouli oil has a medicinal smell.  It is used to combat nervous disorders, dandruff, sores, skin irritations and acne.  Reading the tiny print on the label it goes on . . .  used as an anti-flammatory, anti-emetic, antimicrobal, antiphlogistic, antiseptic, antibiotic, astringent, diuretic, deodorant, fungicidal, tonic agent and I missed some others in between.  The fault of my disappointment is my remiss in not paying better attention to what I was buying.  It&#x27;s not fair for me to rate it at all.  For all I know, it should be rated 5 stars for what it is intended as a plant therapy.  If one can judge quality of a company by its packaging, the label and bottle would get it 5 stars.  Who knows?  I might have found something I like when I find some use for it since I am into homeopathic or natural remedies and alternative medicine.</li>
            <li> I use 15 drops of this Patchouli oil directly mixed with about 1 oz of [[ASIN:B004TH71W0 Witch Hazel Distillate (Alcohol Free) 8 Ounces]] as a skin cleaner (need to shake the mixing bottle vigorously before applying to a cotton ball), leaving the skin feeling refreshed with a subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil was initially quite earthy smelling; I had applied a drop directly to my skin upon receiving the oil, and when I saw my mother a little while later, she quite definitively stated it transported her to a head shop she had frequented in 1971. Now after three weeks (I purposely waited before reviewing), I have already noticed a sweeter overtone when smelling the bottle. Perhaps having the acid in your skin coming into contact with the bottle contents right away is the catalyst for the change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a few times as a body scent, but yes, I primarily use it as a combination element with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Smelled awful; more like anise than patchouli! I tried to &#x27;let it air&#x27;, but that didn&#x27;t help. I know I love the patchouli scent, but after this am wondering if what I am used to isn&#x27;t &#x27;real&#x27;. I&#x27;m going to try again with NOW ptchouli oil...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is a wonderful company and a great product, I buy from them often.  The tranquility is actually my favorite, but I add a bit of this and it is just right!</li>
            <li> Nice quality. I&#x27;ve been using it to make room sprays.</li>
            <li> 100% pure therapeutic grade is what I was looking for, high quality and contaminant free are important to me when I am putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used patchouli essential oil in combination with other oils to fragrance my home.  I am very pleased with it.  Don&#x27;t need much.  Would definitely purchase it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I know some people find this smell annoying at best and sickening at worst but I love it. Patchouli ages well and packaging is important to to aging it well. This is a good fresh patchouli in a well sealed bottle. Since a little goes a long way with this aroma, I look forward to enjoying this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have been along time user of patchouli and it seems more and more hard to find.  this sent is not even close to what it should smell like.  I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it wasn&#x27;t as sweet smelling as I expected.  I do believe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to cheap patchouli oil.  This stuff seems really high quality, however, and I am generally happy with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Got it very quickly.  I&#x27;ve wanted this for a long time. Would buy from this seller in a hot New York minute.</li>
            <li> Smells a little different than I expected, but it works well for diffusing. I use it at night wit a little bit of lavender.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap and great value - thank you</li>
            <li> great product - as advertised - received when promised</li>
            <li> The Patchouli Essential Oil is quite expensive but it is my favorite of the oils. You can tell this produce is more concentrated than most which makes it easier to deal with the price. A little goes a long way. I love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> The oil smells very nice and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  I will definitely order again. Also, the seller contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  That is the first time a seller on Amzaon has done that.  Great service!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the strong scent that lasts all day. You only need a few drops but the scent stays with you and is a true patchouli scent. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer the sensual blend but would buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Yup, same product as before(2nd time ordering it)  -- smells better than those I&#x27;ve smelled in boutiques. . . though, it may have a certain under-note that I&#x27;ve only identified as &amp;#34;tonic-y&amp;#34; ??  ~ I could bring it into a specialty shop &amp; ask their opinion ~  but it only cost about $8, free shipping, &amp; it does the job!  luv it!  :)</li>
            <li> Been using this oil for several years, this one was a reasonable price and a good quality.Really love ‚ù§ it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the WORST smelling patchouli i ever encountered. I got refunded and returned it after just 2 uses. I think this company should stop making oils because they haven&#x27;t got a clue about what patchouli is supposed to smell like and it sure doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; at all. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Love Patchouli and this brand is GREAT</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this oil. It was reasonable and doesn&#x27;t have additives which was exactly what I was looking for. I was also happy about how the product was packaged. I will be ordering other oils from this company as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you!  It&#x27;s perfect. Not too strong and perfect. Mixed some with Eucalyptus oil and that&#x27;s great too. Have had many friends comment and borrow.</li>
            <li> GREAT OLD ORIGINAL 60&#x27;S SMELL</li>
            <li> Love getting new oils!!! No exception here!! Always know I will get the best from Plant Therapy!!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells great all day long and into the night. I love it! Will buy again when this is gone. I am going to add it to my homemade laundry detergent to scent it as well.</li>
