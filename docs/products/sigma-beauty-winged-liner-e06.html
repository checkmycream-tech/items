            <li>I do love the sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I am planning in buying more to add to my sigma collection.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush for winged liner -</li>
            <li>, I can draw a lovely wing easily with this.  </li>
            <li>I think the winged liner brush is fabulous and precise!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this brush was made by God himself!</li>
            <li>THE HYPE ABOUT THIS BRUSH IS TRUE!</li>
            <li>but when I tried it I was literally floored at how easy it was to wing my liner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>I use Inglot 77 which is hands down the best also.</li>
            <li>The shipment was delivered quickly and I really enjoyed using it..</li>
            <li>This little brush is awesome.</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>True to its name</li>
            <li>eyeliner brush is ONLY good for doing the wing.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a really long time for the perfect winged eyeliner brush and have finally found it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the brush is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite go to liner brush.</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;ve wasted over $100 in different eyeliner brushes trying to find one that gave me the perfect winged liner all the time.  </li>
            <li>The only brush that makes it easy to do an eye wing.</li>
            <li>THE HAIRS HAVE JUST ENOUGH RIGIDITY TO MAKE A SLEEK STRAIGHT PRECISE LINE AND ARE SOFT ENOUGH TO DRAG FROM THE WING WITHOUT SKIPPING, CREATING A PERFECT PROFESSIONAL LOOK!</li>
            <li>Also this is a real sigma brush.</li>
            <li>An absolute must for your brush collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with a liquid liner on several clients and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it really had no advantage over brands like bhcosmetis or bdellium.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so tiny and precise</li>
            <li>It appears to be well-made and looks like it&#x27;ll last me many years with proper care.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The packaging and everything was exact and it came from the actual sigma location.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m no makeup artist but had no trouble with using this brush.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This feels like cheap plastic and the bristles were uneven.</li>
            <li>Its small and precise.</li>
            <li>I found it extremely difficult to actually line the rest of my eye with this brush which is kind of ironic since I really only line the outer corner.</li>
            <li>I thought it was gonna be too small to make quick lines with gel eyeliner</li>

            <li> It is really long and floppy</li>
            <li> You can get such detail when using it, the possibilities are endless.</li>

            <li> I was a little hesitant about it</li>
            <li> and the bristles are stiff!</li>
            <li> not good for gel/cream eyeliner</li>
            <li> I can draw a thin line if I hold the brush horizontal to the lash line, or a medium thick line if I hold it at a 45 degree angle.  </li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>

            <li> The bristles are rougher than I expected. So, you have to use it carefully.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I am glad that I purchased it. The only thing that I would say is that when I received the item it did not come in its package. It was stuck to the tape that was used to seal the box.</li>
            <li> This little brush is awesome. You can get the finest of lines,  anywhere! A must for winged liner</li>
            <li> Great brush for winging out eye liner.  Works well with both gel and cake eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this brush was made by God himself! I have never had such a perfect brush for eyeliner! I use it for Mac gel eyeliner and I totally prefer this brush to theirs. This brush makes the most perfect wing and slim lines! I&#x27;m in love with it!!!😻😻</li>
            <li> Love this! Tried many brushes and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it! Works like a charm for my winged liner!! :)</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about it but when I tried it I was literally floored at how easy it was to wing my liner. I thought it was gonna be too small to make quick lines with gel eyeliner but I was so wrong. It&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> Worked great. The only brush that makes it easy to do an eye wing. Love this brush. Its small and precise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t think the brush is worth the price. It definitely is over priced. Also this is a real sigma brush. The packaging and everything was exact and it came from the actual sigma location.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush everyone needs! If you ever have a hard time doing winged liner or wanted to get a super thin line close to your lash line, this brush is everything you could ever want. It is by far my favorite go to liner brush. You can get such detail when using it, the possibilities are endless. The brush is so tiny that it makes it hard to mess up.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a really long time for the perfect winged eyeliner brush and have finally found it. This is not exaggeration. This brush is just so amazing. I think I read someone say that this brush doesn&#x27;t fill in the wing but it does. It may be her choice of eyeliner. I use Inglot 77 which is hands down the best also. But this brush is a must have if winged eyeliner is apart of your daily routine. I highly recommend. And I&#x27;m no makeup artist but had no trouble with using this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for beginners, since it makes it so much easier to apply a winged liner.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner brush ever !! Everyone should get it.. The shipment was delivered quickly and I really enjoyed using it..</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. This feels like cheap plastic and the bristles were uneven.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I am able to make the perfect winged liner.  I swear I&#x27;ve wasted over $100 in different eyeliner brushes trying to find one that gave me the perfect winged liner all the time.  I FINALLY found THE ONE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m great at winged liner, however, this brush takes it to another level.  It&#x27;s easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Really  nice !!!! A most !!</li>
            <li> If you are a winged liner junkie like me, you NEED this brush in your life.  Easiest way to get the perfect, cleanest and most precise line.  An absolute must for your brush collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I purchased this for my pro kit.  I&#x27;ve used it with a liquid liner on several clients and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I can draw a thin line if I hold the brush horizontal to the lash line, or a medium thick line if I hold it at a 45 degree angle.  True to its name, I can draw a lovely wing easily with this.  It appears to be well-made and looks like it&#x27;ll last me many years with proper care.  This brush is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I do love the sigma brushes. They are in fact, the best brushes on the market. I am planning in buying more to add to my sigma collection. The winged liner brush is very good, however, I sometimes find myself reaching for my pen in a hurry to do my wings. I think the winged liner brush is fabulous and precise!</li>
            <li> THE HYPE ABOUT THIS BRUSH IS TRUE! THE HAIRS HAVE JUST ENOUGH RIGIDITY TO MAKE A SLEEK STRAIGHT PRECISE LINE AND ARE SOFT ENOUGH TO DRAG FROM THE WING WITHOUT SKIPPING, CREATING A PERFECT PROFESSIONAL LOOK! I HAVE REVIEWED SEVERAL BRANDS OF ANGLED BRUSHES. THIS IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li> not good for gel/cream eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;this eyeliner brush is ONLY good for doing the wing. I found it extremely difficult to actually line the rest of my eye with this brush which is kind of ironic since I really only line the outer corner. It is really long and floppy so when you glide along your lash line you cannot apply enough pressure for a cream eyeliner to actually apply in any sort of pigmented matter because the brush will just bend instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;now that sigma prices have gone up it really had no advantage over brands like bhcosmetis or bdellium.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend hakuhodo J007S for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are excellent, and this is no exception</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush for winged liner - it&#x27;s so tiny and precise and the bristles are stiff!</li>
