            <li>money great job great</li>
            <li>We just love the scent of Madanna&#x27;s Truth or Dare Parfum!!</li>
            <li>I had smelled this at a dept store and loved it.</li>
            <li>Received a sample in the store and loved it</li>
            <li>She laughed because it was close to her when she sprayed Madonna on and that I could still smell it on the shirt.  </li>
            <li>I am going to have to sample this scent separately within the walls of each four distinct annual seasons and see which if not all work best with it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so pleased this didn&#x27;t happen!</li>
            <li>Whatever they put in this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The Truth is: This perfume smells nice.</li>
            <li>&amp; she liked it, then I promised her that I was going to buy it for her one day</li>
            <li>And I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A Tank Top my niece gave me smelled so good that I had to ask her what the name of the perfume was.  </li>
            <li>In itself, this is an exceptional, refined, elegant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I carpet cleaned the interior from time to time but a 6 year old car just doesn&#x27;t smell that great no matter what; until I sprayed this perfume inside the car!  </li>
            <li>I would say it has a lot more similarities to Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Diamond &amp; Emeralds which I also own &amp; have reviewed.</li>
            <li>This is a amazing, sexy scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is STRONG!  </li>
            <li>It smells great from the first spray until the end.</li>
            <li>My husband bought it for me &amp; most perfumes give him a headache, but not this one.</li>
            <li>but when it came for the price this is the most prettist parfum&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>My mother love them.</li>
            <li>: Sand, sun, beaches &amp; the tropics still come to mind which is just a total mind screw but utterly delightful to the nose.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot. :)</li>
            <li>I love it when a perfume does this on my skin.</li>
            <li>, I would have thought it was a much more expensive/exclusive fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and also she always researches what is in the perfume she wears</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, flowery, almost like a jasmine type smell, and is not too storng, but plenty strong enough to notice.</li>
            <li>Its nice and light and its not to strong.</li>
            <li>The undertone is a nice mild  vanilla</li>
            <li>There is more lovely, sweet amber with a flower hint.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>love this smell, and this perfume is so unique and smells well</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful perfume.</li>
            <li>This is defiantly not the sugary, candy sweet smell of most celebrity perfumes.</li>
            <li>Just remember to go LIGHT with this fragrance because it can be overpowering if you put on too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A really nice, high quality perfume!</li>
            <li>At first i wasnt sure</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit generic and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;, good for the cheap price but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>First of all, I just really love the white glass bottle, a bit untraditional but very lovely.</li>
            <li>This is by far the cheapest perfume I own</li>
            <li>Thanks MaDonna!!</li>
            <li>No having to get past weird,funky smells before it starts smelling good!</li>
            <li>If you like that, you will probably enjoy this very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The projection and silage are amazing for such an inexpensive perfume.</li>
            <li>This perfume stands solidly on its own.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong in enclose area; i.e. car so don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>This is so much more complex and so much more wearer friendly, on my skin.</li>
            <li>What readily makes the fragrance stand out though is the bold fragrance of tuberose and gardenia.  </li>
            <li>it looks and feels very modern</li>
            <li>Smell is very sensual indeed!</li>
            <li>The tuberose, gardenia,and lily are the three notes that dominate on me at first.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried the tuberose,lily and musk would create a cigarette and perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to wear than Fracas but shares many of the same characteristics.  </li>
            <li>I not only will buy more, but I would recommend this to anyone who asks.  </li>
            <li>I had the SUV for 6 years and after many trips to the beach and many more to the local home supply store for landscaping supplies, it was smelling a bit stale.  </li>
            <li>I suggest going to dept store if you can and smell a bunch and then buy here as it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It tells me that it really does suit my skin chemistry.</li>
            <li>All I do know is that my nose and skin seem to real like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much musk</li>
            <li>This is an elagant and understated scent that harkens back to the 1930&#x27;s but is relevant to today.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>But are quickly tamed within the first ten minutes by the benzoin,musk,amber and vanilla.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the original fragrance that I got - it was &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; - and it was a gift for someone who requested the original, so not entirely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pretty white floral scent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not one for the teeny boppers; this is a modern adult woman&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is like a very complicated wine which I am sure I love but have a strong desire to try to pick apart and compartmentalize each note so that I can understand the blend and how the designer came up with such a seamless &amp; quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the bottle more than the perfume itself, scent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>Now that my new Volt has that new car smell, I spray this in my office and everyone loves the scent.</li>
            <li>My new perfume for now&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is classy without the high price point.</li>
            <li>have owned Fracas and personally don&#x27;t see much similarity to the two whatsoever.</li>
            <li>But then maybe my nose,and stomach can&#x27;t handle real quality white florals,lol!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowery \\&quot;old woman\\&quot; fragrance</li>
            <li>to that my nose is picking up a sweet background note which is not unlike taking a deep whiff of a Pez dispenser &amp; inhaling orange cream, lemon &amp; icy lime flavored candies.</li>
            <li>I need to forewarn you that you must really like/love big white florals.</li>
            <li>It is very similar to Fracas which is probably one of my long term go to perfumes, but maybe it is even a little better to me?  </li>
            <li>A forced potted narcissus in front of a crackling fire on a cool spring night seems to be the clearest picture I could &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; of this scent for someone.</li>
            <li>how this conglomeration of scents is grounded well with a musky, ambergris quality which is the backbone to the whole mess of scent coming forward, and it works.&lt;br</li>

            <li> A few months latter I decided to get a new car</li>
            <li> Very floral but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> love the way this conjures up images of greenhouses, damp earth, cold walks in London on a rainy day, wet rubber tires, dew dripping off of white flowers AND warmth at the same time</li>
            <li> it almost reminds me of baby wipes or even the damp silica gel inside of a wet baby diaper/nappy, and oddly enough, I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously</li>
            <li> but then the Tuberose kicks it up to WOMAN; it&#x27;s like a good, bad girl - HA!  </li>
            <li> Has little lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Think Fracas light, but not in a bad way at all.</li>
            <li> One or two little sprays are plenty &amp; it lasts all day on me.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I did not spill my little secret.</li>
            <li> felt like someone came up and slapped me in the nose with a fistful of wet, damp, dirty gardenias.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s barely there on the base notes.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smell is very sensual indeed!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful perfume. My husband bought it for me &amp; most perfumes give him a headache, but not this one. It has a wonderful, flowery, almost like a jasmine type smell, and is not too storng, but plenty strong enough to notice. I wear it all day &amp; also going to bed at night~ it&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
            <li> In itself, this is an exceptional, refined, elegant fragrance.  If you are a woman with class, this would be your signature scent.  However, since I am a guy, I bought this perfume to be an air freshener in my SUV.  I had the SUV for 6 years and after many trips to the beach and many more to the local home supply store for landscaping supplies, it was smelling a bit stale.  I carpet cleaned the interior from time to time but a 6 year old car just doesn&#x27;t smell that great no matter what; until I sprayed this perfume inside the car!  A few months latter I decided to get a new car and when I took the SUV in for the appraisal everyone was impressed by the scent.  Of course, I did not spill my little secret. Now that my new Volt has that new car smell, I spray this in my office and everyone loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I like the bottle more than the perfume itself, scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and it&#x27;s a bit generic and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;, good for the cheap price but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Btw it does smell uni-sex.</li>
            <li> Has little lasting scent. Smells like a dollar store cologne.</li>
            <li> We just love the scent of Madanna&#x27;s Truth or Dare Parfum!! The Truth is: This perfume smells nice. Its nice and light and its not to strong.Thanks MaDonna!!</li>
            <li> smells very good. it looks and feels very modern, i got it for my niece and she likes it a lot.!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the original fragrance that I got - it was &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; - and it was a gift for someone who requested the original, so not entirely satisfied. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li> At first i wasnt sure but when it came for the price this is the most prettist parfum&lt;br /&gt;at this cost i have ever smelled&lt;br /&gt;it stayed on me al day&lt;br /&gt;Im buying another today and my parfums&lt;br /&gt;cost money great job great parfum&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping in 2 days&lt;br /&gt;great job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Received a sample in the store and loved it but when I bought the bottle it smelled different.  It might of been me I don&#x27;t know but I gave this to my niece because I just didn&#x27;t care for the way it smelled on me.</li>
            <li> First of all, I just really love the white glass bottle, a bit untraditional but very lovely. What readily makes the fragrance stand out though is the bold fragrance of tuberose and gardenia.  This is defiantly not the sugary, candy sweet smell of most celebrity perfumes. Think Fracas light, but not in a bad way at all. This perfume stands solidly on its own. The undertone is a nice mild  vanilla</li>
            <li> Cristian Iniestra,&lt;br /&gt;Well, one day my mom &amp; I went to the mall &amp; my mother smelled this perfume &amp; she liked it, then I promised her that I was going to buy it for her one day &amp; I did, I got 2 of these for her. My mother love them. The smell is very fresh, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty white floral scent. If you appreciate gardenias, tuberose &amp; jasmine based scents that are grounded by the warmth of the scent of vanilla, you will probably like this. For reference, this is similar in feel to Robert Piquet&#x27;s Fracas perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!&lt;br /&gt;After applying and giving it about two minutes to settle ( I only sprayed once)I felt like someone came up and slapped me in the nose with a fistful of wet, damp, dirty gardenias. And I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;After about 20 minutes I experience a powdery smell...it almost reminds me of baby wipes or even the damp silica gel inside of a wet baby diaper/nappy, and oddly enough, I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously to that my nose is picking up a sweet background note which is not unlike taking a deep whiff of a Pez dispenser &amp; inhaling orange cream, lemon &amp; icy lime flavored candies. I like that too!&lt;br /&gt;Some how this conglomeration of scents is grounded well with a musky, ambergris quality which is the backbone to the whole mess of scent coming forward, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;It is like a very complicated wine which I am sure I love but have a strong desire to try to pick apart and compartmentalize each note so that I can understand the blend and how the designer came up with such a seamless &amp; quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned Fracas and personally don&#x27;t see much similarity to the two whatsoever. Fracas is hardcore linear tuberose. This is so much more complex and so much more wearer friendly, on my skin. I would say it has a lot more similarities to Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Diamond &amp; Emeralds which I also own &amp; have reviewed. If you like that, you will probably enjoy this very much.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this conjures up images of greenhouses, damp earth, cold walks in London on a rainy day, wet rubber tires, dew dripping off of white flowers AND warmth at the same time: Sand, sun, beaches &amp; the tropics still come to mind which is just a total mind screw but utterly delightful to the nose. A forced potted narcissus in front of a crackling fire on a cool spring night seems to be the clearest picture I could &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; of this scent for someone. I am going to have to sample this scent separately within the walls of each four distinct annual seasons and see which if not all work best with it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I like it a lot. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Truth or Dare is beautiful. It smells great from the first spray until the end. I love it when a perfume does this on my skin. It tells me that it really does suit my skin chemistry. No having to get past weird,funky smells before it starts smelling good! I need to forewarn you that you must really like/love big white florals. Because that&#x27;s what this perfume is all about in the beginning. The tuberose, gardenia,and lily are the three notes that dominate on me at first. But are quickly tamed within the first ten minutes by the benzoin,musk,amber and vanilla. So no time for me to get a headache,or feel any nausea from the white florals. At first I was worried the tuberose,lily and musk would create a cigarette and perfume smell. Which sometimes happens to me,when these notes are in a perfume. I am so pleased this didn&#x27;t happen! The projection and silage are amazing for such an inexpensive perfume. I also don&#x27;t feel it smells synthetic at all. But then maybe my nose,and stomach can&#x27;t handle real quality white florals,lol! I don&#x27;t know?! All I do know is that my nose and skin seem to real like this fragrance. I put Madonna&#x27;s Truth or Dare in the same category as Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s White Diamonds. A classic,timeless perfume. That is classy without the high price point.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing, sexy scent. It can be worn day or night! It can turn a so-so day into smiles.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong in enclose area; i.e. car so don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this scent.  I have never bought a celebrity fragrance but this was recommended to me because I like the fragrance \\&quot;Fracas\\&quot; (this is NOT a duplicate/knockoff of Fracas). If I didn&#x27;t know this was a \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrance, I would have thought it was a much more expensive/exclusive fragrance.  It&#x27;s easier to wear than Fracas but shares many of the same characteristics.  It also reminds me of that 1980&#x27;s Coty cologne \\&quot;Sand and Sable\\&quot;; it must be the gardenia, jasmine, white flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens BIG with Tuberose, Gardenia, Jasmine &amp; then Vanilla &amp; Orange Flower, hints of Creamy Caramel, Amber, Lily &amp; Cedar.  If you are not in to white flower scents, you will not like this fragrance.  I don&#x27;t really notice much musk but I think it&#x27;s barely there on the base notes.  There is more lovely, sweet amber with a flower hint.  It doesn&#x27;t  go stinky/dirty on me in the dry-down so I still like it at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is STRONG!  One or two little sprays are plenty &amp; it lasts all day on me.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowery \\&quot;old woman\\&quot; fragrance but it&#x27;s not one for the teeny boppers; this is a modern adult woman&#x27;s fragrance.  The Gardenia flower says girly girl scent to me but then the Tuberose kicks it up to WOMAN; it&#x27;s like a good, bad girl - HA!  Just remember to go LIGHT with this fragrance because it can be overpowering if you put on too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  My bottle was Sold By: Amazon.com, LLC  Shipped By: Amazon.com, LLC</li>
            <li> A Tank Top my niece gave me smelled so good that I had to ask her what the name of the perfume was.  She laughed because it was close to her when she sprayed Madonna on and that I could still smell it on the shirt.  Love the smell and also she always researches what is in the perfume she wears so I knew I would like it! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased and received the perfume.  I took a shower in the morning and put it on. This perfume lasted me until the next morning.  I not only will buy more, but I would recommend this to anyone who asks.  I was amazed.  There are perfumes out there that are even more expensive and don&#x27;t even last that long.  Whatever they put in this stuff is amazing.  This is the best perfume out there; and, it smells good to.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!! And i can&#x27;t believe what a deal it was!!</li>
            <li> My new perfume for now&lt;br /&gt;I love this smell, and this perfume is so unique and smells well</li>
            <li> This is by far the cheapest perfume I own and I have to say that it is one of my favorites!  It is very similar to Fracas which is probably one of my long term go to perfumes, but maybe it is even a little better to me?  A really nice, high quality perfume!</li>
            <li> This is an elagant and understated scent that harkens back to the 1930&#x27;s but is relevant to today.  Very floral but not overwhelming.  As with any scent, test it locally before you buy it</li>
