            <li>You guys better buy this</li>

            <li>I have had moderate/severe acne for most of my life since I hit puberty, and I&#x27;m now 25.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li>So with their creative wording they tricked you.</li>
            <li>I took it several years ago and enjoyed flawless skin for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t see more improvement I&#x27;m going to stop using it.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin appears to have more moisture in it now than before I began using the product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, purchase this kit, I do believe you will be pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure and go online to [...] to register for the $5.00 off coupon at time of purhcase.    </li>
            <li>It took a while to get results (2-3 weeks) but it did get significantly better after that.</li>
            <li>One happy clean &amp; clear customer!!!!!</li>
            <li>But for everyone saying that \\&quot;100% of people had results within 24 hours\\&quot; is a lie, Just read ther fine print.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and highly reccommend it.ut it on at any time.   </li>
            <li>and i got a bunch of huge zits everywhere.</li>
            <li>but it hasnt made a huge difference either.</li>
            <li>Great daily routine even when you don&#x27;t have breakouts.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I picked this up about two months ago, after reading many good reviews from people who say it&#x27;s the \\&quot;only thing that works for them\\&quot; and that they had already tried medication and proactive.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li>If you have acne similar to mine, USE THIS, and don&#x27;t think its too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face like most products.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly I saw results.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product and highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting married soon and want to look radiant, not pimply!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to see that there is a kit available for only around $8.00, which I am sure can only add to the product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>have tried ProActiv, which worked great, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for me.</li>
            <li>Effective in reducing breakouts when used as a regular regimen.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use old towels and pillowcases.</li>
            <li>It was soft and smooth and felt clean.  </li>
            <li>My problem area is right around my mouth along the path of hair follicles.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled w/finding the right moisturizer to use that</li>
            <li>Thank you clean and clear!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be finding out very soon!</li>
            <li>and I have tried everything from Proactive, to Natural Soaps and Products, the dermatologist, Acne Free, The Body Shop&#x27;s line for acne, and nothing has worked so</li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that for other items and those that even cost more!</li>
            <li>It also bleaches your towels so make sure you are using a white towel.</li>
            <li>But of course, every person is different in their needs, so use this product as you see fit!  </li>
            <li>exactly* as the directions dictated, all three steps, in the morning and before bed.  </li>
            <li>Truly within the first two days I saw amazing results, and by the end of the week I pretty much had my face back to normal!  </li>
            <li>However, I tried the Clean &amp; Clear Spot Treatment for a couple weeks before my sister&#x27;s wedding, and it worked miracles!</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure my skin will clear up completely in one month.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time this morning, and woooow, my face is so soft right now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Clean &amp; Clear Advantage kit once before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been Using Clean &amp; Clear for a week now.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a great alternative to other systems like Proactive which use a liquid toner as the second step.</li>
            <li>I have mostly oily skin, but dry flakiness around my nose and sometimes on my forehead.</li>
            <li>But hopefully my mild ance might clear up soon.</li>
            <li>This Really Works.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>the ones i got the kit for hasnt really improved.</li>
            <li>so very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I wasn&#x27;t using the whole kit, I always have the spot treatment on hand.</li>
            <li>and I only have a few traces of acne left, which is very impressive!   </li>
            <li>Really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>There was slight dryness near the sensitive parts of my eyes, but I&#x27;m sure if you use it a little more sparingly over a longer period of time, you will be fine!</li>
            <li>I am 23, so I very rarely get any raging red zits/pimples anymore.</li>
            <li>a lot more than ever before on any other product</li>
            <li>--that&#x27;s the only thing that has ever made a significant difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>After spending $60.+ on my first ProActive kit and using it for over two weeks with no results, just new blemishes, I decided to look into the Clean &amp; Clear control kit after seeing a commercial.  </li>
            <li>Some people would give up smooth, hydrated skin for flaky, dry, but acne-free skin.</li>
            <li>I will deal with the occasional zit and spare myself the lovely shade of red I&#x27;ve become.</li>
            <li>I used the cleanser and the moisturizer and put the spot treatment on the several large pimples that I have right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or it could change in color and size and get larger and more red.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying the kit I bought the C&amp;C Continuous Control Acne Cleanser wich has ten % benzoyl peroxide just like the cleanser in the kit, also the C&amp;C oil free dual action moisturizer with 0.5 &amp; of salicylic acid just like the one in the kit also, and their advantage acne spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I still breakout there regularly even though I&#x27;ve been using Clean and Clear.</li>
            <li>This product would probably be a bit much for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I thought about trying it again, but having dried up skin isn&#x27;t better than having acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because you might feel your skin dry but to the touch it feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I figured I was just getting used to a new product and decided not to use it that night.  </li>
            <li>--I think it&#x27;s just because I like trying new products).</li>
            <li>And each morning I was waking up to a new pimple.  </li>
            <li>That definitely clears up big problem zits quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve used and much quicker than they would go away on their own.</li>
            <li>I still have a few pores but my chin area has become smooth, before it was very bumpy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s clear!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used an acne product and my skin ACTUALLY felt</li>
            <li>Spare yourself the horror and just throw your money directly in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get rid of some blemishes because I was going to a trip to meet up with some old friends I have not seen in years.</li>
            <li>I like the cleanser because it left my skin feeling really refreshed.</li>
            <li>So much so, that when I look in the mirror in the morning (a PMS morning, no less), I actually think</li>
            <li>This product seemed to be working at first, it does really dry out the blemishes..</li>
            <li>The only difference is they are not as large and as red as they were.</li>
            <li>Just the first two steps alone was enough to dry out my face and clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>Since then, the zits have been creeping back in, and nothing has helped much (prescription topical things, antibiotics, hormone treatments).  </li>
            <li>Plus, this ingredient dries my skin out like no other.    </li>
            <li>I stopped using this immediately after I got the major breakout and threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li>You are actually supposed to use less and only on the actual problem area, but I figured an overload for a special occasion couldn&#x27;t hurt--and it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe my acne wasn&#x27;t severe enough for this, or maybe my skin is too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I finally got results about 72 hours later, when my skin started breaking out and NEW pimples started forming.  </li>
            <li>I can buy this when I&#x27;m ready, when I need it and can afford it, instead of being charged monthly and having it mailed to me like some other treatments.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I gave it a four because you might feel your skin dry but to the touch it feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I figured I was just getting used to a new product and decided not to use it that night.  </li>
            <li> --I think it&#x27;s just because I like trying new products).</li>
            <li> And each morning I was waking up to a new pimple.  </li>
            <li> That definitely clears up big problem zits quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve used and much quicker than they would go away on their own.</li>
            <li> I still have a few pores but my chin area has become smooth, before it was very bumpy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s clear!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an acne product and my skin ACTUALLY felt</li>
            <li> Spare yourself the horror and just throw your money directly in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get rid of some blemishes because I was going to a trip to meet up with some old friends I have not seen in years.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser because it left my skin feeling really refreshed.</li>
            <li> So much so, that when I look in the mirror in the morning (a PMS morning, no less), I actually think</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be working at first, it does really dry out the blemishes..</li>
            <li> The only difference is they are not as large and as red as they were.</li>
            <li> Just the first two steps alone was enough to dry out my face and clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since then, the zits have been creeping back in, and nothing has helped much (prescription topical things, antibiotics, hormone treatments).  </li>
            <li> Plus, this ingredient dries my skin out like no other.    </li>
            <li> I stopped using this immediately after I got the major breakout and threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> You are actually supposed to use less and only on the actual problem area, but I figured an overload for a special occasion couldn&#x27;t hurt--and it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my acne wasn&#x27;t severe enough for this, or maybe my skin is too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I finally got results about 72 hours later, when my skin started breaking out and NEW pimples started forming.  </li>
            <li> I can buy this when I&#x27;m ready, when I need it and can afford it, instead of being charged monthly and having it mailed to me like some other treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There wouldn&#x27;t be a day I didn&#x27;t have at least one pimple, and usually I had more like clusters.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer component is key, as this definitely will dry you out (and let me say that NOTHING dries out my skin!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed heavy duty moisturizer for over a week to make my skin normal again.</li>
            <li> Finally, the spot treatment worked well but stung a little on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really thought when I bought this kit 3 weeks ago it would be a scam like most other products, especially since it has the usual ingredients that I&#x27;ve tried before and failed with.  </li>
            <li> so far it has cleared up those little bumps i had on my forehead but</li>
            <li> but the product might be a little old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to work</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old, and for a few years I have been getting acne around the jawline, cheeks and hairline.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was less than pleased.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps my extremely oily skin under control.</li>
            <li> Does over dry my skin at times.</li>
            <li> It keeps the oil at bay but still moisturizes the dry areas, gets rid of the pimples but still keeps my skin</li>
            <li> It does dry your face out quite a bit, so</li>
            <li> There have only been a few stretches of time that I did not have big problems with pimples, breakouts, and dry patches, and using this product was one of those times.</li>
            <li> I did some research with respect to customer satisfaction and felt I had nothing to loose in purchasing this kit, which by the way is $40+ cheaper than ProActive.  </li>
            <li> I finally STOPPED using this wretched product, and my skin calmed down</li>
            <li> Believe me, I will take dry skin over acne ridden skin any day!  </li>
            <li> I was concerned with having dry skin, as some of the reviews I read indicated this really dried their respective skin out, however, I did not find this was the case for me.  </li>
            <li> My face hasnt really made my skin worse</li>
            <li> Sometimes my cheeks are rough.</li>
            <li> Just dont give up on products when you are trying to see results in 3 days that stuff does not really happen.</li>
            <li> the different problems that I have--pimples of all sizes and severity, excessive oil, dry flakiness, rough patches</li>
            <li> While they insist that you&#x27;ll look different in a day, which, of course, is false, you will see a major difference within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to clear up their skin, and isn&#x27;t afraid of their face drying out.  </li>
            <li> I would use this alone, not with the other two.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort my skin over the past month has been freaking out</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was from her red inflamed face but DONT try it.</li>
            <li> And eventually you may want to start using this product every other day.  </li>
            <li> I started using them when i became pregnant with my second child because i was breaking out really bad after of few days of using these products</li>
            <li> After recently getting off birth control pills, my face started breaking out pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 zits in that time (which includes lots of traveling, using sunscreen, trying different heavy makeups, and wearing hats--all those things usually aggravate my skin).  </li>
            <li> But the only results I saw were negative ones, and after a month of using this, I decided to forget it.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly drying, but when you get dried out just skip a morning or night and let your face recover.  </li>
            <li> Her face had broken out really bad and it one day it cleared up 50% better by the 3day</li>
            <li> For me, this was almost a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It dried me out everywhere</li>
            <li> I noticed my face breaking out heavily..</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchase a small scubbing pad from CVS with this product.</li>
            <li> I often get small pimples on my forehead, blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> (not sure why I stopped</li>
            <li> Lately I started getting large, painful pimples on my cheeks as well.</li>
            <li> I used to get a few breakouts every so often, but recently I started getting really bad ones that didnt seem to go away.</li>
            <li> My skin hadn&#x27;t gotten bad enough for Accutane</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have bad acne prior to being on the pill.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have painful little pimples in my eyebrows or big, painful pimples on my chin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am unable to give this product 0 stars.  </li>
            <li> face is so clear--is there something wrong with me??!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> :  This stuff bleaches like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been having these terrible breakouts lately (over Christmas dinner, my grandmother asked \\&quot;what&#x27;s that on your face?\\&quot; So embarrassing!)</li>
            <li> It has Benzoyl peroxide which is really bad for your skin</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with products before but this one damaged my skin so badly</li>
            <li> She even got sick.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is awful, which is what broke me out, not the spot treatment or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (Omg, this sounds horrible, LoL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product within 24 hours i saw major results (: . You guys better buy this</li>
            <li> This Really Works. Don&#x27;t Hasitate to buy this acne kit. it works really good takes about 2 weeks to work but it really works.</li>
            <li> Ugh, I tried this kit about a year ago when my teenage acne was on the rocks. I got this at Walmart after hearing good reviews, I wanted to try this. For me, this was almost a waste of time. It has Benzoyl peroxide which is really bad for your skin, I heard it could increase your chances of developing skin cancer! Plus, this ingredient dries my skin out like no other.    The smallest bottle, which is the spot treatment I believe, is the best. I would use this alone, not with the other two. The cleanser is awful, which is what broke me out, not the spot treatment or moisturizer. I have combination skin, I was 13 when I tried this, and it did not help. It dried me out everywhere I could not even talk, eat, or move my jaw without pain! I was a flaker muther. The moisturizer did nothing to combat the flaky desert which was my skin. I needed heavy duty moisturizer for over a week to make my skin normal again. I thought about trying it again, but having dried up skin isn&#x27;t better than having acne. Some people would give up smooth, hydrated skin for flaky, dry, but acne-free skin. I wouldn&#x27;t, but if you would, maybe you should try this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am unable to give this product 0 stars.  Maybe this product is only for people with severe acne.  I didn&#x27;t see a distinction on the box so I thought I would try it as a cleanser for occasional breakouts.  I used all three products one night.  That night my skin felt amazing!  It was soft and smooth and felt clean.  The next morning I woke up with a bit of irritation above my lip (below my nose).  I figured I was just getting used to a new product and decided not to use it that night.  The next day, I woke up with what I can only assume is chemical burn all over my face!  This is from using the product once, two days prior!  I will deal with the occasional zit and spare myself the lovely shade of red I&#x27;ve become. I&#x27;m hoping it goes away soon.  Spare yourself the horror and just throw your money directly in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistantly for two years. I have oily skin and medium skin tone. This product works great for me even during my PMS. I am a keloid; scare easliy, and it does help to reduce the marks. I think it would work a lot better if I didn&#x27;t wear my hair on my face (the sides). The first week I used it I noticed remarkable clearing of my skin. This product would probably be a bit much for those with sensitive skin. I purchase a small scubbing pad from CVS with this product.</li>
            <li> MMkay. So I&#x27;m 13, and whenever I go around my period I start breaking out. I bought this product from Target and it works wonders!!! Step one refreshes my skin like mint and step 2 moisturizes wonderfully! This is the first time I used an acne product and my skin ACTUALLY felt smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given this a 4 1/2 because when I put the spot treatment on pimples, it burned like HELL.</li>
            <li> I am 23, so I very rarely get any raging red zits/pimples anymore. But, I do get blackheads and whiteheads on my chin and forehead, that, if I wanted to endure the pain of squeezing them out of my pores, and the annoyance of leaving red marks on my face for two days, I could get rid of. However, I tried the Clean &amp; Clear Spot Treatment for a couple weeks before my sister&#x27;s wedding, and it worked miracles! I actually smeared about a dime-sized amount on my face twice a day or as I remembered. You are actually supposed to use less and only on the actual problem area, but I figured an overload for a special occasion couldn&#x27;t hurt--and it didn&#x27;t! There was slight dryness near the sensitive parts of my eyes, but I&#x27;m sure if you use it a little more sparingly over a longer period of time, you will be fine! Not to mention, if you purchase the kit there is a moisturizer included. I am very pleased to see that there is a kit available for only around $8.00, which I am sure can only add to the product&#x27;s effectiveness. I&#x27;ll be finding out very soon! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be working at first, it does really dry out the blemishes..however into the second week of use I noticed my face breaking out heavily..a lot more than ever before on any other product and I have tried everything from Proactive, to Natural Soaps and Products, the dermatologist, Acne Free, The Body Shop&#x27;s line for acne, and nothing has worked so I was willing to try anything but this was unsuccessful. I stopped using this immediately after I got the major breakout and threw it in the trash. I am not saying it doesn&#x27;t work for some people but it did not work for me. I have fair and semi-sensitive skin and if you do to you might want to reconsider before trying this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because a friend said it had worked for them.  However, it did not work for me.  I have never had a problem with products before but this one damaged my skin so badly, I had to warn others...beware of what you try! Stay away from this one</li>
            <li> Effective in reducing breakouts when used as a regular regimen. Does over dry my skin at times.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort my skin over the past month has been freaking out and i got a bunch of huge zits everywhere. I picked this up and have been using it as directed (2 times a day) so far it has cleared up those little bumps i had on my forehead but the ones i got the kit for hasnt really improved. I have even had 2 pop up i dont know if its from the kit or not. I will continue to use it but i will prolly not buy this kit again. My face hasnt really made my skin worse but it hasnt made a huge difference either.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate/severe acne for most of my life since I hit puberty, and I&#x27;m now 25. There have only been a few stretches of time that I did not have big problems with pimples, breakouts, and dry patches, and using this product was one of those times. I have mostly oily skin, but dry flakiness around my nose and sometimes on my forehead. Sometimes my cheeks are rough. I often get small pimples on my forehead, blackheads on my nose. Sometimes I have painful little pimples in my eyebrows or big, painful pimples on my chin. Lately I started getting large, painful pimples on my cheeks as well. (Omg, this sounds horrible, LoL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried ProActiv, which worked great, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for me. I like that I can buy this when I&#x27;m ready, when I need it and can afford it, instead of being charged monthly and having it mailed to me like some other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Clean &amp; Clear Advantage kit once before and I loved it (not sure why I stopped--I think it&#x27;s just because I like trying new products). Since I&#x27;ve been having these terrible breakouts lately (over Christmas dinner, my grandmother asked \\&quot;what&#x27;s that on your face?\\&quot; So embarrassing!), I decided to try it again, and I think I will stick with it this time. I just used it for the first time this morning, and woooow, my face is so soft right now! I used the cleanser and the moisturizer and put the spot treatment on the several large pimples that I have right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the different problems that I have--pimples of all sizes and severity, excessive oil, dry flakiness, rough patches--it&#x27;s amazing that this product takes care of all of them. It keeps the oil at bay but still moisturizes the dry areas, gets rid of the pimples but still keeps my skin so very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I wasn&#x27;t using the whole kit, I always have the spot treatment on hand. That definitely clears up big problem zits quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve used and much quicker than they would go away on their own. And it&#x27;s clear! So you can put it on at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and highly reccommend it.ut it on at any time.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> Well I got all of the acne treatments, I didnt get the box though. I kinda wanted the box to go with my acne treatments. Also, it could be just me but the product might be a little old. But hopefully my mild ance might clear up soon. Wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li> I have tried probably everything on the market for my skin. I have sporadic acne but when I get it, I want it gone immediately! This is probably the closest product I&#x27;ve bought that can do that. I noticed results the very next day. Can&#x27;t say that for other items and those that even cost more! Great daily routine even when you don&#x27;t have breakouts. My skin feels smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Well, Ive been useing this product for about a week and I only have a few traces of acne left, which is very impressive!   ****But for everyone saying that \\&quot;100% of people had results within 24 hours\\&quot; is a lie, Just read ther fine print. It says 100% of people had changes in pimple color or size. So with their creative wording they tricked you. It could g&#x3D;change in color and size and get smaller and fainter... Or it could change in color and size and get larger and more red. But keep in mind we all have different skin which reacts differently to different produtss. This definatly worked for me!</li>
            <li> I rotate between this and the 3 in 1 version. Really does make a difference. I havent switched in years nor will I.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m an Accutane type of girl--that&#x27;s the only thing that has ever made a significant difference in my skin.  I took it several years ago and enjoyed flawless skin for a couple of years.  Since then, the zits have been creeping back in, and nothing has helped much (prescription topical things, antibiotics, hormone treatments).  My skin hadn&#x27;t gotten bad enough for Accutane again (I was considering it anyway) but it was bothering me and I&#x27;m getting married soon and want to look radiant, not pimply!  So anyway, I got this kit and have been using it for about 2 weeks.  I have had 2 zits in that time (which includes lots of traveling, using sunscreen, trying different heavy makeups, and wearing hats--all those things usually aggravate my skin).  The moisturizer component is key, as this definitely will dry you out (and let me say that NOTHING dries out my skin!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  This stuff bleaches like crazy.  My towels all have face-shaped discolorations and a couple of pillowcases have been wrecked.  This is not enough to make me stop using it or give it a lower rating!  Just be sure to use old towels and pillowcases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and it didn&#x27;t work onmy skin. And then I see this product that is 4 times cheaper so I ordered it.  Works great and you DO see the difference after only a day!  I recommend it all the way. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with bleaching towel or carpet but it&#x27;s probably cuz both of them are white ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to work but I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks. My problem area is right around my mouth along the path of hair follicles. I still breakout there regularly even though I&#x27;ve been using Clean and Clear. The only difference is they are not as large and as red as they were. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks and if I don&#x27;t see more improvement I&#x27;m going to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2-3 months and I absolutely love it! Like others, I have tried countless acne medications, but this one seems to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, without a doubt, recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this product!!!  After spending $60.+ on my first ProActive kit and using it for over two weeks with no results, just new blemishes, I decided to look into the Clean &amp; Clear control kit after seeing a commercial.  I did some research with respect to customer satisfaction and felt I had nothing to loose in purchasing this kit, which by the way is $40+ cheaper than ProActive.  I am here to tell you that after 2-days of using this product I began to see results, and within a week my skin felt and looked radiant.      I was concerned with having dry skin, as some of the reviews I read indicated this really dried their respective skin out, however, I did not find this was the case for me.  In fact, my skin appears to have more moisture in it now than before I began using the product.  I have always struggled w/finding the right moisturizer to use that will not break me out, but will aid with the drying I experience, especially during the winter months.  This is it, all in this kit, clears my acne up and provides as a great moisturizer as well.    Don&#x27;t hesitate, purchase this kit, I do believe you will be pleased with the results.  Also, be sure and go online to [...] to register for the $5.00 off coupon at time of purhcase.    Signed,    One happy clean &amp; clear customer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and at first it was great. Her face had broken out really bad and it one day it cleared up 50% better by the 3day it was barely noticeable. Then one night we started noticing bumps on her face. We just thought it was because she put make up on that day so she washed her face off. Well the next day her faces was covered in bumps and red and puffy. Not to mention it was itching and she felt like her face was on fire. She even got sick. Not sure if it was from her red inflamed face but DONT try it. She has NEVER broke out from anything until now!! So dont think it wont happen to you because you have not had allergic reactions to anything. Well think again......Dont waste your money. Unless you like having rash on your face instead of pimples!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been Using Clean &amp; Clear for a week now. I wanted to get rid of some blemishes because I was going to a trip to meet up with some old friends I have not seen in years. Instead of buying the kit I bought the C&amp;C Continuous Control Acne Cleanser wich has ten % benzoyl peroxide just like the cleanser in the kit, also the C&amp;C oil free dual action moisturizer with 0.5 &amp; of salicylic acid just like the one in the kit also, and their advantage acne spot treatment. I did this because These will last me longer than the kit( the kit will last you a month) and it all came to twenty-two dollars. So far so good My skin has improved. I had some acne on my cheeks and chin and they have cleared out. I still have a few pores but my chin area has become smooth, before it was very bumpy. I use it twice a day morning and before I go to sleep. I gave it a four because you might feel your skin dry but to the touch it feels soft and smooth. It also bleaches your towels so make sure you are using a white towel. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT IF YOU USE IT TWICE A DAY I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!!! I am also using this porduct with Natures Cure 2 step acne treatment for females, I heard very good reviews about it and so far these two products have worked wonders for me. Just dont give up on products when you are trying to see results in 3 days that stuff does not really happen. Im pretty sure my skin will clear up completely in one month.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old, and for a few years I have been getting acne around the jawline, cheeks and hairline.  There wouldn&#x27;t be a day I didn&#x27;t have at least one pimple, and usually I had more like clusters.  I really thought when I bought this kit 3 weeks ago it would be a scam like most other products, especially since it has the usual ingredients that I&#x27;ve tried before and failed with.  I don&#x27;t know what they do, but somehow this combo works, and works WELL. So much so, that when I look in the mirror in the morning (a PMS morning, no less), I actually think \\&quot;my face is so clear--is there something wrong with me??!!\\&quot;  If you have acne similar to mine, USE THIS, and don&#x27;t think its too good to be true.  It is slightly drying, but when you get dried out just skip a morning or night and let your face recover.  I love this stuff anyway!</li>
            <li> I started using these products about 2 years ago and love them! I started using them when i became pregnant with my second child because i was breaking out really bad after of few days of using these products i could see the difference, my soon to be husband has even started using them too and I could see the difference on his face within days. I recomend these products to everyone i know with blemish problems!!!! Thank you clean and clear!!</li>
            <li> It took a while to get results (2-3 weeks) but it did get significantly better after that. Amazingly it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face like most products.</li>
            <li> After recently getting off birth control pills, my face started breaking out pretty badly.  I am close to 30, and was only on the pill for about a year.  I also didn&#x27;t have bad acne prior to being on the pill.  Needless to say, I was less than pleased.  My sister recommended this product, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I was amazed at how quickly I saw results.  Truly within the first two days I saw amazing results, and by the end of the week I pretty much had my face back to normal!  It does dry your face out quite a bit, so it&#x27;s a good idea to make sure you use the moisturizer.  And eventually you may want to start using this product every other day.  Personally, I only use Step 1 and Step 2 of the kit, I don&#x27;t use the spot treatment.  Just the first two steps alone was enough to dry out my face and clear up my skin.  But of course, every person is different in their needs, so use this product as you see fit!  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to clear up their skin, and isn&#x27;t afraid of their face drying out.  Believe me, I will take dry skin over acne ridden skin any day!  Good luck to everyone else!</li>
            <li> I used to get a few breakouts every so often, but recently I started getting really bad ones that didnt seem to go away. This product cleared up my skin within 1-2 weeks. I noticed improvement every day. I like the cleanser because it left my skin feeling really refreshed. The lotion is a great alternative to other systems like Proactive which use a liquid toner as the second step. Finally, the spot treatment worked well but stung a little on my sensitive skin. This is why I did not give the product 5 stars. Def. give it a try though !</li>
            <li> While they insist that you&#x27;ll look different in a day, which, of course, is false, you will see a major difference within a couple of days. Be warned, though, if you stop using this system then you will break out again.</li>
            <li> Great product! The only thing that keeps my extremely oily skin under control. Instantly clears the skin in 1-3 days (depending on severity). Furthermore, the most amazing result is the oil/shine control.</li>
            <li> I picked this up about two months ago, after reading many good reviews from people who say it&#x27;s the \\&quot;only thing that works for them\\&quot; and that they had already tried medication and proactive.  I&#x27;ve never had severe acne, just irritated spotting around my nose and forehead area, but I wanted to aggressively see if I could get rid of it once and for all.  The box guaranteed results, saying that 100% of those in the trial had results after 24 hours.  Well, 24 hours later, I had NO results.  I finally got results about 72 hours later, when my skin started breaking out and NEW pimples started forming.  I used  it *exactly* as the directions dictated, all three steps, in the morning and before bed.  And each morning I was waking up to a new pimple.  I finally STOPPED using this wretched product, and my skin calmed down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my acne wasn&#x27;t severe enough for this, or maybe my skin is too sensitive.  I don&#x27;t know.  But the only results I saw were negative ones, and after a month of using this, I decided to forget it.  I now use Burt&#x27;s Bees Tomato Toner, and that has cleared my face and calmed the redness caused by this product.  Yech.</li>
