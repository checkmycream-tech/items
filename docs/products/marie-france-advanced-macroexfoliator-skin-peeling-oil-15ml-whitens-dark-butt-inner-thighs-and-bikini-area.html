            <li>I was very excited I found this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>try using a smaller amount and might be very pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me</li>
            <li>It did make my skin lighter in the areas that DID peel but immediately after I was done peeling my skin became DARKER than it originally was.</li>
            <li>Did not try this item as the bottle was not in original packaging and looked to be already opened.</li>
            <li>It certainly lighten the redness of KP in my arms, and I ended having very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I can go to the beach without hiding and feel so clean</li>
            <li>Wow this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly it worked well on a deep scar I had.</li>
            <li>but you have to read the full instructions.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I realized that the suggested dose was too strong for me and ended up darkening my underarms a tad bit.</li>
            <li>I have Keratosis pilaris, and I decided to do mild peel.</li>
            <li>so I tried this and after following directions the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>rarely was it itchy.</li>
            <li>and I did everything right.</li>
            <li>First of all, i didn&#x27;t believe on those comments that said this product does not work.</li>
            <li>So after i used it, it actually made my skin more darker and now i regret that i didn&#x27;t believe on those comments that were warnings.</li>
            <li>I actually went ahead and purchase more of this product am hoping to get it soon as it was sold out.</li>
            <li>Stop being be so stingy and provide a reasonable amount of product !</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Used exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s nice and pink but that area always bothered me</li>
            <li>but the first days after it peels</li>
            <li>If I so much as turned in bed my skin would rip!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of dark around my vagina</li>
            <li>so it kind of looks odd.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:669c705ff462b9721de7fc9a14851d79]]The final result was ok, new skin, it peeled on everywhere</li>
            <li>It gets really itchy.</li>
            <li>It peels fast.</li>
            <li>Hydro cortisone cream didn&#x27;t really help</li>
            <li>Buy lots of cortizone cream because the itching can get intense as you&#x27;re skin is peeling.</li>
            <li>but i didnt want to spend to much money if i didnt have</li>
            <li>I really did not see any peeling I decided to stop using it</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I peeled.</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>Product works good but company customers service sucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m average size (8) weight</li>
            <li>I boght petroleum jelly to keep the new skin protected and hydrocortisone because it can get really itchy.</li>
            <li>I Wish it lightened a little more on hyperpigmented areas..</li>
            <li>I used it normally</li>
            <li>This product works really well, I only orded the oil at first but after seeing the results I then orded the soap and the cream.</li>
            <li>I have dark skin that have a nice brownish red undertone to it.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy person</li>
            <li>Do not force it to peel or darkness will occur.i had to learn the hard way but other than that great product.</li>
            <li>The area that I used it on is completely clear of any darkness at all!</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 so far!</li>
            <li>I have fresher/pinkish skin and my old skin</li>
            <li>so if you start peeling as fast as i did you shoould skip you third day if you dont wont to burn.</li>
            <li>My wife has used it twice so far and we still haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, it really worked for me just be careful and follow the instructions you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have brown skin which is high risk to get hyperpigmentation, thus I was worried initially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a redbone (high yellow)</li>
            <li>Just be careful how much you use!    </li>
            <li>I started peeling sometime after day two and by my third application i was peeling completely.</li>
            <li>Especially on such a sensitive area.</li>
            <li>and the new skin was red and is still red.</li>
            <li>I think I used a little too much because my ball sack and pooper started itching and peeling too!</li>
            <li>The second time however I used a little less and only did it for two days rather than 3 and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>But it work real well on the dark spots on my knees.</li>
            <li>Apparently for Asian skin it needs to be applied once a day.  </li>
            <li>My first impression of this tiny little bottle was that I got ripped off.</li>
            <li>( it did peel really fast but not worth it)  not for brown skin people definitely!!</li>
            <li>this is a great product to get rid of discoloration it actually made me about two shades lighter however, it didn&#x27;t get rid of dark spots I had from chicken pox</li>

            <li> ( it did peel really fast but not worth it)  not for brown skin people definitely!!</li>
            <li> this is a great product to get rid of discoloration it actually made me about two shades lighter however, it didn&#x27;t get rid of dark spots I had from chicken pox</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good but because my thighs run together really bad some area ended up turning back dark.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is obviously that it itches and you can&#x27;t clean the area thoroughly when you&#x27;re showering (just water) which is really difficult when you want to use it on your armpits.</li>
            <li> Its time comsuming and for me it only left my skin darker did not even peel and I did everything, I even took towel showers so i wouldnt get the area that I was treating wet.</li>
            <li> and so that caused my inner thigh to become very dry and</li>
            <li> Failure (in large part) due to the fact it simply wasn&#x27;t enough product to cover my backside.</li>
            <li> Minimal peeling on inner thighs.</li>
            <li> and it left a big black scar.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to give other guys a simple review</li>
            <li> I should have heeded to the other customers advice but was hoping it would be a different case with me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just uncomfortable it gets better after a few days</li>
            <li> One of my boobs had a dark patch left over from the rash, and I&#x27;ve never had eczema before in my life!!!</li>
            <li> it got really red than turned really dark.</li>
            <li> Started peeling by the 4th day and completed peeling within a week and a half after the last application.  </li>
            <li> I came back and change my review because at first I was not impressed, but IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> It also says that it will take 4 days of peeling but if you read the instructions carefully it can take up to a week for your skin to START peeling.</li>
            <li> The peeled area is now wet, too.</li>
            <li> Just be careful wiping and drying yourself it does burn I used diaper rash cream hydroguard</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The skin is pink and new and you will get raw!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of other things and nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li> i read that other people had this problem</li>
            <li> Mine took a couple of tries because my areas were so dark.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any itching at all although be careful!</li>
            <li> And I also wonder what &amp;#34;RA powder,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much useless don&#x27;t waste your money , if I could give it zero stars</li>
            <li> I have dark under arms</li>
            <li> Mine were sooooo dark</li>
            <li> I really forced the skin to peel as it was coming off constantly.</li>
            <li> , I had some dark spots due to keratosis (accumulation of dead skin), and it worked.  </li>
            <li> (YOU CAN&#x27;T SWEAT, USE SOAP, TIGHT CLOTHING, WALK ALOT)</li>
            <li> Since I wasn&#x27;t focused on skin lightening,  I was unable to see any changes but my ingrowns were gone until new skin formed.</li>
            <li> All I know is I already wasted half of my money for nothing.</li>
            <li> little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I used some twizers  to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I will redo the peel in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This product is SERIOUS so be careful and BE PATIENT.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m more scarred than before and my sex life is even worse!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not able to function the itch</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my bikini line from bad shaving techniques when I was younger that I wanted to lighten.</li>
            <li> This is a very small plastic container and not sure how it was packed.</li>
            <li> still used the rest of the oil anyway, because I was that desperate to whiten my under arms and inner thighs.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This is a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> Delivery was slow.</li>
            <li> just thick thighs</li>
            <li> Try to resist the temptation to itch otherwise you will seriously ifritate your skin.</li>
            <li> almost half of the small container spilled and that is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Warning: the first time you use it it&#x27;s going to itch like CRAZY!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very thick not FAT</li>
            <li> Irritating but works....</li>
            <li> The change before and after the peel was not great.</li>

            <li> does not work on elbows</li>
            <li> First of all, i didn&#x27;t believe on those comments that said this product does not work. so i purchased this product along with kojic soap and creme tone because i wanted to try out if this product does work like what some people said. So after i used it, it actually made my skin more darker and now i regret that i didn&#x27;t believe on those comments that were warnings. So i don&#x27;t recommend to anybody in the future to buy this product if you don&#x27;t want to regret like me. P.S I am telling the truth based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes you peel.  I followed the directions and received the skin peeling I was looking for.  I am a caramel Asian, so I only followed the directions of only applying twice a day for three days.  Started peeling by the 4th day and completed peeling within a week and a half after the last application.  I used it to treat ingrown hairs, not whitening, so I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in skin color.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:669c705ff462b9721de7fc9a14851d79]]The final result was ok, new skin, it peeled on everywhere that i applied I Wish it lightened a little more on hyperpigmented areas..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use any  hydrocortisone, only vaseline on itchy areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the finish result isn&#x27;t what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again... I might give away what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> Irritating but works.... It gets really itchy. Try to resist the temptation to itch otherwise you will seriously ifritate your skin. And in betwent the thighs was a pain too. Your skin is literally raw after the peel so your thighs rubbing hirts really bad. I had to keep powder on my legs every hours to keep the rub from being too annoying.</li>
            <li> I love this product! For years I have been looking for something that whithening my armpit and apix of my legs and nothing worked. Visit dermatologists and they just prescribed hydroquinone lotions. I tried this product and i have seen amazing results. I applied it 3x a day for three days. During these 3 days i wash these areas with only water. I tried not to sweat those days. So i staryed started a Friday night and ended on Monday morning. And skin started peeling on the third day. I used some twizers  to remove dead skin. I boght petroleum jelly to keep the new skin protected and hydrocortisone because it can get really itchy.</li>
            <li> I did this peel on my underarms two times in a period of 6 months. The first time I used it I realized that the suggested dose was too strong for me and ended up darkening my underarms a tad bit. The change before and after the peel was not great. The second time however I used a little less and only did it for two days rather than 3 and it worked much better. It was more tolerable and the change in tone was greater. If you have been using this and are not convinced it works try using a smaller amount and might be very pleasantly surpised. I will be buying more to continue to lighten my underarms gradually.</li>
            <li> OMG I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this product is. I&#x27;ve used a lot of other things and nothing seemed to help. Only 3 days after using this product, the area is noticeable whiter. It hurts like hell tho!</li>
            <li> If you do exactly what the instructions say then you should get great results. My skin started peeling a day after my last day applying it and peeled for about 4-5 days. It maybe became a shade lighter but I couldn&#x27;t tell yet because it was red but I could see it was lighter. I messed up because when it started peeling I didn&#x27;t moisturize the area because I didn&#x27;t know it I could until I went back to read it and so that caused my inner thigh to become very dry and plus my thighs rub together so the area kinda &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; I guess. It hurt really bad and I couldn&#x27;t even walk correctly. I used some neosprorin on it and it helped. Overall the product is good but because my thighs run together really bad some area ended up turning back dark. I will redo the peel in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to get rid of discoloration it actually made me about two shades lighter however, it didn&#x27;t get rid of dark spots I had from chicken pox but surprisingly it worked well on a deep scar I had. I actually went ahead and purchase more of this product am hoping to get it soon as it was sold out.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much useless don&#x27;t waste your money , if I could give it zero stars I will</li>
            <li> Product works good but company customers service sucks.</li>
            <li> So I purchase this product before reading the instructions on how to use and basically your not suppose to do anything while you apply the treatment for 3days and the peeling process. (YOU CAN&#x27;T SWEAT, USE SOAP, TIGHT CLOTHING, WALK ALOT) I meen like come on. It also says that it will take 4 days of peeling but if you read the instructions carefully it can take up to a week for your skin to START peeling. That means no sweating, showers, etc.  Its time comsuming and for me it only left my skin darker did not even peel and I did everything, I even took towel showers so i wouldnt get the area that I was treating wet. Waist of TIME AND MONEY!! Use there cream better that one works good.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this product a 1/2 star. Reason:Followed instructions to the letter. Results: Minimal peeling on inner thighs. No peeling at all on buttocks. Skin:Lightened approx. 5%. Conclusion: Will NEVER purchase again. Reason: Not enough product for the price. Conclusion: Failure (in large part) due to the fact it simply wasn&#x27;t enough product to cover my backside. I&#x27;m average size (8) weight 130lbs. Stop being be so stingy and provide a reasonable amount of product !</li>
            <li> I was very excited I found this item.&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered it as a kit and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when the package arrived.&lt;br /&gt;The peeling oil had been leaking! It stained the soap box and everything inside the package yellow.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the cap wasn&#x27;t fully closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still used the rest of the oil anyway, because I was that desperate to whiten my under arms and inner thighs.&lt;br /&gt;For my case, peeling started on the third day of the application so it hurt a bit, but I still finished all applications as instructed. It peels fast. and the new skin was red and is still red. The peeled area is now wet, too. It was too strong for me and I came to a conclusion that I got a chemical burn. I also tried the kojic soap and cream but it was a bad idea. Hydro cortisone cream didn&#x27;t really help so I&#x27;m now applying aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if the area you would like to whiten gets constant friction, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the oil, but just the soap and the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually gonna try the soap and the cream after the peeled areas heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times in my bikini area and underarms. Warning: the first time you use it it&#x27;s going to itch like CRAZY!!! It kind of worked and kind of didn&#x27;t. I did make my skin peel (as gross as that sounds) but it wouldn&#x27;t completly peel in all of the places I put it so now I have fresher/pinkish skin and my old skin so it kind of looks odd. I guess it was most successful for my underarms.</li>
            <li> Apparently for Asian skin it needs to be applied once a day.  I used it normally and it left a big black scar. Now i am using products to try to lighten the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I&#x27;d like to give other guys a simple review, I had some dark spots due to keratosis (accumulation of dead skin), and it worked.  If you want to remove layers of dead skin, this product really works.  I only have to apply it a couple of times and 3 days later I&#x27;m peeling.  Buy lots of cortizone cream because the itching can get intense as you&#x27;re skin is peeling.</li>
            <li> This skin peel worked nicely, two layers of skin peeled off within 4 days and it is noticeably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once used correctly you will see results. It just causes the skin to get a red an itchy but it clears up after it peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product overall</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it really worked for me just be careful and follow the instructions you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Delivery was slow. But product works great</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have dark under arms so I tried this and after following directions the difference is amazing. My underarms are lighter. I have enuf in the bottle to do 2 treatments. I plan to do another in a month or 2. I can wear tank tops again</li>
            <li> I started peeling sometime after day two and by my third application i was peeling completely. I did end up burning myself on the thiird day wasnt tto painful so if you start peeling as fast as i did you shoould skip you third day if you dont wont to burn. Also peeling way more than I wanted to.   Edit: now give zero stars my skin has become darker i read that other people had this problem but i didnt want to spend to much money if i didnt have to i regret that. Now ill be spending even more to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> Do not force it to peel or darkness will occur.i had to learn the hard way but other than that great product. there was lots of peeling.next time i knw to let the skin come off on its own</li>
            <li> With me being a first-time user and of Asian descent, I only applied the oil once daily for three days. It started peeling on the fourth day. I have not scrubbed, soaped, nor applied deodorant to my underarms. However, my skin still ended up darkening even worsr than when I started.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Because using this product. .it works but you have to read the full instructions.</li>
            <li> Wow this product is amazing. I can&#x27;t believe it worked. I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just got the product and when I open it up it was leaking..almost half of the small container spilled and that is so disappointing. This is a very small plastic container and not sure how it was packed. All I know is I already wasted half of my money for nothing. I am a very busy person and I have no time to pack and return this again. This is a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> Used exactly as instructed. I started peeling on the third day.  I didn&#x27;t experience any burning n rarely was it itchy. After a week I had peeled a lot but in some areas did not peel at all where I applied the application. It did make my skin lighter in the areas that DID peel but immediately after I was done peeling my skin became DARKER than it originally was. I did NOT force peeling, use soap, or rub the area at all as instructed which said it would cause the skin to become darker but it still did. Was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil does just what it says it will do! Obviously a great thing. I used it for my inner thighs and my thighs peeled the next day. You can actually pull off your skin and see the brighter skin underneath. Kinda bizarre! The only thing that bothers me is obviously that it itches and you can&#x27;t clean the area thoroughly when you&#x27;re showering (just water) which is really difficult when you want to use it on your armpits. It still does its job though so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it twice so far and we still haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dark butt cheeks and it is peeling like crazy! I think I used a little too much because my ball sack and pooper started itching and peeling too! IT WAS HELL WHEN I WENT TO MY CLASS! But it works! Just be careful how much you use!    Update- WARNING! It&#x27;s been two weeks now and my butt is so much darker than before!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED! Time to get back to using bleaching/whitening cream now...</li>
            <li> I really did not see any peeling I decided to stop using it</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to work and actually my skin got darker and it itches a lot. Will NOT buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not try this item as the bottle was not in original packaging and looked to be already opened. There was a hair under the screw top lid.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, I only orded the oil at first but after seeing the results I then orded the soap and the cream.</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis pilaris, and I decided to do mild peel. I am extremely satisfied with this product. I have brown skin which is high risk to get hyperpigmentation, thus I was worried initially. Instead of using 6 applications, I only did 3 and already seen results of peeling the next day. It certainly lighten the redness of KP in my arms, and I ended having very smooth skin. I have purchased 3 so far!</li>
            <li> Yeah so my skin peeled but gosh did it itch. I have dark spots on my bikini line from bad shaving techniques when I was younger that I wanted to lighten. I have dark skin that have a nice brownish red undertone to it. After I used this product on my bikini line it gave the area I used it on a washed out color. Plus the fact that you can&#x27;t wash or do nothing blew my mind! I will never use it again. Especially on such a sensitive area. I&#x27;ve was some of the bad reviews and I just pray that my bikini line doesn&#x27;t darken after this!!!</li>
            <li> Ok soooo&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a redbone (high yellow) and I&#x27;m very thick not FAT just thick thighs big asss I&#x27;m saying how it is so those that can relate ... Anyways&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of dark around my vagina then it&#x27;s nice and pink but that area always bothered me so I bought this follow the 10 minute 6x instruction and after 4 days it started peeling but OMFG the itch was unbearable I stay in the gym I was not able to function the itch and it&#x27;s just uncomfortable it gets better after a few days but the first days after it peels you will go through it&lt;br /&gt;It does work tho apply Vaseline it soothes the itch irritation feeling you will get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. I use to have chicken bumps and it&#x27;s all gone now. My sister used this as well on her knees to remove some scars and it worked for her too.</li>
            <li> I used this peel as instructed without using soap and did not rub the area. My skin began to peel on the third day in some places and others never started. The skin was peeling like crazy so it wasn&#x27;t like I really forced the skin to peel as it was coming off constantly. The skin started out lighter and later became two shades darker. I used it on my breast and before igot to the third day it started peeling. Again I didn&#x27;t force peeling the skin just came off. My breast broke out in a eczema like rash that itched like bloody hell. One of my boobs had a dark patch left over from the rash, and I&#x27;ve never had eczema before in my life!!! If I so much as turned in bed my skin would rip! I can&#x27;t believe this happened to me and I did everything right. Now I&#x27;m more scarred than before and my sex life is even worse!!!!</li>
            <li> It made my skin 2-3 shades darker omg !!!! The pain &amp; itching was not worth it at alll !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Burned my skin. My skin is now even darker than before!</li>
            <li> I love it ...little goes along way. Seen my armpits and thighs color improved. Mine were sooooo dark and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I peeled. I will never be without this. Helps with the bumps too. Just be careful wiping and drying yourself it does burn I used diaper rash cream hydroguard and it helped with the burning. Mine took a couple of tries because my areas were so dark. But so happy I purchased this. I can go to the beach without hiding and feel so clean</li>
            <li> It works! I did not use this for skin lightening but used it for ingrown hairs and for that it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful! Since I wasn&#x27;t focused on skin lightening,  I was unable to see any changes but my ingrowns were gone until new skin formed. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so time consuming and that it was shipped quicker and there was more product than .5oz. And I also wonder what &amp;#34;RA powder,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my renewed skin!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would work but it made the area darker.I should have heeded to the other customers advice but was hoping it would be a different case with me.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this tiny little bottle was that I got ripped off. You do need a magnifying glass to read the instructions, but let me tell you- IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY!! I am stunned at this product. I did everything as instructed and I am still peeling. The area that I used it on is completely clear of any darkness at all! It&#x27;s really amazing. I did not experience any itching at all although be careful! DO NOT SCRUB WHERE YOU USED IT ONCE YOU ARE PEELING! The skin is pink and new and you will get raw!! This product is SERIOUS so be careful and BE PATIENT. I came back and change my review because at first I was not impressed, but IT WORKS. I just ordered another bottle and I will use it every 6 weeks for maintenance. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but that&#x27;s to be expected. PSC gives you the directions on the product description since it doesn&#x27;t come with any. But I started using this on Monday and I&#x27;m on the 3rd day of the application process and my butt started peeling! This product works amazingly fast. Can&#x27;t wait for my thighs to start peeling aswell.</li>
            <li> It made my skin darker it got really red than turned really dark. I did follow instructions.  I do not recommend this product!!!  ( it did peel really fast but not worth it)  not for brown skin people definitely!!</li>
            <li> This actually works, BUT BECAREFUL, &amp; follow directions, because you can burn yourself  or cause a rash. But it work real well on the dark spots on my knees.</li>
