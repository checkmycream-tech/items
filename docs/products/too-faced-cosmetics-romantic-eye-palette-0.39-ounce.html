            <li>palette is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>skin tone is olive, so purples, as much as I love them, aren&#x27;t the best on me.  </li>

            <li>All in all, this is a nice palette, but if you have warm skin tones, you may want to pass.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- a lot of these colors don&#x27;t work well for warm skin</li>
            <li>She is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i liked that it came with instruction cards</li>
            <li>What I really liked about this product is having some &#x27;business cards&#x27; tucking into the case that gives you step-by-step instructions on where to place the eye shadow, color by color.</li>
            <li>love the fact that my husband was quite pleased with my &#x27;look&#x27;, saying my eye&#x27;s &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; out..., in a good way.</li>
            <li>I did my own makeup and it turned out better than if I had paid someone else to apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think she will just love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>Kiss the Bride blends into my pinkish skin tone, and Bouquet seems very light on me.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my fair skin tone, year round.</li>

            <li>I love the Fashion look (with Soulmates as my highlight color)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look so great when you see the pallet in the box, but it really is \\&quot;romantic\\&quot;  when it goes on your eyes.</li>
            <li>And I love the names of each of the shadows.</li>
            <li>I love the color combinations and the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the \\&quot;Fashion\\&quot;</li>

            <li>I love Too Faced pallets</li>
            <li>I love these colors.  </li>
            <li>But I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and it has lasted me forever.</li>
            <li>I would think they would make sure that the product made it in one piece.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with the colors.</li>
            <li>Plus I love too faced products.</li>
            <li>I really love this palette.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite eyeshadow palets.  </li>
            <li>Love this palette.</li>
            <li>My mom owns the matte palette and I love shimmer formulation</li>
            <li>much, much more</li>
            <li>Love the color combo that this palette contains.</li>
            <li>When I received it the top part of the make up palette had came apart from the bottom part which upset me.</li>
            <li>Still, I really love the colors.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for palettes and I can either make an easy look by following one of the lines of colors or I can mix and match.</li>
            <li>Perfectly matched with cards to show how to do different looks, very good quality and box is larger than looked in picture</li>
            <li>and they are steal for their price because they give you nine colors that last for a very good amount of time</li>
            <li>and I love how smoothly they apply.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product so much ....</li>
            <li>I am older and this eye shadow combo does a wonderful job giving my eyes a more youthful and soft appearance.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this, but it was just meh... and for the price, it should have been more!</li>
            <li>the glittery colors crumble easily and get glitter all over your face</li>
            <li>This is easily a go to palette.</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice, sturdy, and fairly small, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is nice, sturdy, and fairly small, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li>and it has always looked fine for</li>
            <li>Packaging super cute</li>
            <li>First Dance is nice and deep, so that look is great for a purple smokey</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are super wearable, but they are also very unique.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and the little &amp;#34;how to apply cards&amp;#34; that are included are</li>
            <li>Perfect for green eyes</li>
            <li>The colors glide on smoothly and blend with ease.  </li>
            <li>Pigmentation is fantastic.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a nice palette, but if you have warm skin tones, you may want to pass.ame with blending - colors blend well, but not QUITE as well as Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for everyday use AND special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when it was shipped to me the very top left shadow (The cream) was smashed on the top layer</li>
            <li>They are smooth, true colors.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shades are Honeymoon, Cut the Cake, First Dance, and Everafter.</li>
            <li>As usually with Too Faced, it is a perfect palette.</li>
            <li>It would be the third favorite out of all the too faced palettes I own.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, so I really like the highlighters and the middle row for the crease for a nice eye brightening natural look.</li>
            <li>Pigmentation is good, though not QUITE up to the level of Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>I have only begun buying good make up as opposed to drug store brands.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, the colors are really versatile and pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of &amp;#34;Painting by Numbers&amp;#34;..., I&#x27;m that old.</li>
            <li>The classic is lovely too.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow palette but this is the last time I will be buying makeup from this distributor/amazon as the color I was most looking forward to using is smashed.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of their makeuP. Color is so vibrant.</li>
            <li>This palette has 9 shadows in some very pretty shades.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very beautiful and the colors last all day long.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Shadow goes on smooth and is very blendable.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite eyeshadow pallet.</li>
            <li>This is definitaly a pallet worth buying.....</li>
            <li>Honestly, this palette is really all I need as far as eyeshadow goes.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be fun to have something with directions.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;d buy more, but I am glad to have received these for gifts and will use them until they are gone!</li>
            <li>Would very much recomend this to anyone trying to get a soft sexy eye.</li>
            <li>Now The good part is ... was that there was still a very large amount of the shadow in the pallet so it didnt loose that much.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect, not too sheer, and not so thick that it cakes up in the creases like cheap brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the Natural Eye Palette and love it so much that I wanted to build my</li>
            <li>My daughter is a big fan of too faced cosmetics and when I found this a lot more affordable on Amazon, rather than the pricier department stores, I purchased it right away for her birthday.</li>
            <li>I think this palette is a bargain, and it fits a unique niche in the makeup world (nude yet new colors).</li>
            <li>They are organized along 3 \\&quot;looks\\&quot; - Day, Classic, and Fashion - and come with 3 corresponding looks cards, but you can obviously create your own looks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pretty peachy beige with a touch of shimmer&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shadow stays put pretty nicely-usually when I line my lower lashes with shadow it gets in my eyes and irritates them to the point where they tear up</li>
            <li>This is my first Too Faced makeup product as well</li>
            <li>and I feel pretty again.</li>
            <li>and I have bright green and hazel eyes</li>
            <li>I LOVE the middle (Purple) colors of the pallet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have bought it, I have used it for going out, weddings, daily makeup, and more.</li>
            <li>I really love Soulmates as a highlight and inner tear duct.</li>
            <li>They are good for everyday applications.  </li>
            <li>liked the way the colors complimented each other.  </li>
            <li>(I use the Urban Decay Good Karma - it&#x27;s the one that comes with the Naked Palette) while holding tissue under your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided on this palette versus the other similar Too Faced ones because I thought it had the most diversity and most use.</li>
            <li>(these are the large color blocks on the palette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so when I opened my package I was greeted with a large swirl of glittery shadow.</li>
            <li>I have always used very high end shadows.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye shadow pallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used Kiss the Bride and Bouquet Toss.</li>
            <li>i did looked very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>this is a high end product.  </li>
            <li>Still certainly a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a little more staying power.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about the color palette is that you can &#x27;Intensify&#x27; your look by increasing the darker, bolder colors for those times when you&#x27;re whooping it up late at night.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced very little fall out while applying, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2.</li>
            <li>im new to make up</li>
            <li>also ordered some new brushes to go along with the new shadow palette</li>
            <li>All and all this palette is a good one, but don&#x27;t let the dark colors fool you because they actually don&#x27;t go on as dark as they look.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as if you bought it in stores.</li>
            <li>I have very dark hair, dark eyes and am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>Finding the right palette was important because I didn&#x27;t want to draw the wrong kind of &#x27;attention&#x27; to my eyes, due to the above mentioned wrinkles, instead giving them some &#x27;appeal&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I really like how it came with instructions on how to use the colors and gave me three different looks.  </li>
            <li>Also comes with cards to help you apply the product like a professional.</li>
            <li>For a woman who knows what she&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s probably simple but for a novice like me, not so much.  </li>
            <li>shimmery shadows are pretty loose and have tons of fall out.</li>
            <li>I also highly suggest the NAKED EYE.  </li>
            <li>Good:&lt;br /&gt;- the matte white, pink, and soft green colors go on smoothly and are pretty</li>
            <li>I have some issues with muddiness if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>I have some issues with muddiness if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>I am just sorry I waited so long to buy good quality makeup.</li>
            <li>The pink was slightly more subtle than I thought (but computers can&#x27;t be expected to show colours EXACTLY).</li>
            <li>I didnt worry to much about it because other than that the shadows and packaging was unharmedand</li>
            <li>It stays on long and so natural looking!  </li>
            <li>If you are tired of the same old nude or natural eye palette, you should pick this up because it contains natural yet exciting colors.</li>
            <li>Right behind natural eyes and natural matte eyes.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of &amp;#34;neutrals&amp;#34; palettes and this is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s different from others that I have in that it has some fun colors (pink, purple and green) that still work well for a natural look.</li>
            <li>These shadows are very pigmented so you only need to apply a little bit of the product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;i love the \\&quot;Fashion\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a lovely palette.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I love this palette and the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Too Faced collection more.  </li>
            <li> I love these Too Faced palettes.</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced pallets</li>
            <li> I love these colors.  </li>
            <li> But I love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and it has lasted me forever.</li>
            <li> I would think they would make sure that the product made it in one piece.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with the colors.</li>
            <li> Plus I love too faced products.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eyeshadow palets.  </li>
            <li> Love this palette.</li>
            <li> My mom owns the matte palette and I love shimmer formulation</li>
            <li> much, much more</li>
            <li> Love the color combo that this palette contains.</li>
            <li> When I received it the top part of the make up palette had came apart from the bottom part which upset me.</li>
            <li> Still, I really love the colors.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect for palettes and I can either make an easy look by following one of the lines of colors or I can mix and match.</li>
            <li> Perfectly matched with cards to show how to do different looks, very good quality and box is larger than looked in picture</li>
            <li> and they are steal for their price because they give you nine colors that last for a very good amount of time</li>
            <li> and I love how smoothly they apply.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product so much ....</li>
            <li> I am older and this eye shadow combo does a wonderful job giving my eyes a more youthful and soft appearance.</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this, but it was just meh... and for the price, it should have been more!</li>
            <li> the glittery colors crumble easily and get glitter all over your face</li>
            <li> This is easily a go to palette.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice, sturdy, and fairly small, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> Packaging is nice, sturdy, and fairly small, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> and it has always looked fine for</li>
            <li> Packaging super cute</li>
            <li> First Dance is nice and deep, so that look is great for a purple smokey</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are super wearable, but they are also very unique.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and the little &amp;#34;how to apply cards&amp;#34; that are included are</li>
            <li> Perfect for green eyes</li>
            <li> The colors glide on smoothly and blend with ease.  </li>
            <li> Pigmentation is fantastic.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a nice palette, but if you have warm skin tones, you may want to pass.ame with blending - colors blend well, but not QUITE as well as Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for everyday use AND special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when it was shipped to me the very top left shadow (The cream) was smashed on the top layer</li>
            <li> They are smooth, true colors.  </li>
            <li> My favorite shades are Honeymoon, Cut the Cake, First Dance, and Everafter.</li>
            <li> As usually with Too Faced, it is a perfect palette.</li>
            <li> It would be the third favorite out of all the too faced palettes I own.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, so I really like the highlighters and the middle row for the crease for a nice eye brightening natural look.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is good, though not QUITE up to the level of Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li> I have only begun buying good make up as opposed to drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, the colors are really versatile and pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Kind of reminds me of &amp;#34;Painting by Numbers&amp;#34;..., I&#x27;m that old.</li>
            <li> The classic is lovely too.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette but this is the last time I will be buying makeup from this distributor/amazon as the color I was most looking forward to using is smashed.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of their makeuP. Color is so vibrant.</li>
            <li> This palette has 9 shadows in some very pretty shades.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very beautiful and the colors last all day long.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Shadow goes on smooth and is very blendable.  </li>
            <li> By far my favorite eyeshadow pallet.</li>
            <li> This is definitaly a pallet worth buying.....</li>
            <li> Honestly, this palette is really all I need as far as eyeshadow goes.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be fun to have something with directions.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d buy more, but I am glad to have received these for gifts and will use them until they are gone!</li>
            <li> Would very much recomend this to anyone trying to get a soft sexy eye.</li>
            <li> Now The good part is ... was that there was still a very large amount of the shadow in the pallet so it didnt loose that much.</li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect, not too sheer, and not so thick that it cakes up in the creases like cheap brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the Natural Eye Palette and love it so much that I wanted to build my</li>
            <li> My daughter is a big fan of too faced cosmetics and when I found this a lot more affordable on Amazon, rather than the pricier department stores, I purchased it right away for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I think this palette is a bargain, and it fits a unique niche in the makeup world (nude yet new colors).</li>
            <li> They are organized along 3 \\&quot;looks\\&quot; - Day, Classic, and Fashion - and come with 3 corresponding looks cards, but you can obviously create your own looks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pretty peachy beige with a touch of shimmer&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shadow stays put pretty nicely-usually when I line my lower lashes with shadow it gets in my eyes and irritates them to the point where they tear up</li>
            <li> This is my first Too Faced makeup product as well</li>
            <li> and I feel pretty again.</li>
            <li> and I have bright green and hazel eyes</li>
            <li> I LOVE the middle (Purple) colors of the pallet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have bought it, I have used it for going out, weddings, daily makeup, and more.</li>
            <li> I really love Soulmates as a highlight and inner tear duct.</li>
            <li> They are good for everyday applications.  </li>
            <li> liked the way the colors complimented each other.  </li>
            <li> (I use the Urban Decay Good Karma - it&#x27;s the one that comes with the Naked Palette) while holding tissue under your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided on this palette versus the other similar Too Faced ones because I thought it had the most diversity and most use.</li>
            <li> (these are the large color blocks on the palette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so when I opened my package I was greeted with a large swirl of glittery shadow.</li>
            <li> I have always used very high end shadows.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye shadow pallet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versatile.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used Kiss the Bride and Bouquet Toss.</li>
            <li> i did looked very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> this is a high end product.  </li>
            <li> Still certainly a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little more staying power.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about the color palette is that you can &#x27;Intensify&#x27; your look by increasing the darker, bolder colors for those times when you&#x27;re whooping it up late at night.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced very little fall out while applying, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2.</li>
            <li> im new to make up</li>
            <li> also ordered some new brushes to go along with the new shadow palette</li>
            <li> All and all this palette is a good one, but don&#x27;t let the dark colors fool you because they actually don&#x27;t go on as dark as they look.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as if you bought it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, dark eyes and am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> Finding the right palette was important because I didn&#x27;t want to draw the wrong kind of &#x27;attention&#x27; to my eyes, due to the above mentioned wrinkles, instead giving them some &#x27;appeal&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I really like how it came with instructions on how to use the colors and gave me three different looks.  </li>
            <li> Also comes with cards to help you apply the product like a professional.</li>
            <li> For a woman who knows what she&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s probably simple but for a novice like me, not so much.  </li>
            <li> shimmery shadows are pretty loose and have tons of fall out.</li>
            <li> I also highly suggest the NAKED EYE.  </li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;- the matte white, pink, and soft green colors go on smoothly and are pretty</li>
            <li> I have some issues with muddiness if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> I have some issues with muddiness if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> I am just sorry I waited so long to buy good quality makeup.</li>
            <li> The pink was slightly more subtle than I thought (but computers can&#x27;t be expected to show colours EXACTLY).</li>
            <li> I didnt worry to much about it because other than that the shadows and packaging was unharmedand</li>
            <li> It stays on long and so natural looking!  </li>
            <li> If you are tired of the same old nude or natural eye palette, you should pick this up because it contains natural yet exciting colors.</li>
            <li> Right behind natural eyes and natural matte eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of &amp;#34;neutrals&amp;#34; palettes and this is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s different from others that I have in that it has some fun colors (pink, purple and green) that still work well for a natural look.</li>
            <li> These shadows are very pigmented so you only need to apply a little bit of the product.</li>
            <li> It costs a little  more but lasts a ridiculous amount of time.</li>
            <li> This palette will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did take a long time to deliver</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing the other color sets after trhing this one</li>
            <li> to be harder to work with in terms of fallout.  </li>
            <li> There really is no comparison.</li>
            <li> The palette was not even protected during shipping, for the money I spent</li>
            <li> pat it on very carefully with a firm, flat eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li> The hardest color to work with is Honeymoon due to fall-out.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, I don&#x27;t reach for it as often as some of my other palettes.  </li>
            <li> and this was my first expensive palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the other Too</li>
            <li> I have bought like 3 other sets of this brand.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a matte base, but it&#x27;s really prob a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> The colors last at least the 8 hours I work.</li>
            <li> and you get a lot less fall out</li>
            <li> and I end up with a mess.  </li>
            <li> even I wouldn&#x27;t mess it</li>
            <li> I have modified them a little bit I am not a fan of using eyeshadow as liner.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, the shimmery colors have a little fallout, but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my brother and sister both had weddings in the same year, I knew I needed to step up my game a little.</li>
            <li> A matte green tending towards the lime</li>
            <li> I got the product a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but getting older means having to rethink how you wear your makeup, especially your eye shadow.</li>
            <li> After: A medium brown with small glitter and shimmer</li>
            <li> but I found them hard to follow.  </li>
            <li> Too Faced Cosmetics, Naked Eye Palette, 0.36-ounce]]I think it can look very dramatic or very subtle, depending on the look you are going for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with makeup</li>
            <li> but i found them irrelevant</li>
            <li> To say I am disappointed is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Which I found that to be really annoying considering</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to pay the outrageous prices.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> The color pay off on these shadows is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There are enough colors in the palette to give you lots of options.  I like the too faced shadows.  They are smooth, true colors.  The instruction cards are helpful too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for green eyes</li>
            <li> This was a present for someone.</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying that I love Too Faced products! All and all this palette is a good one, but don&#x27;t let the dark colors fool you because they actually don&#x27;t go on as dark as they look. Would be a good palette to use for a wedding.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It&#x27;s perfect for my fair skin tone, year round.</li>
            <li> This palette has 9 shadows in some very pretty shades.  They are organized along 3 \\&quot;looks\\&quot; - Day, Classic, and Fashion - and come with 3 corresponding looks cards, but you can obviously create your own looks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY&lt;br /&gt;Soulmates:  A pretty peachy beige with a touch of shimmer&lt;br /&gt;I do:  A purple-y mauve&lt;br /&gt;Un-veil: A brownish matte purple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLASSIC&lt;br /&gt;Kiss the bride: light-medium matte pink&lt;br /&gt;Cut the Cake: Shimmery lavender purple&lt;br /&gt;First Dance: Matte eggplant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FASHION&lt;br /&gt;bouquet toss: A matte green tending towards the lime&lt;br /&gt;Honeymoon:  Shimmery metallic gold (this one has glitter)&lt;br /&gt;Ever After: A medium brown with small glitter and shimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite colors in the bunch or Cut the Cake, Honeymoon and Ever After.  When used with primer I get great pigmentation and great blending.  I find the more glittery colors (my 3 favorites!) to be harder to work with in terms of fallout.  I hold a tissue under my eyes when applying so I don&#x27;t end up with glitter on my face.  The hardest color to work with is Honeymoon due to fall-out.  It&#x27;s gorgeous though, so pat it on very carefully with a firm, flat eyeshadow brush (I use the Urban Decay Good Karma - it&#x27;s the one that comes with the Naked Palette) while holding tissue under your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is olive, so purples, as much as I love them, aren&#x27;t the best on me.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with the palette.  I love the Fashion look (with Soulmates as my highlight color) the best.  The classic is lovely too.  First Dance is nice and deep, so that look is great for a purple smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice palette and has a good range of colors.  It&#x27;s probably best suited to people with cool skin tones (I have warm skin tones, which is probably why my best look is the Fashion look).  For this reason, I don&#x27;t reach for it as often as some of my other palettes.  Pigmentation is good, though not QUITE up to the level of Urban Decay.  Same with blending - colors blend well, but not QUITE as well as Urban Decay.  I have some issues with muddiness if I&#x27;m not careful.  Packaging is nice, sturdy, and fairly small, making it ideal for travel.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a brush (no biggie).

            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;- the matte white, pink, and soft green colors go on smoothly and are pretty (these are the large color blocks on the palette)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- the glittery colors crumble easily and get glitter all over your face&lt;br /&gt;- a lot of these colors don&#x27;t work well for warm skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this, but it was just meh... and for the price, it should have been more!</li>
            <li> I think this shadow is just beautiful on. It doesn&#x27;t look so great when you see the pallet in the box, but it really is \\&quot;romantic\\&quot;  when it goes on your eyes. I have very dark hair, dark eyes and am fair skinned.  [[ASIN:B003TNVSTW Too Faced Cosmetics, Naked Eye Palette, 0.36-ounce]]I think it can look very dramatic or very subtle, depending on the look you are going for.  The shadow stays put pretty nicely-usually when I line my lower lashes with shadow it gets in my eyes and irritates them to the point where they tear up and I end up with a mess.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this.  Love these too-faced kits!  I also highly suggest the NAKED EYE.  Very elegant!</li>
            <li> The eye shadows have beautiful pigmentation. i cant wait to try them out on my eyes. The swatches i did looked very soft and pretty. The did blend together when i rubed them on my arm. The case they come in is absolutley gorgeous. Would very much recomend this to anyone trying to get a soft sexy eye. And I love the names of each of the shadows. This is my first Too Faced makeup product as well and I would definitely purchase again when i use them up.</li>
            <li> This is my all time fave go-to makeup kit! The colors glide on smoothly and blend with ease.  Colors are great from day to night to party time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Ordered it in several colors!</li>
            <li> Arrived before time... the colors are beautiful and pigmented...im happy with my purchase  (:</li>
            <li> I love the color combinations and the quality of this product. Good price for the quality. Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I picked this out for my niece and I think she will just love, love, love it!  Received it timely and in perfect condition.  Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a big fan of too faced cosmetics and when I found this a lot more affordable on Amazon, rather than the pricier department stores, I purchased it right away for her birthday. She is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> im new to make up and this was my first expensive palette.&lt;br /&gt;i liked that it came with instruction cards but i found them irrelevant and when i used them, i didnt like the looks.&lt;br /&gt;so i looked up a tutorial and i tried their methods for the looks and they turned out great!&lt;br /&gt;i love the \\&quot;Fashion\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;the shimmery shadows are pretty loose and have tons of fall out.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely palette. The pink was slightly more subtle than I thought (but computers can&#x27;t be expected to show colours EXACTLY). Nevertheless I love this palette and the eye shadows. I use a primer so the colours last all day. I have only begun buying good make up as opposed to drug store brands. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in smoothness and pigmentation. I am just sorry I waited so long to buy good quality makeup. It costs a little  more but lasts a ridiculous amount of time. There really is no comparison. I actually look forward to doing my make up now.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite eyeshadow pallet. The colors last at least the 8 hours I work. The colors are gorgeous too. Pigmentation is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have always used very high end shadows.  Now I do not have to pay the outrageous prices.  This product is wonderful and the little &amp;#34;how to apply cards&amp;#34; that are included are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I have the Natural Eye Palette and love it so much that I wanted to build my Too Faced collection more.  I love this palette, the colors are really versatile and pigmented.  Love!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about purchasing this stop thinking and just take the plunge! The colors in this palette are super wearable, but they are also very unique. If you are tired of the same old nude or natural eye palette, you should pick this up because it contains natural yet exciting colors. The lavender color makes for a beautiful blending color, and the gold is gorgeous. I like the mix of satin, matte and shimmers that this palette contain. I think this palette is a bargain, and it fits a unique niche in the makeup world (nude yet new colors).</li>
            <li> Beautiful pigmentation and color combinations. This is easily a go to palette.</li>
            <li> I had received this product with one of the palette gone...the Honey Moon was everywhere in the box, on my hands.  Very disappointed!!!  I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but getting older means having to rethink how you wear your makeup, especially your eye shadow. Darn those wrinkles! I did some &amp;#34;YouTube&amp;#34; watching to learn how to apply eye shadow again..., as things have changed in the years since I started wearing makeup. Finding the right palette was important because I didn&#x27;t want to draw the wrong kind of &#x27;attention&#x27; to my eyes, due to the above mentioned wrinkles, instead giving them some &#x27;appeal&#x27;. What I really liked about this product is having some &#x27;business cards&#x27; tucking into the case that gives you step-by-step instructions on where to place the eye shadow, color by color. Kind of reminds me of &amp;#34;Painting by Numbers&amp;#34;..., I&#x27;m that old. I wanted to get away from having numerous shadow colors for every color scheme in my wardrobe. I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;look&#x27; is what women in my age group (60&#x27;s) should be wearing these days. The nice thing about the color palette is that you can &#x27;Intensify&#x27; your look by increasing the darker, bolder colors for those times when you&#x27;re whooping it up late at night. Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that my husband was quite pleased with my &#x27;look&#x27;, saying my eye&#x27;s &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; out..., in a good way. Hey, the fact that he noticed was good!&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered some new brushes to go along with the new shadow palette and I feel pretty again.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye shadow pallet. The colors are very beautiful and the colors last all day long. I get compliments on my eyes every time I wear the eye shadows in the palette. I loved this product so much ....I ordered the other Too Faced Cosmetics Eye Shadow Palletes. These shadows are very pigmented so you only need to apply a little bit of the product. This palette will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Ordered for SIL and she loved it.  Zero shipping problems</li>
            <li> I have a lot of &amp;#34;neutrals&amp;#34; palettes and this is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s different from others that I have in that it has some fun colors (pink, purple and green) that still work well for a natural look. I love these Too Faced palettes. They are perfect for palettes and I can either make an easy look by following one of the lines of colors or I can mix and match. The colors blend well and I have experienced very little fall out while applying, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2.</li>
            <li> The color pay off on these shadows is horrible. Packaging super cute but thats all it&#x27;s got going for it.</li>
            <li> liked the way the colors complimented each other.  Wish it came with applicators though.  Box is not meant to carry in purse</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced pallets there are absolutley amazing and they are steal for their price because they give you nine colors that last for a very good amount of time (touch ups never hurt). I am a teen and I have bright green and hazel eyes so this pallet works amazing with my eye color. I LOVE the middle (Purple) colors of the pallet. This is definitaly a pallet worth buying.....but when it was shipped to me the very top left shadow (The cream) was smashed on the top layer so when I opened my package I was greeted with a large swirl of glittery shadow. Now The good part is ... was that there was still a very large amount of the shadow in the pallet so it didnt loose that much. I didnt worry to much about it because other than that the shadows and packaging was unharmedand and I got my brush and instruction cards. Plus I bought this pallet for fourteen dollars so it was a totall steal. Too Faced cosmetics is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I love these colors.  They last forever.  I do however use a primer so that helps too.  I like the color combinations.  It&#x27;s very versatile.  Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is the package is kinda bulky.  The magnetic closure is a plus.  The instructional cards are great.  I have modified them a little bit I am not a fan of using eyeshadow as liner.  I have bought like 3 other sets of this brand.  So no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two years ago. I used it whenever I put makeup on and got a lot of use out of it.  I really like how it came with instructions on how to use the colors and gave me three different looks.  The colors are gorgeous and went well with my fair complexion. I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt some of the shadows did not blend well and creased.  Which I found that to be really annoying considering this is a high end product.  But I love Too Faced and I would repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors, perfect for my brides to be</li>
            <li> I am not big on makeup. When my brother and sister both had weddings in the same year, I knew I needed to step up my game a little. I decided on this palette versus the other similar Too Faced ones because I thought it had the most diversity and most use. I wanted one of these palettes because it came with instructional cards, so even I wouldn&#x27;t mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have bought it, I have used it for going out, weddings, daily makeup, and more. Honestly, this palette is really all I need as far as eyeshadow goes. You can follow the instructions or mix it up and it has always looked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the staying power to be great and the quality is great too. As others have said, the shimmery colors have a little fallout, but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and it has lasted me forever.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette but this is the last time I will be buying makeup from this distributor/amazon as the color I was most looking forward to using is smashed. The palette was not even protected during shipping, for the money I spent I would think they would make sure that the product made it in one piece. To say I am disappointed is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Great colors!  Wish it had a little more staying power. You need to use a primer with it if you want it to last.</li>
            <li> I got the product a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m in love with the colors. I did take a long time to deliver but, hey what can ya do. Plus I love too faced products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this palette! Perfectly matched with cards to show how to do different looks, very good quality and box is larger than looked in picture so I think it will last awhile. Only draw back is it does not come with any applicators but I had a personal set so it wasnt that big of a deal. I will definitely be purchasing the other color sets after trhing this one</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful looks! Get complimented!</li>
            <li> One of the nicer too faced palettes. I really like the colors and you get a lot less fall out/dusting than with some of their others. It would be the third favorite out of all the too faced palettes I own. Right behind natural eyes and natural matte eyes.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette. I like that there are a couple of neutrals Unveiled and I do. I really love Soulmates as a highlight and inner tear duct. My favorite shades are Honeymoon, Cut the Cake, First Dance, and Everafter. I haven&#x27;t really used Kiss the Bride and Bouquet Toss. Kiss the Bride blends into my pinkish skin tone, and Bouquet seems very light on me. I think that I just need to find a way to use those two shades for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase this palette.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eyeshadow palets.  They are good for everyday applications.  Shadow goes on smooth and is very blendable.  Also comes with cards to help you apply the product like a professional.</li>
            <li> Love this palette. I have brown eyes and get a good deal of use out of all of the colors. However, note that there is a LOT of shimmer in the browns. It comes with a matte base, but it&#x27;s really prob a little too much for me. The colors are gorgeous, however, and I like the staying power of the shadows. It&#x27;s close to the staying power of urban decay shadows but not quite there. Still certainly a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Gave to wife for anniversary, she loves it</li>
            <li> My mom owns the matte palette and I love shimmer formulation much, much more so I hope this is the palette for me</li>
            <li> I am older and this eye shadow combo does a wonderful job giving my eyes a more youthful and soft appearance. Will buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;DJW</li>
            <li> Love the color combo that this palette contains. When I received it the top part of the make up palette had came apart from the bottom part which upset me. I was going to return it but instead thru some glue on it and I&#x27;ve been using it since.</li>
            <li> I ordered this romantic eye palette for my wedding. I did my own makeup and it turned out better than if I had paid someone else to apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is AMAZING! I have very fair skin, so I really like the highlighters and the middle row for the crease for a nice eye brightening natural look. This is perfect for everyday use AND special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some matte and some shimmer shadows so you can mix and match according to your outfit, mood, and occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wedding was outside as well as the reception and this eye shadow stayed perfectly in place all day and all  nignt. The consistency is perfect, not too sheer, and not so thick that it cakes up in the creases like cheap brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this for a wedding, I recommend using urban decay eye primer before eyeshadow application. That&#x27;s what I used, and like I said, it lasted all day and night, and the pictures turned out wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as if you bought it in stores. Packing was perfect &amp; I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I will only use too faced eye shadow since discovering it. It stays on long and so natural looking!  I want all eye palettes made.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of their makeuP. Color is so vibrant.</li>
            <li> As usually with Too Faced, it is a perfect palette. I was so happy to find a seller who has it and sends it to Europe! I don&#x27;t regret buying it and recommend this palette, on of my favourites in my collection!</li>
            <li> I got this set and another for a Christmas present from my sister.  I&#x27;m not good with makeup so I thought it would be fun to have something with directions.  It&#x27;s probably just me but I found them hard to follow.  I was hoping for a step by step guide but it&#x27;s a drawn photo of the makeup after you are all done and some instructions.  For a woman who knows what she&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s probably simple but for a novice like me, not so much.  Still, I really love the colors.  They are not colors I have found elsewhere and I love how smoothly they apply.  Not sure if I&#x27;d buy more, but I am glad to have received these for gifts and will use them until they are gone!</li>
