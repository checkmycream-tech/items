            <li>Great item for the price.  </li>
            <li>Used the lotion in Florida and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Because this product basically just has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, I can use it safely, so I&#x27;m happy to know</li>
            <li>It is very effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn, so Solbar Shield did a good job for me</li>
            <li>I chose this one for the good rating it got on the cosmetic database.</li>
            <li>My husband has fair skin and has had skin cancer issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it is good because I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn in Arizona since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It is a good sunscreen and I&#x60;ve been using it, ever since.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>It is also amazingly sweatproof (I don&#x27;t know about its \\&quot;waterproofness\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended this sun screen as the best protection and it works very well.</li>
            <li>When the skin is warm, the product goes on easier (since it&#x27;s a bit thicker).</li>
            <li>It is also nice that my son doesn&#x27;t break out in a rash when he uses Solbar.</li>
            <li>The consistency is good and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with natural sun screen for a while, and this one is one of the best!</li>
            <li>If you want a safe, non-toxic sunscreen (as per EWG ratings) that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, this solbar shield stuff is a must-have.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>I love solbar.</li>
            <li>This product works great to provide long-lasting protection and it is very waterproof.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>Maybe the zinc is better, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>As the product name states - it is more of a shield - it is a thicker, whiter product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it was just okay.</li>
            <li>much better for aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li>have use this product for five years and has given Me the protection I need to be outdoors working in the sun, and enjoying my lakeside home.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist was pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful sunblock, and in my opinion nothing is more effective.</li>
            <li>so you really have to rub it in, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what makes it a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily and is not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>It does get on your clothes easily, so take care not to.</li>
            <li>and I get burnt easily.</li>
            <li>Great sun screen doesn&#x27;t have a white residue as most sun screens of this type</li>
            <li>I feel secure in the sun with this on my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and no greasy.</li>
            <li>This is chemical free and does not burn my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly  and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>It is also PABA Free.</li>
            <li>Solbar Shield is effective enough to save even a skinny-dipping Swede from his own longing to be reborn as a tropical savage.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive and fair skin, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>Good for people, sensitive to PABA.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>Great sun protection recommended by my dermatologist for use in the sun at the beach and during long periods in the sun doing athletic type activities.</li>
            <li>Apparently the two good ingredients are Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide (which are absent in Neutrogena).</li>
            <li>A little more work to apply but great sun block and no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Minimal odor and good absorption makes being in the sun more berable</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a natural, safe sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>This hypoallergenic sunscreen did the trick, and the complaining stopped right away!</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I know how quickly you can cook.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist when my very fair son was complaining about the usual sunscreen burning his skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen she has been able to put on her face that doesn&#x27;t irritate her eyes!</li>
            <li>It is great protection but a little sticky to apply.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off in either fresh or salt water.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I need to be careful in the sun now, and this stuff really works great and lasts even after swimming.  </li>
            <li>Solbar is priced right and it arrived in a timely mannor.</li>
            <li>Solbar Shield might be a very effective sunblock, but I&#x27;ll never know, because my first application left my face so deathly white that I ended up washing it off and using another product instead.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty well...</li>
            <li>He said that since it was not chemically based but a physical barrier it be a better choice for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after looking at many different sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the important part, it works!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the white mask you get with most zinc sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>First tried it from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard is much better.</li>
            <li>I like the product-works just as good as the more expensive product I had been using,  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and does not look too white if you let it sink in.  </li>
            <li>In my  research to find a less messy sun block I discovered that many, including Neutrogena, contain toxic ingredients and do NOT contain good sun blocking ingredients.</li>
            <li>so you can wear it during intense exercise.  </li>
            <li>I feel very protected when wearing this and my Derm Doc.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>But it really protects against the sun rays because it has the titanium on it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well for him.  </li>
            <li>One application will serve for a whole day in the sun, unless you have a British/Irish complexion, in which case two will do.</li>
            <li>This really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Shipping again was fast.  </li>
            <li>Really protects while golfing.</li>
            <li>It protects very well.</li>
            <li>VERY CUTE,,,LOL).&lt;br /&gt;ALL</li>
            <li>Really works at keeping the sun from damaging the skin.</li>
            <li>Solbar Shield is thicker than other sunscreens I have used, but it goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy after it has been absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>skin reaction as itching or burning as many other products</li>
            <li>Went to an outdoor race event in Las Vegas where the sun is very intense and was surprised, NO SUNBURN</li>
            <li>Only caveat I would have, and that goes for most physical sunblocks, is that it takes forever to take off!</li>
            <li>I suppose it is the price you have to pay if you want a decent sunblock for the body.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely buy it again next year.</li>
            <li>As you get older the sun is NOT your friend.</li>
            <li>The design makes it difficult to dispense the lotion as there as more and more is used.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen great blocks out all sun  a little thick but no problem applying cream I have used this sunscreen for several years</li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen because it was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Worked well on light skinned folk in pretty direct southern Mexican sun.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago, I found that I was allergic to some ingredient in most sunscreens, even though I&#x27;m not allergic to anything else that I know of.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on, but, like with all Zinc or Titanium Oxide sun screens, there is a tendency for a white film or residue to be your skin, but that is what all products with physical sun shield properties do...</li>
            <li>I use sun screen because I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>look after I put it on, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for quality sunscreen that has safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>We have been using this for 8 years and completely trust trust this product!</li>
            <li>Also I discovered that high SPF is a hype; SPF above 50 really has no meaning, so an SPF of 100 is nonsense.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy on my face.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually review skin-care products, but I had such good experience with this one on a beach-camping &amp; kayak expedition recently that I want the company to thrive and keep making the stuff.</li>
            <li>I apply it religiously and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with rubbing it in or smell.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and no issue with this sunscreen</li>
            <li>Seems like I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li>He has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this is what my dermatologist advised me to use since I am sensitive to sunblock/sunscreen.</li>
            <li>as a sun  lover,, thru out the years my skin became sensitive, to the sun,, i&#x27;ve tried every sunblock on and off the market.</li>
            <li>appears to be a good screen---wish it was less messy!</li>
            <li>A bit thick, so takes a little extra time to apply but overall I was quite happy making it my main suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>good but a little thick.</li>
            <li>Not pleased- this sunblock usually takes me a good year to use it all.</li>
            <li>If you are a sun worshipper who wants a bronze body this is not for you, but if you like to be protected and have a nice tan...or if you have small children who need serious sun protection, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>It contains no allergens, so if you are sensitive to other suncreens, I highly recommend you give the Solbar Shield a try.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m quite familiar with the need for patient application with zinc oxide sunscreens; I applied only a thin coat and took my time rubbing it in as much as it would go.  </li>

            <li> He said that since it was not chemically based but a physical barrier it be a better choice for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after looking at many different sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the important part, it works!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the white mask you get with most zinc sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> First tried it from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is much better.</li>
            <li> I like the product-works just as good as the more expensive product I had been using,  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and does not look too white if you let it sink in.  </li>
            <li> In my  research to find a less messy sun block I discovered that many, including Neutrogena, contain toxic ingredients and do NOT contain good sun blocking ingredients.</li>
            <li> so you can wear it during intense exercise.  </li>
            <li> I feel very protected when wearing this and my Derm Doc.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> But it really protects against the sun rays because it has the titanium on it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well for him.  </li>
            <li> One application will serve for a whole day in the sun, unless you have a British/Irish complexion, in which case two will do.</li>
            <li> This really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Shipping again was fast.  </li>
            <li> Really protects while golfing.</li>
            <li> It protects very well.</li>
            <li> VERY CUTE,,,LOL).&lt;br /&gt;ALL</li>
            <li> Really works at keeping the sun from damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> Solbar Shield is thicker than other sunscreens I have used, but it goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy after it has been absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> skin reaction as itching or burning as many other products</li>
            <li> Went to an outdoor race event in Las Vegas where the sun is very intense and was surprised, NO SUNBURN</li>
            <li> Only caveat I would have, and that goes for most physical sunblocks, is that it takes forever to take off!</li>
            <li> I suppose it is the price you have to pay if you want a decent sunblock for the body.</li>
            <li> and I will most likely buy it again next year.</li>
            <li> As you get older the sun is NOT your friend.</li>
            <li> The design makes it difficult to dispense the lotion as there as more and more is used.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen great blocks out all sun  a little thick but no problem applying cream I have used this sunscreen for several years</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen because it was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Worked well on light skinned folk in pretty direct southern Mexican sun.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, I found that I was allergic to some ingredient in most sunscreens, even though I&#x27;m not allergic to anything else that I know of.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on, but, like with all Zinc or Titanium Oxide sun screens, there is a tendency for a white film or residue to be your skin, but that is what all products with physical sun shield properties do...</li>
            <li> I use sun screen because I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> look after I put it on, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for quality sunscreen that has safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for 8 years and completely trust trust this product!</li>
            <li> Also I discovered that high SPF is a hype; SPF above 50 really has no meaning, so an SPF of 100 is nonsense.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually review skin-care products, but I had such good experience with this one on a beach-camping &amp; kayak expedition recently that I want the company to thrive and keep making the stuff.</li>
            <li> I apply it religiously and it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no trouble with rubbing it in or smell.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and no issue with this sunscreen</li>
            <li> Seems like I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li> He has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is what my dermatologist advised me to use since I am sensitive to sunblock/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> as a sun  lover,, thru out the years my skin became sensitive, to the sun,, i&#x27;ve tried every sunblock on and off the market.</li>
            <li> appears to be a good screen---wish it was less messy!</li>
            <li> A bit thick, so takes a little extra time to apply but overall I was quite happy making it my main suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> good but a little thick.</li>
            <li> Not pleased- this sunblock usually takes me a good year to use it all.</li>
            <li> If you are a sun worshipper who wants a bronze body this is not for you, but if you like to be protected and have a nice tan...or if you have small children who need serious sun protection, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It contains no allergens, so if you are sensitive to other suncreens, I highly recommend you give the Solbar Shield a try.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m quite familiar with the need for patient application with zinc oxide sunscreens; I applied only a thin coat and took my time rubbing it in as much as it would go.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still looking for a good zinc-based sunscreen for sensitive skin (that doesn&#x27;t have too much CRAP in it)</li>
            <li> I received a sample from the dermatologist and tried it on my face which is extremely sensitive to every other sunscreen product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time until the white film is smeared in and we always have white marks on clothes, the stroller, bags etc...</li>
            <li> I forced myself to use the first bottle, the second remains sealed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty common</li>
            <li> It is hardy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent of baby powder, but it is not unpleasant and is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to put on, kind of thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the white residue, but it&#x27;s not that bad if you rub it in well.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li> In the dry desert I suffer from very dry skin and this product was recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> above no longer works cut the container in half with a box cutter.</li>
            <li> There will be a lot of lotion still left in either half of the container which can be extracted with your finger.</li>
            <li> It has a slight white tinge.</li>
            <li> added later: the only negative thing, and there is a work around, is the container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> and wasted what was left.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and not much smell.  </li>
            <li> i still get a rash from the sun,, but solbar has proven to help the most,,the only drawback is when comming out of the water ,, (the beach or pool).Solbar leaves a thick white patch on my skin.(NOT</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist as other sunscreens would burn my eyes if I accidentally touched my face then rubbed my eyes.  </li>
            <li> We were recommended this by my dermatologist as my kids would break out in rashes and swollen skin when we used other products.</li>
            <li> Way too thick makes me look like I am wearing white face paint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it has the heavy white stuff in it, but is not that hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> It is *much* less smelly than \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and can be difficult to spread on your face, but I don&#x27;t think you need to apply very much of it.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased that this sunscreen was difficult to soak in and left a bluish white film on my skin.</li>
            <li> that is a little easier to apply.</li>
            <li> just apply a tiny amount since it is very thick</li>
            <li> My family dermatologist gave me a sample, told us anything over spf 40 is a waste of time, it&#x27;s in the reapplication, not the strength.</li>
            <li> This only is serious sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It would be a 5 except that it is a bit thick and is not easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended after his bout with a small skin cancer</li>
            <li> This is thicker than the Solbar sunscreen I usually order.  </li>
            <li> I have a tan complexion, so that may be the reason it seemed hard to absorb.</li>
            <li> it dose leave a little bit of a white haze but not to bad</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> There is a big downside though: it is very difficult to apply and we always struggle with our toddler when we put it on him.</li>
            <li> Tough to put on, but works well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores (or make my skin react negatively in any way that I&#x27;ve noticed yet).</li>
            <li> This thick sunscreen doesn&#x27;t sweat off either!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, like zinc oxide, but it works!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> --it is thick and a bit difficult to work into my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I sat through a 3 hour baseball game in oppressive heat, no shade, no breaks, no cloud in the sky, UV levels at 9, but I didn&#x27;t get burnt because I used plenty of Solbar Shield.</li>
            <li> A thin layer does the job.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but does what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When it becomes difficult to squeeze the lotion out take the cap off and tap it repeatedly against your palm of your hand until the desired amount comes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son was having horrible rashes and hives with every other sunscreen we used.</li>
            <li> However, it take sometime to absorb and is not a good make-up base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the product-works just as good as the more expensive product I had been using,  Solbar is priced right and it arrived in a timely mannor.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with natural sun screen for a while, and this one is one of the best! It is pretty easy to apply. However, it take sometime to absorb and is not a good make-up base. It has a slight scent of baby powder, but it is not unpleasant and is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I started using Solbar after my dermatolgist found and removed two melanomas. I apply it religiously and it really works. I like the way it absorbs into my skin and does not leave it feeling greasy. I use it daily. I haven&#x27;t stopped going to my dermatologist but I have not had any further problems.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  But it leaves your skin with a white chalky film.  Unless you are very fair skinned or want to look like a ghost, do not use this on your face.</li>
            <li> If you want a safe, non-toxic sunscreen (as per EWG ratings) that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, this solbar shield stuff is a must-have.  I haven&#x27;t been burned when I put this sunscreen on, even if I&#x27;m in the afternoon sun for a couple hours.  It is also amazingly sweatproof (I don&#x27;t know about its \\&quot;waterproofness\\&quot; since I haven&#x27;t swam with it yet) so you can wear it during intense exercise.  I do have one issue with it that&#x27;s pretty common--it is thick and a bit difficult to work into my skin.  As a consequence, it definitely gives me a \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot; look after I put it on, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for quality sunscreen that has safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. After application  on my face below eye line and upper cheek burned as a result. Saw Dr. immediately and taken off medication. Forget it.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well... It&#x27;s a bit thick and can be difficult to spread on your face, but I don&#x27;t think you need to apply very much of it.  Once its rubbed in and dries, its not oily or greasy at all.  Overall, its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I used the on a trip to AZ when the Temperatures were over 100.  I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn, so Solbar Shield did a good job for me</li>
            <li> In the dry desert I suffer from very dry skin and this product was recommended by dermatologist. It is great protection but a little sticky to apply.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Rubs in easily and is not greasy or oily.  I feel very protected when wearing this and my Derm Doc. loves it also!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...I feel secure in the sun with this on my skin. The consistency is good and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, blocks the rays and stays on even after sweating. Only caveat I would have, and that goes for most physical sunblocks, is that it takes forever to take off! I can rub it off in the bathtub under water but I have to scrub several times with a loofah and/or a body scrub.     I suppose it is the price you have to pay if you want a decent sunblock for the body. There are face sunblocks like Skinceutical or Elta that sell physical sunblock and are easier to wash off, but the prices are unreasonable.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist as other sunscreens would burn my eyes if I accidentally touched my face then rubbed my eyes.  He said that since it was not chemically based but a physical barrier it be a better choice for me.</li>
            <li> My cosmetic dermatology from Kaiser permanente recommended to use it and I really like it. it&#x27;s light and no greasy.</li>
            <li> This is one of 2 products recommended by my dermatologist.  A little more work to apply but great sun block and no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen for my arms. I don&#x27;t use it for my face because it leaves a white shield on it. But it really protects against the sun rays because it has the titanium on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after looking at many different sunscreens.  I chose this one for the good rating it got on the cosmetic database. I&#x27;ve had no trouble with rubbing it in or smell.  It does get on your clothes easily, so take care not to. Works well and I will most likely buy it again next year.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems getting it to rub in.  It is *much* less smelly than \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; sunscreens.  And it&#x27;s a natural, safe sunscreen!  Lastly, the important part, it works!  No sunburn on this pale-skinned user.    October 2010 update: My mom bought this product after trying mine.  It&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen she has been able to put on her face that doesn&#x27;t irritate her eyes!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist when my very fair son was complaining about the usual sunscreen burning his skin.  This hypoallergenic sunscreen did the trick, and the complaining stopped right away!</li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended after his bout with a small skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;it went on great and did an excellent job&lt;br /&gt;no  redness or burns!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen great blocks out all sun  a little thick but no problem applying cream I have used this sunscreen for several years it dose leave a little bit of a white haze but not to bad I also have sensitive skin and no issue with this sunscreen</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this sun screen as the best protection and it works very well. It seems to be great protection, we have never had a sun burn. There is a big downside though: it is very difficult to apply and we always struggle with our toddler when we put it on him. It takes a long time until the white film is smeared in and we always have white marks on clothes, the stroller, bags etc... It also leaves a shiny film on the face (and causes greasy hair around the face) so I would not recommend it for adults who mind this...</li>
            <li> This solbar product provides excellent sun screen protection; won&#x27;t wash off while in the water.  Has no odor.  A great product.</li>
            <li> My husband has fair skin and has had skin cancer issues.  This product works very well for him.  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This is chemical free and does not burn my skin.  If I sweat a lot, I have gotten it in my eyes and it does sting a tiny bit, but nothing like standard products, it&#x27;s a fleeting annoyance.  Expensive, but does what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try and used it as directed. Went to an outdoor race event in Las Vegas where the sun is very intense and was surprised, NO SUNBURN I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom. She loves it. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Solbar Shield is effective enough to save even a skinny-dipping Swede from his own longing to be reborn as a tropical savage. It doesn&#x27;t smell! It doesn&#x27;t wash off in either fresh or salt water. It doesn&#x27;t melt into your sweat and sting your eyes. One application will serve for a whole day in the sun, unless you have a British/Irish complexion, in which case two will do. What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually review skin-care products, but I had such good experience with this one on a beach-camping &amp; kayak expedition recently that I want the company to thrive and keep making the stuff. Besides, although global warming will not lengthen the hours of sunlight, it will strengthen the urge to take off your shirt and wear shorts.</li>
            <li> appears to be a good screen---wish it was less messy!</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen.  I use it ever day rain or shine.  This is my second bottle.  One bottle last a year for me.  Now I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on well. I like it because after about 30 minutes the lotion disappears. You don&#x27;t walk around with this zinc oxide look or baby skin lotion look. I&#x27;ve had pre-cancerous things removed from my arms. This stuff has kept these things at bay. It&#x27;s the best water resistant stuff I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Sunblock is going to be out of date in October 2014. Seems like I got an old bottle. Not pleased- this sunblock usually takes me a good year to use it all.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Goes on easy and does not look too white if you let it sink in.  Physical blocks - zinc and titanium dioxide are the only way to go.</li>
            <li> Never, ever makes me break out, which is saying a lot for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful sunblock, and in my opinion nothing is more effective. Its going to make you look white as a ghost, but if you don&#x27;t care about that and just want to avoid getting burnt, this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat through a 3 hour baseball game in oppressive heat, no shade, no breaks, no cloud in the sky, UV levels at 9, but I didn&#x27;t get burnt because I used plenty of Solbar Shield. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I love solbar. I have a lot of skin issues like allergies and I get burnt easily. Solbar is great for my skin and protects me from the sun. This thick sunscreen doesn&#x27;t sweat off either!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I received a sample from the dermatologist and tried it on my face which is extremely sensitive to every other sunscreen product that I have tried. This product works great to provide long-lasting protection and it is very waterproof. It contains no allergens, so if you are sensitive to other suncreens, I highly recommend you give the Solbar Shield a try.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended....</li>
            <li> good but a little thick. I would prefer that it would be in a smaller tube that&#x27;s easier to carry.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend&#x27;s dermatologist. It is very effective.  If there is a 4.5 rating, I would use that.  It would be a 5 except that it is a bit thick and is not easily absorbed. Definitely will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but well worth the money. As you get older the sun is NOT your friend. Great for golfers, tennis players and surfers.  It is hardy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the white mask you get with most zinc sunscreens.  This really absorbs into the skin.  I am allergic to the chemicals in sunscreen and had problems with my face swelling.  My dermatologist suggested using only zinc and titanium dioxide, both of which are the ingredients in Solbar Shield.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist........it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I carry it in my running bag and on business trips as well.</li>
            <li> Great delivery. Love the product</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is thicker than the Solbar sunscreen I usually order.  It&#x27;s like it has the heavy white stuff in it, but is not that hard to rub in.  I will keep it  though.  Maybe the zinc is better, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> My son was having horrible rashes and hives with every other sunscreen we used. This only is serious sunscreen! I ended up using it on myself last summer and and not once did I get burned. It&#x27;s a little hard to put on, kind of thick so you really have to rub it in, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what makes it a good sunscreen. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for 8 years and completely trust trust this product! When I apply this to my very fair skinned children, I can rest assure my children will not burn. We were recommended this by my dermatologist as my kids would break out in rashes and swollen skin when we used other products. It does take a bit longer to put this cream on but we don&#x27;t mind since we get piece of mind from using it.</li>
            <li> My family dermatologist gave me a sample, told us anything over spf 40 is a waste of time, it&#x27;s in the reapplication, not the strength. Could not find it locally, ordered it here. Went to the beach, my son and I were the only two of the family who used it and the only two who came home with a tan and not a burn. It&#x27;s thick, like zinc oxide, but it works! So well we were in the water, sun, and a stong breeze for five hours, reapplying as needed, without shade. If you are a sun worshipper who wants a bronze body this is not for you, but if you like to be protected and have a nice tan...or if you have small children who need serious sun protection, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, but, like with all Zinc or Titanium Oxide sun screens, there is a tendency for a white film or residue to be your skin, but that is what all products with physical sun shield properties do...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. Made my skin look like a vampire. I forced myself to use the first bottle, the second remains sealed.</li>
            <li> I need to be careful in the sun now, and this stuff really works great and lasts even after swimming.  First tried it from the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for. 30 days and no sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly  and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;No skin reaction as itching or burning as many other products</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen for my son who is allergic to all chemical sunscreens.  Solbar Shield works wonderfully and my son has no allergies to it.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price.  Shipping again was fast.  Used the lotion in Florida and it worked great.  Doctor recommended it for my wife.  THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> Really protects while golfing.</li>
            <li> My son loves it. He has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product, in the family of Solbar products, is a bit thicker sunscreen. As the product name states - it is more of a shield - it is a thicker, whiter product. But it&#x27;s excellent for using by the pool or water. It protects very well. When the skin is warm, the product goes on easier (since it&#x27;s a bit thicker).</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended SPF and my husband uses it daily for surfing.</li>
            <li> I use sun screen because I live in Arizona and I know how quickly you can cook. It is also nice that my son doesn&#x27;t break out in a rash when he uses Solbar.</li>
            <li> This product was hightly recommended to us by our dermatologist.  We have recommended it to our daughter-in-law who lives in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased that this sunscreen was difficult to soak in and left a bluish white film on my skin. I have a tan complexion, so that may be the reason it seemed hard to absorb. Otherwise, it was just okay. At least it didn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen because it was highly recommended by my dermatologist. I have very fair skin, and I have to wear a sunscreen on my face every day. Solbar Shield is thicker than other sunscreens I have used, but it goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy after it has been absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way. It makes my face feel softer and I don&#x27;t need to add any additional moisturizer when I use it. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> The best protection I have found.</li>
            <li> Way too thick makes me look like I am wearing white face paint. It does work well though, I just use it on my arms instead of face.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m not allergic to.  For that reason, I love it!!!  It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection recommended by my dermatologist for use in the sun at the beach and during long periods in the sun doing athletic type activities.</li>
            <li> Solbar Shield might be a very effective sunblock, but I&#x27;ll never know, because my first application left my face so deathly white that I ended up washing it off and using another product instead.  Mind you, I&#x27;m quite familiar with the need for patient application with zinc oxide sunscreens; I applied only a thin coat and took my time rubbing it in as much as it would go.  Despite what you might expect based on the Z-Cote HP1 marketing claims, this sunscreen just doesn&#x27;t disappear.  I find [[ASIN:B000ZJ2842 Vanicream SPF 30]] much better for aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li> The vendor provided me with a bottle too close to the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy and does not absorb well into the skin.  Blue Lizard is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it is good because I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn in Arizona since I started using it.</li>
            <li> this is what my dermatologist advised me to use since I am sensitive to sunblock/sunscreen. works for me. just apply a tiny amount since it is very thick</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen with SPF 40.  It is lightweight, spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> I was using Nuetrogena 100. Neutrogena would get on the interior of rental cars and once I was charged an extra $150 for cleaning. In my  research to find a less messy sun block I discovered that many, including Neutrogena, contain toxic ingredients and do NOT contain good sun blocking ingredients. Apparently the two good ingredients are Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide (which are absent in Neutrogena). Also I discovered that high SPF is a hype; SPF above 50 really has no meaning, so an SPF of 100 is nonsense. I chose Solbar Shield Sunscreen SPF 40 because it has the two needed ingredients and has no toxins, AND it does not cause the staining problem that Neutrogena did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note added later: the only negative thing, and there is a work around, is the container. The design makes it difficult to dispense the lotion as there as more and more is used. The work around is:&lt;br /&gt;1. When it becomes difficult to squeeze the lotion out take the cap off and tap it repeatedly against your palm of your hand until the desired amount comes out.&lt;br /&gt;2. When 1. above no longer works cut the container in half with a box cutter. There will be a lot of lotion still left in either half of the container which can be extracted with your finger. I used to throw it out after 1. and wasted what was left.</li>
            <li> Tough to put on, but works well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores (or make my skin react negatively in any way that I&#x27;ve noticed yet). I&#x27;d buy it again. But I&#x27;m still looking for a good zinc-based sunscreen for sensitive skin (that doesn&#x27;t have too much CRAP in it) that is a little easier to apply.</li>
            <li> ive been using Solbar for 2 years now..as a sun  lover,, thru out the years my skin became sensitive, to the sun,, i&#x27;ve tried every sunblock on and off the market.Solbar has been the best..i still get a rash from the sun,, but solbar has proven to help the most,,the only drawback is when comming out of the water ,, (the beach or pool).Solbar leaves a thick white patch on my skin.(NOT VERY CUTE,,,LOL).&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL ITS STILL GIVES ME THE BEST PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;ANNA</li>
            <li> Having sensitive and fair skin, I recommend this. I was given a sample of it from a Dermatologist wife. It was among, several things in a gift basket. It is also PABA Free. Good for people, sensitive to PABA. It is a good sunscreen and I&#x60;ve been using it, ever since.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. A thin layer does the job. I use it on my eyelids &amp; it stays on even when I&#x27;m sweating. It has a slight white tinge. Rub it in well.</li>
            <li> Worked well on light skinned folk in pretty direct southern Mexican sun.  Not too greasy and not much smell.  A bit thick, so takes a little extra time to apply but overall I was quite happy making it my main suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> This product gives needed pertection from UV damage working outside in the sun.  Boating, Mowing lawn, and working in the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;I have use this product for five years and has given Me the protection I need to be outdoors working in the sun, and enjoying my lakeside home.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  Minimal odor and good absorption makes being in the sun more berable</li>
            <li> Needs to be rubbed in a bit, but provides a great base for makeup. My skin is on the dry side so I like the creaminess of this product. Been in sunshine on &amp; off all day and no redness.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the products based on a referral from her dermatologist. I like the zinc oxide for the face. Really works at keeping the sun from damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I found that I was allergic to some ingredient in most sunscreens, even though I&#x27;m not allergic to anything else that I know of.  Because this product basically just has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, I can use it safely, so I&#x27;m happy to know I can always re-order it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Very good sun screen which I used at the Gulf. My dermatologist was pleased.</li>
            <li> Definitely works. I don&#x27;t love the white residue, but it&#x27;s not that bad if you rub it in well.</li>
            <li> Great sun screen doesn&#x27;t have a white residue as most sun screens of this type</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen without the chemicals!</li>
