            <li>I tried this product and got good results.</li>
            <li>Even she had good results.</li>
            <li>You need to exfoliate with a good multi-hydroxy acid, build collagen with retinoids, and protect with a good anti-oxidant.</li>
            <li>The lather is just right, it has a pleasant scent, and the size is perfect.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing after using these.</li>
            <li>kind of exfoliates while cleaning....</li>
            <li>I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to see the change forming.  </li>
            <li>I have my own creams that I like but</li>
            <li>The disks are a nice size.</li>
            <li>Did lather nicely and stay moist though.</li>
            <li>The disks foam up nicely</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to see anything miraculous happen, BUT it keeps it looking really excellent!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap, but my skin looks good when I use this so no complaints from me.</li>
            <li>Like with most OTC skin care products, I took their claims with a grain of salt and hoped for the best, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>These are good to clean skin.</li>
            <li>Product is very good &amp; give your face a fresh clean feel and look.</li>
            <li>These are heaven sent for a Mom of many.</li>
            <li>However, I was trying to use them at the same time as I was using some of the very excellent ROC products with Retinol</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I was able to use it on my face, shoulders and neck.</li>
            <li>Love all Roc products.</li>
            <li>one more thing...</li>
            <li>pleased with the resuults</li>
            <li>I love ROC products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so glad I found this product here</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li>seems to be safe, and I have had alergetic reactions to a lot of products.</li>
            <li>But my girl friend love it</li>
            <li>Love these....</li>
            <li>I love these resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember how many times I repurchased this product.</li>
            <li>The company sure didn&#x27;t scrimp on the quality of the discs.</li>
            <li>My granddaughters used to tell me, &amp;#34;grandma, how come you have so many wrinkles?&amp;#34; Talk about hurt.</li>
            <li>Great product been using the whole line for 5 years now..</li>
            <li>love it .....</li>
            <li>love the disks....</li>
            <li>It just seems more convenient.  </li>
            <li>, so even better.  </li>
            <li>A clay face mask will do a better job on pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these disks.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was not as satisfied with any of them and returned to ROC.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after use and how I look in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Try this at your discretion and be safe with doing so.</li>
            <li>Better yet...</li>
            <li>My skin seems softer, with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>NICE TO CLEAN THE FACE.</li>
            <li>if you face is fairly clean,a lot of product in pad,but felt my face was nice and soft after using,I recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li>I love that they foam up so well and are easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>The smooth side is a good cleanser,the rough side is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I loved how my skin felt and looked afterward and wanted to try to achieve those results with an OTC product that was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick, and easy!</li>
            <li>they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the way the pads are contoured for easy use around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price;  I&#x27;ll know more as I continue to use it longer.  </li>
            <li>Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in fine lines, but I do notice a difference in my pores.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why the claim is reduces the &amp;#34;APPEARANCE&amp;#34; of fine lines as opposed to reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>Make my skin softer and soften fine lines and wrinkles immediatly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles appear to be lessening also, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the change is huge.  </li>
            <li>I have had these for about 5 days now and already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>like I see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>my face feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works great, bought in stores prior, getting it online just makes it easier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these resurfacing disks for a couple of years because they were coming free in the package when I bought another Roc product.</li>
            <li>Seem to remove bacteria, light makeup on skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>i love ROC products but this one didnt work as great as i expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S Always have some kind of eye wash near when using any of the RocC  products, as you&#x27;ll never know when you many get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Price seems right for this many.</li>
            <li>ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks are very effective at removing scaly skin cells from brown age spots.</li>
            <li>I used the smooth side to clean my eyes and it didn&#x27;t make me tear up like</li>
            <li>Originally, my husband purchased them for himself, but ended up not liking them.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>i clean my face with this every night...</li>
            <li>Your skin will fell so clean after using one.</li>
            <li>These clean the skin well without feeling stripped.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Using sugar grains mixed with a tad of warm water does a better job at exfoliating and is practically free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I clean my neck as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I&#x27;ll tell you that despite the lack of \\&quot;scientific\\&quot; reason, they do most certainly seem to work, and I have been well-pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Had a good larger, leaves face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure how they got it here that fast.</li>
            <li>So if you can get these free with another product, like I have, they&#x27;re worth using, since they do cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>you get a good facial cleaning.  </li>
            <li>this really is one of the better products.</li>
            <li>In any case rice  your face with cool water after use.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Roc&#x27;s eye treatment with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Daily Resurfacing Disks.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with it and will continue to use it for a few months to see if there are more changes.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clearer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>At age 59+, I&#x27;m always in search of the next best thing in facial treatments.</li>
            <li>I do use these in conjunction with the ROC evening retinol cream but right out of the shower my face feels super clean with just the pads alone.</li>
            <li>Left my skin super soft and good for eliminating break outs!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these pads I only use them once a week</li>
            <li>In the meantime, these &amp;#34;resurfacing disks&amp;#34; are easy to use and cover a large area.  </li>
            <li>Love all the ROC products, the resurfacing disks make your face feel like a new born baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Lather nicely and are plenty big.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The pads foam up nicely and definitely get all the makeup off my face  -</li>
            <li>This leaves a fresh surfaace for cream or makeup.</li>
            <li>these disks are an easy way to keep skin soft &amp; clean.  &amp; exfoliated.</li>
            <li>For the price, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I continued to use for a couple more weeks, hoping this was due to the change in skincare routine, but it never got any better.  </li>
            <li>I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away</li>
            <li>I am especially impressed with the Daily Resurfacing Disks I use them as least once a day (mostly for my evening regime in conjunction with the night cream) and within a couple of weeks, my face was smooth, free from pimples and my dreaded deep wrinkle, at the corner of my mouth, was diminishing.</li>
            <li>when i saw it on amazon i picked it up right away.</li>
            <li>I thought a lot of reviews on here were exaggerated, but I can honestly say that I loved the way my skin looked after the very first use.</li>
            <li>it a try, and you will most definitely see the results -- and pretty darned quickly at that.</li>
            <li>So handy to use when you don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole washcloth, cleansing cream thing, and I feel as if it really deep cleans.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using these regularly, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my fine &amp;#34;expression&amp;#34; lines around my eyes and forehead!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE and can definitely see a difference in the depth and size of my pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much!  </li>
            <li>I think you will really like them!.</li>
            <li>could tell a noticeable difference after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I came back and am glad.  </li>
            <li>I could use it more often, but it isn&#x27;t part of my daily habit.</li>
            <li>I ordered these Roc Disks and the first order arrived after most of the fluid had leaked in the shipping box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried these and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li>i notice a difference the first week.</li>
            <li>I was pleased enough that I reordered before I ran out.</li>
            <li>Love the exfoliating side of them especially.</li>
            <li>The disks are larger than most.</li>
            <li>have always had GREAT skin, so honestly it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li>If you want to reduce lines, the most clinically proven ingredient on the planet is retinoids (such as retin-A, tretinoin, etc.).</li>
            <li>Of course, someone I had not seen in a few months just saw me today and said I looked really good, so perhaps this item has helped me.  </li>
            <li>Roc products work well for me for mature but still oily fair skin that is not sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, use the soft smooth side, and remember to use it gently.</li>
            <li>After using them my skin felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 40+ years old, spent my share of time in tanning salons (in the 80&#x27;s) and have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It is also pricey, but the disks are so huge that you can easily cut them in half and still have plenty of product to use if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li>These keep your face fresh but not don&#x27;t expect dermabrasion sloughing, but they really clean your skin deeply.</li>
            <li>My face feels super soft after using these</li>
            <li>I agree the pads are large, but I don&#x27;t cut them.</li>
            <li>I use other Roc products for diminishing wrinkles &amp; dark spots; they are more effective than these disks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this product a high rating even though I&#x27;m just finishing the first container of disks.</li>
            <li>These are really soapy</li>
            <li>I really like them, though.  </li>
            <li>It is very sudsy</li>
            <li>Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side is not so gentle</li>
            <li>These are fabulous for daily exfoliation!</li>
            <li>I really recommend incorporating this product into your skin care regime.     </li>
            <li>works very well...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days (and like others have said, use just 1/2 pad each day which is plenty), and I am really seeing a difference already in skin tone.</li>
            <li>They have a somewhat chemical scent (even after rinsing) that I don&#x27;t care too much for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 and my skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I have always taken great care of my skin, and tried so many expensive different cleansers, but they just did not fill the bill.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it, looks like I will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>This works well for me, but I use it maybe 4-5 days a week-every day was too much.</li>
            <li>but very soapy</li>
            <li>The smooth side is for cleansing and the opposite &amp;#34;nubbier&amp;#34; side is designed for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, as far as I can see, I&#x27;ve purchased a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; in a jar, and I will most definitely purchase it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>I am 42 so am battling fine lines and huge pores along with dry skin that used to be oily in my younger years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is old or new only that it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>This product is superior as far as cleansing,I don&#x27;t like to use cleansers,they are usually greasy but this product is not at all.</li>
            <li>If you get too much irritation, then only use it every other day as your skin is not used to this kind of cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am an older guy and wanted something to help with maintaining wrinkles and over all skin care.</li>
            <li>Their skin has cleared up considerably and I feel like my skin is lightly exfoliated daily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend you try these disks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, in my 40s, combo skin type, DRAMATIC improvement in my skin, pores smaller, skin about 300% smoother, lines diminished</li>
            <li>After only a week or so of using them, I haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference in how my skin looks, but it definitely feels scrubbed clean without any irritation - which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The soft side is gentle and creamy making your face feel silky.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be surprised on how much cleanser remains in that disc.</li>
            <li>I use the soft side to soap up my face and neck, then I use the rougher side to gently scrub and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates old skin making face lighter and feel softer.</li>
            <li>Love these and use them everyday.</li>
            <li>If you are someone with normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>these are a nice, thick cleansing pad; they are not abrasive (for me) at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping based on other reviews that with continued use, I will see fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;m right back</li>
            <li>Roc Daily Resurfacing disks leave the skin soft and smooth like no other.</li>
            <li>Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face</li>
            <li>One side of the pad is smooth and the other is nubby-</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in wrinkles or other miraculous changes, but my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like it because my skin feels clean and not too tight.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these, and if you find that your face is a bit dry right after using them, just follow it up with a moisturizer or olive oil.  </li>
            <li>so they last longer, If its you first time useing AHA products begin with 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell if they&#x27;re reducing fine lines, but I like the way they lather up and cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>but this was true only for my facial area skin.</li>
            <li>Product arrived from vendor quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>There are far cheaper ways to clean skin than using these disks (Cetaphyl, other inexpensive cleansers, alcohol based toners, etc).</li>
            <li>one half was enough for face, neck, top of hands and arms.</li>
            <li>The disks are supposed to clean, and diminish wrinkles and dark spots, as well as to exfoliate a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One review indicated it was an old product and that concerned me.  </li>
            <li>(Early 30&#x27;s here).</li>
            <li>I even rub it under my arms to get rid of the old deodorant build up that happens.</li>
            <li>My face does feel extremely soft immediately.  </li>
            <li>I use these morning and night because i like to have NO dead skin on my face that the makeup can cling to.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how foamy these were and not sandpapery at all.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The disks have no effect on the size of pores, as stated in the description, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I follow up with a moisturizer and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I recommended the to my 30 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-20s, you HAVE to start young.</li>
            <li>face is sensitive but, this product did not give me no problem.</li>
            <li>Too early to see the impact on the face from using it...</li>
            <li>If you have anything close to sensitive skin......</li>
            <li>if you are very sensitive use smooth side or only slight pressure  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I was not able to find Organic or even natural alternative to this, but still it&#x27;s the best for what it does.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ll tell you that there is no scientific reason to prove that ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks actually work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side really earns its name, and the soothing moisturizing side really calms it down</li>
            <li>If your make up is heavy, you may need a whole one or use at least an eye make up remover product on a cotton pad or wash cloth first then a 1/2 pad will be fine.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I feel that one pad cut in half more than suffices, so these should last me twice as long.  </li>
            <li>These disks are more than ample for the average face, so I cut them in half</li>
            <li>and they were a little too powerful in combination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last a long time, esp since I cut the large disks in half.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of texture to feel like you are actually exfoliating your skin on one side and a softer feel to the other side.  </li>
            <li>They are large and very wet and sudsy and require rinsing with water or in my case, I use the shea baby wipes to rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li>i usually see results in as quick as a week, but ive had this for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>The other side gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li>and they deep clean without making my skin tight or dry.  </li>
            <li>I just received my product a few days ago, two days ago to be exact.  </li>
            <li>First couple of times used I broke out, but I think it was the trapped oils moving to the surface.</li>
            <li>The disks are large, so I cut them in half.</li>
            <li>With little effort, you can find this item at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I would try some other new products on the market.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing after using these.</li>
            <li> kind of exfoliates while cleaning....</li>
            <li> I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to see the change forming.  </li>
            <li> I have my own creams that I like but</li>
            <li> The disks are a nice size.</li>
            <li> Did lather nicely and stay moist though.</li>
            <li> The disks foam up nicely</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to see anything miraculous happen, BUT it keeps it looking really excellent!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap, but my skin looks good when I use this so no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Like with most OTC skin care products, I took their claims with a grain of salt and hoped for the best, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> These are good to clean skin.</li>
            <li> Product is very good &amp; give your face a fresh clean feel and look.</li>
            <li> These are heaven sent for a Mom of many.</li>
            <li> However, I was trying to use them at the same time as I was using some of the very excellent ROC products with Retinol</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I was able to use it on my face, shoulders and neck.</li>
            <li> Love all Roc products.</li>
            <li> one more thing...</li>
            <li> pleased with the resuults</li>
            <li> I love ROC products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so glad I found this product here</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> seems to be safe, and I have had alergetic reactions to a lot of products.</li>
            <li> But my girl friend love it</li>
            <li> Love these....</li>
            <li> I love these resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how many times I repurchased this product.</li>
            <li> The company sure didn&#x27;t scrimp on the quality of the discs.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters used to tell me, &amp;#34;grandma, how come you have so many wrinkles?&amp;#34; Talk about hurt.</li>
            <li> Great product been using the whole line for 5 years now..</li>
            <li> love it .....</li>
            <li> love the disks....</li>
            <li> It just seems more convenient.  </li>
            <li> , so even better.  </li>
            <li> A clay face mask will do a better job on pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these disks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was not as satisfied with any of them and returned to ROC.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after use and how I look in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Try this at your discretion and be safe with doing so.</li>
            <li> Better yet...</li>
            <li> My skin seems softer, with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> NICE TO CLEAN THE FACE.</li>
            <li> if you face is fairly clean,a lot of product in pad,but felt my face was nice and soft after using,I recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li> I love that they foam up so well and are easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> The smooth side is a good cleanser,the rough side is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I loved how my skin felt and looked afterward and wanted to try to achieve those results with an OTC product that was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Quick, and easy!</li>
            <li> they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the way the pads are contoured for easy use around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price;  I&#x27;ll know more as I continue to use it longer.  </li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in fine lines, but I do notice a difference in my pores.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why the claim is reduces the &amp;#34;APPEARANCE&amp;#34; of fine lines as opposed to reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> Make my skin softer and soften fine lines and wrinkles immediatly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles appear to be lessening also, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the change is huge.  </li>
            <li> I have had these for about 5 days now and already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> like I see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> my face feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works great, bought in stores prior, getting it online just makes it easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these resurfacing disks for a couple of years because they were coming free in the package when I bought another Roc product.</li>
            <li> Seem to remove bacteria, light makeup on skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> i love ROC products but this one didnt work as great as i expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S Always have some kind of eye wash near when using any of the RocC  products, as you&#x27;ll never know when you many get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Price seems right for this many.</li>
            <li> ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks are very effective at removing scaly skin cells from brown age spots.</li>
            <li> I used the smooth side to clean my eyes and it didn&#x27;t make me tear up like</li>
            <li> Originally, my husband purchased them for himself, but ended up not liking them.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> i clean my face with this every night...</li>
            <li> Your skin will fell so clean after using one.</li>
            <li> These clean the skin well without feeling stripped.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Using sugar grains mixed with a tad of warm water does a better job at exfoliating and is practically free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I clean my neck as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I&#x27;ll tell you that despite the lack of \\&quot;scientific\\&quot; reason, they do most certainly seem to work, and I have been well-pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Had a good larger, leaves face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  </li>
            <li> Not even sure how they got it here that fast.</li>
            <li> So if you can get these free with another product, like I have, they&#x27;re worth using, since they do cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> you get a good facial cleaning.  </li>
            <li> this really is one of the better products.</li>
            <li> In any case rice  your face with cool water after use.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Roc&#x27;s eye treatment with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Daily Resurfacing Disks.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with it and will continue to use it for a few months to see if there are more changes.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> At age 59+, I&#x27;m always in search of the next best thing in facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I do use these in conjunction with the ROC evening retinol cream but right out of the shower my face feels super clean with just the pads alone.</li>
            <li> Left my skin super soft and good for eliminating break outs!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these pads I only use them once a week</li>
            <li> In the meantime, these &amp;#34;resurfacing disks&amp;#34; are easy to use and cover a large area.  </li>
            <li> Love all the ROC products, the resurfacing disks make your face feel like a new born baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Lather nicely and are plenty big.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The pads foam up nicely and definitely get all the makeup off my face  -</li>
            <li> This leaves a fresh surfaace for cream or makeup.</li>
            <li> these disks are an easy way to keep skin soft &amp; clean.  &amp; exfoliated.</li>
            <li> For the price, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I continued to use for a couple more weeks, hoping this was due to the change in skincare routine, but it never got any better.  </li>
            <li> I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away</li>
            <li> I am especially impressed with the Daily Resurfacing Disks I use them as least once a day (mostly for my evening regime in conjunction with the night cream) and within a couple of weeks, my face was smooth, free from pimples and my dreaded deep wrinkle, at the corner of my mouth, was diminishing.</li>
            <li> when i saw it on amazon i picked it up right away.</li>
            <li> I thought a lot of reviews on here were exaggerated, but I can honestly say that I loved the way my skin looked after the very first use.</li>
            <li> it a try, and you will most definitely see the results -- and pretty darned quickly at that.</li>
            <li> So handy to use when you don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole washcloth, cleansing cream thing, and I feel as if it really deep cleans.  </li>
            <li> Once I started using these regularly, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my fine &amp;#34;expression&amp;#34; lines around my eyes and forehead!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE and can definitely see a difference in the depth and size of my pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much!  </li>
            <li> I think you will really like them!.</li>
            <li> could tell a noticeable difference after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I came back and am glad.  </li>
            <li> I could use it more often, but it isn&#x27;t part of my daily habit.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Roc Disks and the first order arrived after most of the fluid had leaked in the shipping box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried these and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li> i notice a difference the first week.</li>
            <li> I was pleased enough that I reordered before I ran out.</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating side of them especially.</li>
            <li> The disks are larger than most.</li>
            <li> have always had GREAT skin, so honestly it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li> If you want to reduce lines, the most clinically proven ingredient on the planet is retinoids (such as retin-A, tretinoin, etc.).</li>
            <li> Of course, someone I had not seen in a few months just saw me today and said I looked really good, so perhaps this item has helped me.  </li>
            <li> Roc products work well for me for mature but still oily fair skin that is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, use the soft smooth side, and remember to use it gently.</li>
            <li> After using them my skin felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 40+ years old, spent my share of time in tanning salons (in the 80&#x27;s) and have fair skin.  </li>
            <li> It is also pricey, but the disks are so huge that you can easily cut them in half and still have plenty of product to use if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li> These keep your face fresh but not don&#x27;t expect dermabrasion sloughing, but they really clean your skin deeply.</li>
            <li> My face feels super soft after using these</li>
            <li> I agree the pads are large, but I don&#x27;t cut them.</li>
            <li> I use other Roc products for diminishing wrinkles &amp; dark spots; they are more effective than these disks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a high rating even though I&#x27;m just finishing the first container of disks.</li>
            <li> These are really soapy</li>
            <li> I really like them, though.  </li>
            <li> It is very sudsy</li>
            <li> Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is not so gentle</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for daily exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I really recommend incorporating this product into your skin care regime.     </li>
            <li> works very well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days (and like others have said, use just 1/2 pad each day which is plenty), and I am really seeing a difference already in skin tone.</li>
            <li> They have a somewhat chemical scent (even after rinsing) that I don&#x27;t care too much for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and my skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have always taken great care of my skin, and tried so many expensive different cleansers, but they just did not fill the bill.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it, looks like I will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> This works well for me, but I use it maybe 4-5 days a week-every day was too much.</li>
            <li> but very soapy</li>
            <li> The smooth side is for cleansing and the opposite &amp;#34;nubbier&amp;#34; side is designed for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, as far as I can see, I&#x27;ve purchased a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; in a jar, and I will most definitely purchase it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I am 42 so am battling fine lines and huge pores along with dry skin that used to be oily in my younger years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is old or new only that it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This product is superior as far as cleansing,I don&#x27;t like to use cleansers,they are usually greasy but this product is not at all.</li>
            <li> If you get too much irritation, then only use it every other day as your skin is not used to this kind of cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am an older guy and wanted something to help with maintaining wrinkles and over all skin care.</li>
            <li> Their skin has cleared up considerably and I feel like my skin is lightly exfoliated daily.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend you try these disks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair, in my 40s, combo skin type, DRAMATIC improvement in my skin, pores smaller, skin about 300% smoother, lines diminished</li>
            <li> After only a week or so of using them, I haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference in how my skin looks, but it definitely feels scrubbed clean without any irritation - which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The soft side is gentle and creamy making your face feel silky.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be surprised on how much cleanser remains in that disc.</li>
            <li> I use the soft side to soap up my face and neck, then I use the rougher side to gently scrub and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates old skin making face lighter and feel softer.</li>
            <li> Love these and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are someone with normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> these are a nice, thick cleansing pad; they are not abrasive (for me) at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping based on other reviews that with continued use, I will see fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;m right back</li>
            <li> Roc Daily Resurfacing disks leave the skin soft and smooth like no other.</li>
            <li> Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face</li>
            <li> One side of the pad is smooth and the other is nubby-</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in wrinkles or other miraculous changes, but my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like it because my skin feels clean and not too tight.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these, and if you find that your face is a bit dry right after using them, just follow it up with a moisturizer or olive oil.  </li>
            <li> so they last longer, If its you first time useing AHA products begin with 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell if they&#x27;re reducing fine lines, but I like the way they lather up and cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> but this was true only for my facial area skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived from vendor quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> There are far cheaper ways to clean skin than using these disks (Cetaphyl, other inexpensive cleansers, alcohol based toners, etc).</li>
            <li> one half was enough for face, neck, top of hands and arms.</li>
            <li> The disks are supposed to clean, and diminish wrinkles and dark spots, as well as to exfoliate a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One review indicated it was an old product and that concerned me.  </li>
            <li> (Early 30&#x27;s here).</li>
            <li> I even rub it under my arms to get rid of the old deodorant build up that happens.</li>
            <li> My face does feel extremely soft immediately.  </li>
            <li> I use these morning and night because i like to have NO dead skin on my face that the makeup can cling to.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how foamy these were and not sandpapery at all.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The disks have no effect on the size of pores, as stated in the description, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I follow up with a moisturizer and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li> I recommended the to my 30 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20s, you HAVE to start young.</li>
            <li> face is sensitive but, this product did not give me no problem.</li>
            <li> Too early to see the impact on the face from using it...</li>
            <li> If you have anything close to sensitive skin......</li>
            <li> if you are very sensitive use smooth side or only slight pressure  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not able to find Organic or even natural alternative to this, but still it&#x27;s the best for what it does.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll tell you that there is no scientific reason to prove that ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks actually work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side really earns its name, and the soothing moisturizing side really calms it down</li>
            <li> If your make up is heavy, you may need a whole one or use at least an eye make up remover product on a cotton pad or wash cloth first then a 1/2 pad will be fine.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I feel that one pad cut in half more than suffices, so these should last me twice as long.  </li>
            <li> These disks are more than ample for the average face, so I cut them in half</li>
            <li> and they were a little too powerful in combination.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last a long time, esp since I cut the large disks in half.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> They have just the right amount of texture to feel like you are actually exfoliating your skin on one side and a softer feel to the other side.  </li>
            <li> They are large and very wet and sudsy and require rinsing with water or in my case, I use the shea baby wipes to rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li> i usually see results in as quick as a week, but ive had this for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The other side gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li> and they deep clean without making my skin tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> I just received my product a few days ago, two days ago to be exact.  </li>
            <li> First couple of times used I broke out, but I think it was the trapped oils moving to the surface.</li>
            <li> The disks are large, so I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> With little effort, you can find this item at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I would try some other new products on the market.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job cleansing but is harsh</li>
            <li> I usually mix products because I like certain things about each one.</li>
            <li> usually use it in the shower, and once I pat my face dry, the skin feels exposed and pretty, well, exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this cleanser has improved my skin or not because I am currently going through a phase of a little adult acne.  </li>
            <li> It still works just as well and the container last twice as long!</li>
            <li> Since these disks can irritate the sensitive eye area, just using half the size will do the job.</li>
            <li> A few months before buying this product, I had a professional facial and a Glycolic Peel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a facial in a single pad at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but always go back to the Roc Daily resurfacing pads.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve posted on other RoC products, I can&#x27;t tell you enough how the entire line has changed my life!</li>
            <li> so I have little to work with, such as fine lines, poor elasticity and enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> The disks really allow my dry skin to abosrb the oil, so I have no more itchy, dry areas and my face never feels tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually rub a little olive oil on my freshly exfoliated face as soon as it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Also, I boiled water,  placed my face down over the water; allowing the vapors to open my pores and then used the ROC DAILY RESURFACING DISK.</li>
            <li> The pads are big enough to cut in half.</li>
            <li> I have used these now for the last four months and my skin is definitely smoother and clearer with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> They are big enough to cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and found if I cut the disks in half they are still big enough to use-great savings!</li>
            <li> Skin tone improved a little bit, only if it was recently applied.</li>
            <li> but I do notice the dry areas get buffed away.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin that doesn&#x27;t always agree with exfoliation, but I&#x27;ve been using these for almost three years now</li>
            <li> If you do get them, cut them in half to make them last twice as long.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I did a little research and bought two ROC products-Daily Resurfacing Disks and Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughters use these daily in the shower as do I (late 50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> I use the rough side of the pad on my cheeks, chin and forehead and use the softer side to remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them daily, but a few times a week</li>
            <li> and  It actually takes less time for me!</li>
            <li> This product might be great for some, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, other than make me break out terribly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any other differences though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to give a long-term results of using the disks, but I will definitely re-order the ROC disks again.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of other products i have tried.. and for the price</li>
            <li> I like this because I need resurfacing due to oily skin, blackheads and brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I do cut these in half to make them last longer, but half is plenty!</li>
            <li> Age 40&#x27;s a few years off, but I already have \\&quot;expression lines\\&quot; beneath my eyes, not to mention minor sun spots and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out like I tend to with other products.</li>
            <li> I have used this previously and got away from it, trying other things.  </li>
            <li> take the other reviewers advice and cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several ROC products lately and this one I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I notice no diminishment of wrinkles or dark spots from using these disks.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> would not recommend these disks for the exfoliating or diminishing wrinkles or dark spots, or even for cleaning skin.</li>
            <li> Just the other day, my granddaughter said, grandma!</li>
            <li> One side is a little rougher than the other, but just a tad.</li>
            <li> and I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I do cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I even put some behind a pillow on the sofa, so that if I&#x27;m watching television and it gets late, I&#x27;m never tempted to go straight to bed without washing off makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like to cut them in half</li>
            <li> Half is plenty to wash the face.</li>
            <li> A little helpful hint:  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use these little fellas.</li>
            <li> Just a little tip.</li>
            <li> These disks do little to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> One tip though since they are very sudsy, I&#x27;ve been cutting them in half.</li>
            <li> from la mer down to clinique!</li>
            <li> maybe my skin is too sensitive for this product, but, unfortunately i wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I also leave the disk on the side of the bathroom sink, and just add a few drops of water and use it on your hands.</li>
            <li> Been testing out products, after trying a few</li>
            <li> I cut them in half, and that&#x27;s plenty!  </li>
            <li> After I rinse, my skin feels really really tight!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see if there is a difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (yes, I am lazy) but they are not.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what they did.</li>
            <li> Others suggested cutting these in half, which I tried, but that makes it pretty difficult to use (small), in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between the two sides, though.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> you can reuse the pad at least once</li>
            <li> i mean im not looking for a miracle</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s seriously</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer who suggested cutting them in half.</li>
            <li> Sorry ROC.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to irritate my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t even tingle when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest, for those who want to try it; cutting the pads in 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE BAD</li>
            <li> When you have bad skin, it&#x27;s easier to see improvements.</li>
            <li> It was that bad!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but this stuff is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are heaven sent for a Mom of many. I don&#x27;t have time to do a lot of skin care things. These are really soapy and I cut them in half. It is the perfect size for my face and neck, I feel like I am getting my moneys worth that way. They make my skin look brighter and I have had zero breakouts since trying it. Definitely will repurchase again. Quick, and easy!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any other differences though. Maybe I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> i clean my face with this every night...kind of exfoliates while cleaning....my face feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a high rating even though I&#x27;m just finishing the first container of disks. I like that one side is smoother &amp; I like that they do not burn when washing around my eyes. I like the smoothness of my skin after cleaning with the disks. And, I like that the disks contain plenty of moisture for cleaning. I&#x27;m not able to give a long-term results of using the disks, but I will definitely re-order the ROC disks again.</li>
            <li> These do a good job of exfoliating your skin. However, I was trying to use them at the same time as I was using some of the very excellent ROC products with Retinol and they were a little too powerful in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they do a very effective job of \\&quot;resurfacing\\&quot; your skin, if that&#x27;s your goal.  :)</li>
            <li> Others suggested cutting these in half, which I tried, but that makes it pretty difficult to use (small), in my opinion.  I really like them, though.  They&#x27;re not too drying.</li>
            <li> I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator. It is very sudsy so I was able to use it on my face, shoulders and neck. Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face but this was true only for my facial area skin. Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended. The exfoliating side is not so gentle so DO NOT USE AROUND EYE AREA. I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away and it was just one swipe, I did irritate the eye lid severely. I mostly only wear eyeliner and makeup removers irritate my acne prone skin. I used the smooth side to clean my eyes and it didn&#x27;t make me tear up like soap does. Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE and can definitely see a difference in the depth and size of my pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years so I have little to work with, such as fine lines, poor elasticity and enlarged pores. I have been using the serum for 1 week and I can already see the results of improved elasticity, lines and enlarged pores will probably take longer. I believe in the product because it contains both AHA and retinol, which is actually the only thing that works against signs of aging. The Resurfacing disks proper you skin for the creme and you can cut it in halv so they last longer, If its you first time useing AHA products begin with 2-3 times a week so your skin get use to it</li>
            <li> These are great to remove make up</li>
            <li> Love!! I&#x27;m very fair, in my 40s, combo skin type, DRAMATIC improvement in my skin, pores smaller, skin about 300% smoother, lines diminished and I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week. HOLY GRAIL.  I follow up with avalon organics vitality serum and it&#x27;s seriously like I&#x27;m 25.  TRY THESE!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll tell you that there is no scientific reason to prove that ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;ll tell you that despite the lack of \\&quot;scientific\\&quot; reason, they do most certainly seem to work, and I have been well-pleased with the results. Of course, any good cleansing routine will improve the appearance of your skin. However, this one gives me the look of smaller pores and a smoother complexion. Therefore, as far as I can see, I&#x27;ve purchased a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; in a jar, and I will most definitely purchase it again and recommend it to friends. I&#x27;ll also recommend that you hit the discount and drug stores. With little effort, you can find this item at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, and you will most definitely see the results -- and pretty darned quickly at that.</li>
            <li> I bought these and within 2 Days I had breakout on both sides of my face.  I never have breakouts or pimples- but this stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for daily exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I love these!  They have just the right amount of texture to feel like you are actually exfoliating your skin on one side and a softer feel to the other side.  The lather is just right, it has a pleasant scent, and the size is perfect.  It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much!  My face feels super soft after using these and I notice that blemishes seem to disappear faster.  Luv it!</li>
            <li> Love all Roc products.</li>
            <li> A few months before buying this product, I had a professional facial and a Glycolic Peel.  I loved how my skin felt and looked afterward and wanted to try to achieve those results with an OTC product that was reasonably priced.  I did a little research and bought two ROC products-Daily Resurfacing Disks and Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Like with most OTC skin care products, I took their claims with a grain of salt and hoped for the best, but was pleasantly surprised. I am especially impressed with the Daily Resurfacing Disks I use them as least once a day (mostly for my evening regime in conjunction with the night cream) and within a couple of weeks, my face was smooth, free from pimples and my dreaded deep wrinkle, at the corner of my mouth, was diminishing. I am 40+ years old, spent my share of time in tanning salons (in the 80&#x27;s) and have fair skin.  I really recommend incorporating this product into your skin care regime.     A little helpful hint:  These disks are more than ample for the average face, so I cut them in half and it&#x27;s more than adequate. Since these disks can irritate the sensitive eye area, just using half the size will do the job.</li>
            <li> I just received my product a few days ago, two days ago to be exact.  I am so impress with it already.  I can noticably tell how it changes the appearance of my skin.  It hasn&#x27;t even been a week as of yet so it&#x27;s nice to see the change forming.  Not bad for the price;  I&#x27;ll know more as I continue to use it longer.  But for now, I will have no problem reordering this product again.[[ASIN:B002BWPXH0 ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks, 3-inches (7.62 cm),  (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing... I reviewed some of the comments made about the products prior to purchase.  One review indicated it was an old product and that concerned me.  However, the products I received did not have a date on them so I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is old or new only that it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Love all the ROC products, the resurfacing disks make your face feel like a new born baby&#x27;s.  Love Subscribe and save too!!!</li>
            <li> Roc excellent for the skin good exfoliate.</li>
            <li> works very well...pleased with the resuults</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It is a very effective washing pad that also helps to exfoliate the skin. The pads are big enough to cut in half. My skin looks clearer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> i love ROC products but this one didnt work as great as i expected. i usually see results in as quick as a week, but ive had this for about 3 weeks and it seems my skin has not improved. i mean im not looking for a miracle but i was just hoping for a difference. maybe my skin is too sensitive for this product, but, unfortunately i wont buy again. it does smell great though :)</li>
            <li> I love ROC products and this one is no exception. The soft side is gentle and creamy making your face feel silky. The other side gently exfoliates. Your skin will fell so clean after using one. Make sure you follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this and fell in love during the 1st use!!!  i immediately felt a difference.. and  will now sign up for suscribe &amp; save for this item...   i have a lot of other products i have tried.. and for the price it it perfect. yet functional.. I wash my face while showering.. so I leave this in the shower.. and  It actually takes less time for me! Im so glad I found this product here.. I saw it in the drugstore for almost $30 bucks.. and refused to pay the price for it.. so this makes me happy to have it with free shipping 2 @ a time when i need it!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have tried other products but always go back to the Roc Daily resurfacing pads.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Originally, my husband purchased them for himself, but ended up not liking them. This happens a lot, so I just tend to use his castoffs, as it just saves money and I wasn&#x27;t too worried about a skin regimen. Once I started using these regularly, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my fine &amp;#34;expression&amp;#34; lines around my eyes and forehead! (Early 30&#x27;s here). I&#x27;ve had people comment on how great my skin has been looking. It is the best it&#x27;s ever been. I use this in the shower, then Witchhazel toner and coconut oil to moisturize, every night. In the morning, I use a Eucerine face lotion with SPF. I hope ROC continues to make this forever, because I am now a lifetime user. ROC is now my go to regimen that I share with everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 4 days and I love it. I usually mix products because I like certain things about each one. I have used nothing else. I love the way my face feels after using this. I do cut them in half.</li>
            <li> seems to be safe, and I have had alergetic reactions to a lot of products. Not so with RoC. This is my second order and I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Works great, bought in stores prior, getting it online just makes it easier!</li>
            <li> Love these and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I thought a lot of reviews on here were exaggerated, but I can honestly say that I loved the way my skin looked after the very first use. I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days (and like others have said, use just 1/2 pad each day which is plenty), and I am really seeing a difference already in skin tone. I&#x27;m hoping based on other reviews that with continued use, I will see fine lines diminish. I love that they foam up so well and are easy to rinse off. Based off another review, I&#x27;m going to use the pad on the back of my hands after I use on my face/neck just to maximize it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Just got these and I like them. My skin is very dry so I will use them in between with a gental cleanser on alternate days. After using them my skin felt so clean and soft. If you are someone with normal to oily skin I think you will really like them!. I&#x27;m a female in my fifties.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and I use them as well.  Great product as we both work to undo not taking care of our skin for many years.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  I like the cleansing power, the two-sided discs seem to do the trick.  Like another reviewer, I feel that one pad cut in half more than suffices, so these should last me twice as long.  They have a somewhat chemical scent (even after rinsing) that I don&#x27;t care too much for but it&#x27;s not overpowering and seems to fade after awhile.  I&#x27;m not sold on whether or not my skin actually looks that different but I do notice the dry areas get buffed away.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this cleanser has improved my skin or not because I am currently going through a phase of a little adult acne.  I have a feeling it is caused by hormonal changes, though.  In the meantime, these &amp;#34;resurfacing disks&amp;#34; are easy to use and cover a large area.  They&#x27;re big enough for face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  My wrinkles appear to be lessening also, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the change is huge.  Of course, someone I had not seen in a few months just saw me today and said I looked really good, so perhaps this item has helped me.  I was afraid it was going to irritate my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t even tingle when I use it.  I am pretty happy with it and will continue to use it for a few months to see if there are more changes.</li>
            <li> Left my skin super soft and good for eliminating break outs!</li>
            <li> this was a gift so I don&#x27;t know if is good . But my girl friend love it she recommend it</li>
            <li> This product might be great for some, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, other than make me break out terribly. I&#x27;m 38 and my skin is very oily.  I thought this would gradually soften my skin and help with the blemishes, but instead my cheeks and chin became covered in acne.  I continued to use for a couple more weeks, hoping this was due to the change in skincare routine, but it never got any better.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> Great price - pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I love these  your skin feel and looks great</li>
            <li> This product is superior as far as cleansing,I don&#x27;t like to use cleansers,they are usually greasy but this product is not at all.The smooth side is a good cleanser,the rough side is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Love these....enough said!</li>
            <li> I love these resurfacing disks. I take one into the shower with me every morning. They remove all makeup, along with mascara. Your face feels stimulated when you use the textured side of the disk. I even rub it under my arms to get rid of the old deodorant build up that happens. I do highly recommend you try these disks.</li>
            <li> these are a nice, thick cleansing pad; they are not abrasive (for me) at all.  Lather nicely and are plenty big.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how many times I repurchased this product. It&#x27;s awesome. I use it in combination with my Organic cleanser. Unfortunately I was not able to find Organic or even natural alternative to this, but still it&#x27;s the best for what it does.</li>
            <li> I am an older guy and wanted something to help with maintaining wrinkles and over all skin care. I have used these now for the last four months and my skin is definitely smoother and clearer with less wrinkles. I do use these in conjunction with the ROC evening retinol cream but right out of the shower my face feels super clean with just the pads alone. I will continue to use these little fellas.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I thought they were the no rinse (yes, I am lazy) but they are not.  They are large and very wet and sudsy and require rinsing with water or in my case, I use the shea baby wipes to rinse it all off.  My face does feel extremely soft immediately.  I will give you  updates as to if it holds up to its claims over time. Price seems right for this many.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin that doesn&#x27;t always agree with exfoliation, but I&#x27;ve been using these for almost three years now and it&#x27;s made a world of difference.  The only problem is that since I use it every day, I no longer see a difference...until I run out and go three or four days without it.  Then I&#x27;m right back where I began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell a noticeable difference after the first time I used it.  The exfoliating side really earns its name, and the soothing moisturizing side really calms it down after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it in the shower, and once I pat my face dry, the skin feels exposed and pretty, well, exfoliated.  I usually rub a little olive oil on my freshly exfoliated face as soon as it&#x27;s dry and I never have any problems.  The disks really allow my dry skin to abosrb the oil, so I have no more itchy, dry areas and my face never feels tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these, and if you find that your face is a bit dry right after using them, just follow it up with a moisturizer or olive oil.  It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing after using these. so shiny,clean, dewy, tighter pores...I just bought 3 jars of these pads.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many skin care products &amp; roc is the best. from la mer down to clinique!</li>
            <li> I have written on this item before, but I just wanted to add something.  I have always taken great care of my skin, and tried so many expensive different cleansers, but they just did not fill the bill.  If you are a first time user, use the soft smooth side, and remember to use it gently. If you get too much irritation, then only use it every other day as your skin is not used to this kind of cleanser. I really like it because my skin feels clean and not too tight. I also leave the disk on the side of the bathroom sink, and just add a few drops of water and use it on your hands. You&#x27;d be surprised on how much cleanser remains in that disc. The company sure didn&#x27;t scrimp on the quality of the discs. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S Always have some kind of eye wash near when using any of the RocC  products, as you&#x27;ll never know when you many get some in your eyes. Just a little tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several ROC products lately and this one I will be buying again.One tip though since they are very sudsy, I&#x27;ve been cutting them in half. It still works just as well and the container last twice as long!</li>
            <li> I like this because I need resurfacing due to oily skin, blackheads and brown spots.  I have used this previously and got away from it, trying other things.  I came back and am glad.  When you find something that works, stick with it.</li>
            <li> These clean the skin well without feeling stripped.  It&#x27;s like a facial in a single pad at a fraction of the price.  I use a pad about once a week.  I could use it more often, but it isn&#x27;t part of my daily habit.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife during the Christmas Holiday. She absolutely loves it, looks like I will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Holy grail!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy!!! You will never need to exfoliate with anything else ever again. I use these morning and night because i like to have NO dead skin on my face that the makeup can cling to. This so helped the texture of my skin appear smoother. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> Sam&#x27;s Club had it as a package deal with the night cream too.  I have my own creams that I like but&lt;br /&gt;this product  I use to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face at night and remove all the make up.  Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts&lt;br /&gt;since using this product.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve posted on other RoC products, I can&#x27;t tell you enough how the entire line has changed my life! I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 weeks now, and my wrinkles are gone, some were so deep that I didn&#x27;t even think a facelift would help. I didn&#x27;t look in a mirror and never took pictures. It was that bad! When I started using this line, my skin was different in 2 days. After staying on track with all the products, you wouldn&#x27;t know that I had wrinkles. My granddaughters used to tell me, &amp;#34;grandma, how come you have so many wrinkles?&amp;#34; Talk about hurt. I&#x27;m 58. That&#x27;s when I started with this product. Then the deep wrinkle cream. Just the other day, my granddaughter said, grandma! Where are all your wrinkles? I cried. Happy tears. Try it for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! I&#x27;m not!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using these disks daily, you should start.  My face has never felt cleaner, and my pores seem to have reduced in size.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Roc Disks and the first order arrived after most of the fluid had leaked in the shipping box. I contacted Amazon and had a replacement jar the very next day. Not even sure how they got it here that fast. Beyond my experience with Amazon, I also like this product. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and think these are too strong/drying to use every day but they do provide a mini-facial experience by exfoliating and deep cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product been using the whole line for 5 years now..love it .....love the disks....</li>
            <li> Great product for your face.</li>
            <li> really a great product, use it always, better than soap any day of the week.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The pads foam up nicely and definitely get all the makeup off my face  - I use them in the shower every night.  I use the rough side of the pad on my cheeks, chin and forehead and use the softer side to remove eye makeup.  After only a week or so of using them, I haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference in how my skin looks, but it definitely feels scrubbed clean without any irritation - which is exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m glad I tried these and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li> i have never found this in a store so when i saw it on amazon i picked it up right away. take the other reviewers advice and cut them in half. one half was enough for face, neck, top of hands and arms. i notice a difference the first week. didnt take off 20 years but face feels smoother for lotion</li>
            <li> I was surprised how foamy these were and not sandpapery at all. First couple of times used I broke out, but I think it was the trapped oils moving to the surface. These keep your face fresh but not don&#x27;t expect dermabrasion sloughing, but they really clean your skin deeply.</li>
            <li> great product, my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> So handy to use when you don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole washcloth, cleansing cream thing, and I feel as if it really deep cleans.  I cut them in half, and that&#x27;s plenty!  I still rinse afterwards and use toner before moisturizer.  It just seems more convenient.  I even put some behind a pillow on the sofa, so that if I&#x27;m watching television and it gets late, I&#x27;m never tempted to go straight to bed without washing off makeup.  It&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;resurfacing,&amp;#34; etc., so even better.  I was pleased enough that I reordered before I ran out.</li>
            <li> She says that it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for every woman.  Roc Daily Resurfacing disks leave the skin soft and smooth like no other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these resurfacing disks for a couple of years because they were coming free in the package when I bought another Roc product. So I accumulated a lot of these disk jars. The disks are large, so I cut them in half. The disks are supposed to clean, and diminish wrinkles and dark spots, as well as to exfoliate a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;1. They last a long time, esp since I cut the large disks in half.&lt;br /&gt;2. One side is a little rougher than the other, but just a tad. The smoother side is for around the eyes. It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between the two sides, though.&lt;br /&gt;3. These are good to clean skin. Seem to remove bacteria, light makeup on skin. Leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have somewhat sensitive skin. These disks do not irritate my skin.  But note that I do not have any skin condition to contend with, like roseacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD&lt;br /&gt;1. These disks do little to exfoliate.  Using sugar grains mixed with a tad of warm water does a better job at exfoliating and is practically free.&lt;br /&gt;2. I notice no diminishment of wrinkles or dark spots from using these disks.&lt;br /&gt;3. The disks have no effect on the size of pores, as stated in the description, as far as I can tell. A clay face mask will do a better job on pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these disks for the exfoliating or diminishing wrinkles or dark spots, or even for cleaning skin. There are far cheaper ways to clean skin than using these disks (Cetaphyl, other inexpensive cleansers, alcohol based toners, etc). I use other Roc products for diminishing wrinkles &amp; dark spots; they are more effective than these disks.  So if you can get these free with another product, like I have, they&#x27;re worth using, since they do cleanse the skin. But I wouldn&#x27;t pay for them. If you do get them, cut them in half to make them last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have had these for about 5 days now and already see a huge difference. I am 42 so am battling fine lines and huge pores along with dry skin that used to be oily in my younger years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night to remove my make-up and have noticed how my lines around my eyes are not as noticeable, my skin is tighter and my pores seem to be shrinking. I follow up with a moisturizer and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Follow up*- I have been using this for about a month now and can no longer use it. It is too drying and makes my face itch. I switched over to Aveeno. Sorry ROC.</li>
            <li> ROC Daily Resurfacing Disks are very effective at removing scaly skin cells from brown age spots. This leaves a fresh surfaace for cream or makeup. To my surprise it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve used these for 2 years.  you get a good facial cleaning.  they are easy to use. I do toner &amp; moisturizer after.  also-  we do microdermabrasions periodically through the year.  these disks are an easy way to keep skin soft &amp; clean.  &amp; exfoliated.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Love the exfoliating side of them especially. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell if they&#x27;re reducing fine lines, but I like the way they lather up and cleanse my face. I do cut these in half to make them last longer, but half is plenty!</li>
            <li> These are awesome! So scrubby! I like to cut them in half so they last longer. Half is plenty to wash the face.</li>
            <li> The disks are a nice size. They are big enough to cut in half.  I have only used them for one week but my face does seem to feel smoother.  I am anxious to see if there is a difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they did. Did lather nicely and stay moist though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all.  My skin looks and feels wondeful.  Great to use at night.</li>
            <li> I like this product and found if I cut the disks in half they are still big enough to use-great savings! If your make up is heavy, you may need a whole one or use at least an eye make up remover product on a cotton pad or wash cloth first then a 1/2 pad will be fine. One side of the pad is smooth and the other is nubby- if you are very sensitive use smooth side or only slight pressure  If you can take a good invigorating scrub, then go for it!  I am pushing 60, but still have an oily T zone &amp; get occasional zits. This works well for me, but I use it maybe 4-5 days a week-every day was too much. I use their scrub 2X a week- Roc products work well for me for mature but still oily fair skin that is not sensitive. I occasionally get a flare of eczema and do not use the Roc when I do until it clears up.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Been testing out products, after trying a few this really is one of the better products. I purchased Roc, from the local stores (Target, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens...) but I decided to just order online this time. With regular use, there is a difference in the pores and look of skin, but it has to be used regularly. For the price, worth every penny. The disks are larger than most. What I do is,  wash my face in morning,  then put used disk aside for an evening wash, before tossing it. I&#x27;m cheap, but my skin looks good when I use this so no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Age 40&#x27;s a few years off, but I already have \\&quot;expression lines\\&quot; beneath my eyes, not to mention minor sun spots and acne scars. I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for years, but I read the reviews for these, saw them at Target, and decided to try them. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My complexion is the best it&#x27;s ever been -- AND dewy like a 20-year-old. Now, I just pray that Roc doesn&#x27;t discontinue them, as happens with every product I like.</li>
            <li> I love these disks. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable decrease in wrinkles or other miraculous changes, but my skin is smooth. I agree with another reviewer who suggested cutting them in half. You can even cut them into quarters.</li>
            <li> Cleaned face well but very soapy you can reuse the pad at least once if you face is fairly clean,a lot of product in pad,but felt my face was nice and soft after using,I recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t break out like I tend to with other products. I agree the pads are large, but I don&#x27;t cut them. I clean my neck as well. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in fine lines, but I do notice a difference in my pores. I thought I would try some other new products on the market. I was not as satisfied with any of them and returned to ROC.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters use these daily in the shower as do I (late 50&#x27;s).  Their skin has cleared up considerably and I feel like my skin is lightly exfoliated daily.  I recommended the to my 30 year old daughter and she loves them too.  Wish they cam in larger containers.</li>
            <li> Price out weighed the results. Skin tone improved a little bit, only if it was recently applied.Wrinkles did not fade.</li>
            <li> Meh.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  It does a decent job cleansing but is harsh and I can&#x27;t use it every day (as would be implied by the word &amp;#34;Daily&amp;#34; in the name!) or it irritates my skin.  It is also pricey, but the disks are so huge that you can easily cut them in half and still have plenty of product to use if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for way cheaper at Wal-mart, I think it was around $8. I really enjoy how it makes my skin feel. I use the soft side to soap up my face and neck, then I use the rougher side to gently scrub and exfoliate. After I rinse, my skin feels really really tight! That is good I am guessing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had GREAT skin, so honestly it&#x27;s not like I see a huge difference in my skin. When you have bad skin, it&#x27;s easier to see improvements. I haven&#x27;t really been able to see anything miraculous happen, BUT it keeps it looking really excellent!! It&#x27;s all about preventative maintenance. I am in my mid-20s, you HAVE to start young. Everyone should be using a Retinoid product in my opinion!!</li>
            <li> Good face cleanser.  I love how my face feels after use and how I look in the mornings.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I don&#x27;t use them daily, but a few times a week and they deep clean without making my skin tight or dry.  Product arrived from vendor quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Product is very good &amp; give your face a fresh clean feel and look. I would suggest, for those who want to try it; cutting the pads in 4&#x27;s. This method worked well for me and the product last for 2 months, daily use; once in the morning OR evening. Also, I boiled water,  placed my face down over the water; allowing the vapors to open my pores and then used the ROC DAILY RESURFACING DISK. I was amazed at the outcome. Try this at your discretion and be safe with doing so.</li>
            <li> Had a good larger, leaves face feeling clean. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and got good results. It really exfoliates old skin making face lighter and feel softer. It work so well I bought one for my BFF. Even she had good results. I recommend this product to anyone who is fighting the age process.</li>
            <li> This pad has no ingredients I can see that put collagen back into the skin. Cleansing and peeling don&#x27;t reduce wrinkles! That&#x27;s why the claim is reduces the &amp;#34;APPEARANCE&amp;#34; of fine lines as opposed to reduces fine lines. Makeup does that! If you want to reduce lines, the most clinically proven ingredient on the planet is retinoids (such as retin-A, tretinoin, etc.). Do your homework. No one product does it all. You need to exfoliate with a good multi-hydroxy acid, build collagen with retinoids, and protect with a good anti-oxidant. That&#x27;s what science tells us what works best!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time....face is sensitive but, this product did not give me no problem. Too early to see the impact on the face from using it...</li>
            <li> If you have anything close to sensitive skin...... Don&#x27;t EVEN think about this! Oh it CLEANS... disinfecting wipes do too,  with a fraction of the irritation. In any case rice  your face with cool water after use..... Better yet... Run like I did back to Elizabeth Arden on Amazon. And don&#x27;t look back</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for 2 years now and loves it. She had me buy extras for my two daughters. Even cheaper if you are an Amazon Prime member and obtain it as an add-on.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these pads I only use them once a week and they make my face glow</li>
            <li> NICE TO CLEAN THE FACE.</li>
            <li> Make my skin softer and soften fine lines and wrinkles immediatly</li>
            <li> my daughter swears by these.  bought them for her</li>
            <li> At age 59+, I&#x27;m always in search of the next best thing in facial treatments. I&#x27;ve used Roc&#x27;s eye treatment with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Daily Resurfacing Disks.  I like the way the pads are contoured for easy use around the eyes.  The disks have two textures...The smooth side is for cleansing and the opposite &amp;#34;nubbier&amp;#34; side is designed for exfoliating.  The disks foam up nicely and my face feels very smooth and clean.  I could definitely see results after just two uses.  My skin seems softer, with a more even skin tone.  My pores even look smaller.  Very happy with this product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price, it makes my skin skin glow. I always return back to this product when my skin start breaking out. I love it.</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller after a week of using this.</li>
