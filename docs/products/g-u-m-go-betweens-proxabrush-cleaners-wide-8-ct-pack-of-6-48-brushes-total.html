            <li> So happy to find these here! I have a lot of dental issues and they are a must for me. I was buying them at the drugstore for $1.50 more per pack, and when I ran out I would inevitably go without for a few days until I remembered to get them. WISH AMAZON WOULD ADD THEM TO SUBSCRIBE &amp; SAVE.</li>
            <li> They do the job well. I am getting good reports from my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with the &amp;#34;old design&amp;#34; that people mention, but these are an absolutely a NECESSITY if you have braces.  You can easily clean under the wires with these handy little brushes.  I always carry a few with me at all times for when I eat out at restaurants and have to quickly clean my teeth and braces after a meal.  It would be nice if they were a bit &amp;#34;sturdier&amp;#34;, but they get the job done!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND IT IS SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Can&#x27;t seem to find the tight space brushes locally any longer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I always take. They hold very well in the hand and do a good job under bridges.</li>
            <li> And the packaging seems designed to make you waste (i.e., bend the tip of) the open unit (the one shown at the right side of the package.  Totally unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all a very good product for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Effective.  Great need for gum care.</li>
            <li> Didnt meet my expections. Its too flimsey the older version was perfect dont know why you changed it. Im sorry I ordered them. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the Non flexible grip and what was received was the flexible one which does not work as well, at least for me personally. Perhaps that is my only choice since the SKU numbers are the same four both old and new. I can only guess that one replaced the other. Shame on me for not doing a better research before buying. Shame on them for selling something other than what was shown.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning caught food while on the go.&lt;br /&gt;After laser gun surgery I have to be especially careful about keeping stuff out of the cracks and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;One of these rides in my change pocket at all times, and serves much better than a simple toothpick.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write they do their job</li>
            <li> I need the larger brush for the wide spaces between teeth and these are hard to find in stores. This is just what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> Read the ad carefully, this is a pack of 2 only. Not a 6 packs of 2.</li>
            <li> They seem flimsy compare to others I have used in the past. The wire bents too easily. Wear out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because it was a good buy and now I will not have to run to Walmart to check and see if some are hanging on the rack. I use all different sizes of this product because of the different spaces between my teeth. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find the right size go-betweens at the local drugstores. Rather than running from one drugstore to another trying to find them, I decided to order them on line. They&#x27;re exactly what I want and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great price as I use these everyday, I am happy</li>
            <li> The first time  that i  had my teeth cleaned after i started to use go between the hygienist was so excited with the improvement from the last cleaning she ran to call the dentist in .I personally would do any thing to be in the dental chair for short periods of time and it worked..every time i go for cleaning now i am told i should do  posters for dental hygiene</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. IT IS E4XACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The local Walmart and other stores did not have the wide cleaner, just the narrow ones. Then my dental hygenist suggested I try the internet and found and bought enough to last a long time. Thank you. Hitoshi Yamada</li>
            <li> fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends the wide go Go Betweens for a crowned area way in the back. They work great, and I am getting GREAT dental checkups. But it is hard to find the Wides locally in stores. So what a relief to find this product on line. Just what I needed according to my dentist!</li>
            <li> These keep teeth clean and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning gums and between teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Bendable for easy reaching and cover allows easy transport in your pocket or purse!</li>
            <li> These are great proxa brushes. Not readily available my local pharmacies. Good price and fast delivery. Second time purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Glad I could find them. Local Walmart never has them!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price and shipped promptly</li>
            <li> My husband loves to use these on his teeth. He swears by them.</li>
            <li> Very good for tight spots that floss doesn&#x27;t always remove!!</li>
            <li> I had gum surgery this last year and these brushes were highly recommended by the surgeon. They are much easier to use than floss and after 3 cleanings the results are confirmed that they are working for me much better than vigorous flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have little or no signs of plaque and my gums have recovered from the surgery exceptionally well. The surgery was expensive and scary for me but with proper care using these brushes, my overall health is much improved. Flossing may still be needed between tooth contact but for me all I need are these brushes once a day from both sides of the tooth. Takes a little patience to learn how to brush from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the brush after each meal to remove food but only brush a count of ten for each tooth side once a day. Too much brushing can cause sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the wide gap for most of my teeth but a few also need the Tight gap size.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor gave me at office. Same handle &amp; flex tip, works Great for those wide spaces in the back. I also have the ultra tight ones for those really tight spaces. Even AFTER rinsing then flossing these get out what the floss doesn&#x27;t. I was shocked!  Keeps your gums clear of tartar and bacteria. A Definite Keeper in my house from now on! I use these twice a day and the disposable Soft-picks from GUM after lunch. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I simply cannot live without these brushes. I am wearing braces and these really help remove the food stuck between my wires. These are small enough to fit in your pocket or your purse. I never leave home without them. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love this products and been using this products for last a few years buying at the store.I am so glad that I found them with reasonable price on amazon since buying this products at the store really adds up. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Why did it take YEARS for me to discover this!  Well, I actually have to credit my periodontist.</li>
            <li> these work very well for my braces-loaded teeth, and indispensable part of my oral hygiene regimen:&lt;br /&gt;- interdental brush (these brushes, each of which lasts about a week)&lt;br /&gt;- Water-Pik (hydroflossing)&lt;br /&gt;- Philips Sonicare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;My orthodontist seems very impressed with my teeth (and gum) condition.</li>
            <li> They changed the design/material about a year or 2 ago... their former unit was slightly stiffer and stronger and I liked it much better.  If you can buy the CVS version, it&#x27;s much better than the GUM version at least in my opinion.  The GUM version is flimsier/lighter and not as easy to get between my teeth.  The CVS version is a little stronger/firmer therefore easier to use.</li>
            <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
            <li> For my purposes, the bristles were too thick to go between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I get these for my mother because she loves them.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning your teeth without using dental floss and recommended by my dentist.  Easy to use and does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li> Husband uses these daily after meals to promote gum health.  Especially likes that they come in different widths as he needs the wide width.</li>
