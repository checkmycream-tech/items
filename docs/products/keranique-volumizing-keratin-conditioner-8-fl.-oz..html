            <li> This conditioner it softens my hair and detangles It. Alone with the shampoo prevent my hair from shedding. I&#x27;ve been using . I very tried Carol&#x27;so daughter, but it made my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Keranique Volumizing Conditioner before along with the Keranique Shampoo.  I recommend it because it helps a person who has thinning hair.  Since I do I can say, it works.  I recommend it because it truly has help stop my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has done wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and the slightly tingly sensation...really works well with the shampoo!! I am impressed with this product line.</li>
            <li> As I stated with the shampoo, it didn&#x27;t meet standards and wish there had been a customer satisfaction return policy.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used and I have bleached hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I can&#x27;t believe it works so good I will recommend it to my friends I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much but it did wonders for my hair and boost my confidence level up</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I brought the product for my mother also, and she also loves the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  The only problem I find is......I color my hair and I noticed that the Keranique seems to strip and change the color of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li> Once again I don&#x27;t like the smell that much, nor has it made my hair thicker. Also for the price you do not get that much only 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and I&#x27;m quite happy with the results. I have no problem recommending this&lt;br /&gt;product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a short time, but my hair already feels so much better. Soft, silky and has more volume.</li>
            <li> This product is no different from the average conditioner</li>
            <li> I have limp, baby fine hair...this conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or fuzzy like some conditioners can.</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Hair is soft, shiny and seems to be filling in thicker in spots...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the shampoo, or the conditioner, or the combination...&lt;br /&gt;But she is very satisfied with the product...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK AND FEEL THICKER, DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH HAIR DOWN LIKE MOST OTHER CONDITIONERS.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be for thinning hair, but when I used it I noticed that a handful of hair came out.  That never happens with my regular Pantene.  It also makes your head tingle, like it has menthol in it.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my hair is thickening fast and has stopped falling out</li>
            <li> Thought it worked the first time I used it but every time after that I thought it made my hair look even thinner. I am considered it is bad for my hair and actually making it thinner. It is way too expensive and a waste of money</li>
            <li> I could not get this conditioner they my hair. I didn&#x27;t find any difference in the fullness of my hair, really not worth this price.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Definitely recommend. This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low.</li>
            <li> One use and I saw a definite difference in volume of my very fine hair - felt thicker and had more volume &amp; body - impressed!  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This item caused my hair to dry out and crack off after only one application.  I returned it for full refund and could kick myself for not reading all the reviews BEFORE I purchased it.  If I had read the reviews, I NEVER would have tried it.  I hope this review keeps at least one person from using this horrible, hair damaging product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Keranique shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 2 months now.  My hair is not any thicker and I don&#x27;t see any new growth.  I&#x27;m beginning to think that the advertising for all of this type of product is nothing but hype.</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; great customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything imaginable on the market and this brand is the only line of products for thinning hair that &amp;#34;actually&amp;#34; do their job. After shampooing and conditioniong with other brands I tried this one and just once after using them I was sold. Less hair loss and way more fullness-Love It</li>
            <li> Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li> i have bought this before  i like it</li>
            <li> After a few years with Nioxin, I tried Keratin thinking the Keratin might improve hair texture as well as growth.  I&#x27;m 1/2 bald now.  Ordered more Nioxin and have to start over with slow hair growth/return of hair.</li>
            <li> It works, at least for me. My hair is very thin and limp and Keranique helps to make it feel like it has more texture so it is not so limp and flat.</li>
            <li> Works well for scalp and keeps me from loosing so much hair as with other products.</li>
            <li> Be Careful...I broke out in a rash!!  I have never been sensitive to anything before, but this product caused a rash with in 24 hours of 1st use.  Would return if I could</li>
            <li> The bottle was not sealed and eveything&lt;br /&gt;Was leaking in the bag.</li>
            <li> i have thinning hair and this has worked miracles !!! not just for my hair but my self-esteem as well</li>
            <li> Keranique saved my hair.  the conditioner doesent have the greates smell but the products are fantastic.  i love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thank you and I love soft hair</li>
            <li> Greta for thinning hair</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and renewed.  My hair stylist suggested I try this product and it has been a god send.  I love it and my new growth is indicative of the quality of the product.  In addition, I received this bottle in a plastic bag with the conditioner all over.  Amazon made it right by refunding the mess and allowed me to keep it for use or whatever I saw fit.</li>
            <li> for some reason this is much thinner than the first container I got from Ulta. Don&#x27;t know it the formula has changed. Seems to be working ok, my hair just isn&#x27;t as shinny and silky feeling. Started using a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time . Less hair loss.</li>
            <li> I believe this product to be quality.  Because I add color to my hair and use a curling iron, it is necessary for me to use products that help to correct some of the damage down via the stressors.  These products are more costly than your average shampoo and conditioners, but you have to consider your objective.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh your hair down and gives it volume!</li>
            <li> MAKES HAIR TOO OILY AFTER USE...THE 1ST DAY HAIR IS O.K.. INTO DAY TWO&lt;br /&gt;THE HAIR IS SO OILY , MAKES YOU NEED TO WASH HAIR AGAIN...AND I ONLY USED&lt;br /&gt;A SMALL AMOUNT,  TRIED TO SKIP USING IT BUT WITH OUT IT THE SHAMPOO&lt;br /&gt;DOES MAKE MY HAIR FILL REALLY DRY AND HARD TO BLOW IT DRY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with my shampoo and follicle boost serum.  hair is growing back thou, slowly.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations!</li>
            <li> great produce, good price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference between this shampoo and my old shampoo.  It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I have extra baby fine hair and it really does Volumize my hair and the Keratin in it is good for your hair.  I will buy again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments on how much fuller my hair looks :)))</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me!!!😒😒</li>
            <li> I have severe breakage from over-processing my hair (I go color crazy... I may have a problem...)  But this conditioner has helped with the breakage and split-ends so far.  I&#x27;m excited to see if I have new growth with the shampoo i&#x27;m using.  All I can say is - if it stops my hair from falling out/breaking off, then I am a happy girl.</li>
            <li> still in checking it out phase.  Need to get the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have tried in a while.</li>
            <li> No difference when using product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner along with the shampoo does strengthen your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really works!</li>
