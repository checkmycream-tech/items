    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And my extensions Perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great color and arrived faster!</li>
            <li>It was beautiful and it just glowed in the sun!</li>
            <li>Best choice ever!</li>
            <li>Used a 20 developer and it came out perfect.</li>
            <li>Used with 40 vol developer this product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Great Product!!!</li>
            <li>but it looks AWESOME.</li>
            <li>it works on virgin hair the best!</li>
            <li>so dying the hair every two months (maximum) is best.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps. :D</li>
            <li>well impressed!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>it works best on hair that&#x27;s not already touched by hair dye.</li>
            <li>My experience with this product has been great!</li>
            <li>and I get excellent color payoff with little-to-no damage.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine how bright it might turn out on virgin hair!</li>
            <li>Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li>I loved this product!</li>
            <li>Still worked great, it was very bright</li>
            <li>Really loved it, color came out perfectly!</li>
            <li>beautiful color</li>
            <li>great color too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>I will upload a pic if I can figure out how lol.</li>
            <li>so this was very effective.</li>
            <li>it was just beautiful and bright.</li>
            <li>results were amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Great, bright color, no need for bleach - just some 30 or 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li>I did NOT want bright, clownish hair</li>
            <li>I freaken loved it</li>
            <li>I have done my fair share of research....</li>
            <li>So I had to endure the smell of hair dye for a good two days after I did the job.</li>
            <li>Every month minimum is good.</li>
            <li>A twenty was good for me.</li>
            <li>And the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>So you can even go in the pool and have your hair so faded and do the re-fresh and your hair will look so amazing, bright and rich!!!</li>
            <li>Nice bright color.</li>
            <li>and I just LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I hope you can get more colors!</li>
            <li>also was an awesome trader to deal with, ordered from america.to nz and arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>Contrarily, you can also use a 20 developer with this hilights Magenta and it would come out very nicely but not as strong as with a 30 developer.</li>
            <li>Hicolor is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>i really liked this color.</li>
            <li>and I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>Brown is nice.</li>
            <li>It comes out spectacular.</li>
            <li>this hair dye arrived on time and perfectly packaged and the results were fantastic also loved that I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair first</li>
            <li>it might not be a very bright color on you without lightening your hair first.</li>
            <li>It is very good wil order again ;)</li>
            <li>I love it and ordered more magenta!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very vibrant and comes out beautifully.</li>
            <li>The magenta color is bold and bright.</li>
            <li>I used another loreal developer ( I was kind of dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t come with one), and at first it looked really bright</li>
            <li>The color went on nicely, and this was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>As the result your hair color will appear more even.</li>
            <li>Best red ever.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I use semipermanent color ( ION, MAnic Panic) which makes it healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is such a great color!</li>
            <li>After I enjoyed my purple ombre</li>
            <li>Make sure you use protein filler to achieve an even color throughout.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to keep using this from now on :D</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gorgeous freshly colored.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as if your hair is damaged after using :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Loreal is my favorite hair color</li>
            <li>and I used 2 boxes and waited a day in between so my hair could rest!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Dyeing! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another color with this brand, Red, worked perfectly with my hair.</li>
            <li>Granted, it is very red and bright and I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this color and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li>The quality of the color is outstanding as well.</li>
            <li>:) Will buy again.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>The color was great, but it was too much of a hassle to retain the color.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I went over it with a drug store mahogany on the top and lovedddd the color it gave me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is the best red hair dye out there!!</li>
            <li>That re-fresh tip is the BEST information i can possibly give to anyone.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>so it takes the color more...</li>
            <li>It took two boxes for my hair and make SURE to buy/use a measurer to get the developer mixture correct.</li>
            <li>Best Red Hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>&amp; it makes it pop out more</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for better .</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to love this color.</li>
            <li>Now, this was mostly my fault</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I just bought two more boxes and am hoping that the color will go even brighter afterwards.</li>
            <li>the first out come may not be as bright as you want</li>
            <li>This dye is awesome, but only if you use it right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a brilliant color and an easy-to-use product.</li>
            <li>I greatly recommend this product  and will be buying more in the future...</li>
            <li>Easy to use as well no need to bleach.</li>
            <li>right away!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This color is extremely bright, but not magenta - more like a candy apple red.  </li>
            <li>make me forget important thing.</li>
            <li>My hair just refused to be light</li>
            <li>I decided to get rid of it for job purposes and dyed my faded purple magenta hair a light brown.</li>
            <li>it has a great pop of color (red).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product once before with great results (Red hair is the fastest to fade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice Ariana Grande red velvet look.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the most important thing I wanna suggest you guy is APPLY PRODUCT FROM END TO NEAR TOP, AFTER FINISH YOUR HEAD LEAVE IT FOR 20 MINUTES, THEN APPLY TO THE ROOT</li>
            <li>I love this product it works just the way it says it does and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am so excited</li>
            <li>Overall love this product :) :)</li>
            <li>now,since the first time i used this iwas in love ‚ù§</li>
            <li>If you do not like the shade after it begins fading, just use a semi permanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic to refresh the color.</li>
            <li>so I have to watch what I do and made the decision on Magenta because It wasn&#x27;t as BRIGHT clown red.</li>
            <li>I bought this not knowing how bright it would actually be.</li>
            <li>The box says to use a 30 or 40 cream developer but with my hair, had I used anything above a 20, I don&#x27;t know how bright it would be.</li>
            <li>Bright red hair.</li>
            <li>I loved her outcome and was looking for something to do this Summer besides blonde</li>
            <li>This is a really birght red, works really great, I have light brown hair and didnt even use bleach and the color stuck on me.</li>
            <li>Good luck on your quest going red!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful dark magenta/red velvet type.</li>
            <li>Also, I dyed my whole hair with it if you intend to do this buy more than one box because i have shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li>I love it so much, it is what I have been looking for, for years.</li>
            <li>Not bad but still wasn&#x27;t expecting it</li>
            <li>so when I dyed my hair, those string appear most vibrant.</li>
            <li>I did read that the color fades rather quickly</li>
            <li>frm fading quickly</li>
            <li>It fades rather quickly</li>
            <li>As for my sisters hair hers turned out to more of a hot pinkish color (clearly because she has blonde hair lol).</li>
            <li>So if you have easy hair like mine you should probably go for 20 vol on the roots and 30 on dyed ends or 20 vol for the whole head if you have virgin hair, unless of course you want magenta/pink hair.</li>
            <li>loved the colour of the product, also it didnt fully work on my black pieces of hair but certainly gave me a great head start for dying my hair fully red.</li>
            <li>The color that did show up was BRIGHT PINK, not magenta.</li>
            <li>I can order it from Amazon with fast, free shipping.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was available in more than just magenta, copper and red!</li>
            <li>so I deicded I wanted to add some fun color like a royal purple on my ends.</li>
            <li>The color fades pretty quickly, it&#x27;s supposed to be a permanent dye but after like 6 washes, the color faded.</li>
            <li>I use special effects dye in blood red, this is a vegetable dye so its much better for your hair.</li>
            <li>and it took me some trial and error with a LOT of products to get it right.</li>
            <li>reading the reviews, I mixed magenta w/ a dark plum color so that I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;bright pink&amp;#34; on the virgin hair that people were decribing and the color came out perfect!</li>
            <li>It does bleed and gets everywhere, so keep napkins and bleach ready to clean up after yourself.</li>
            <li>no other hair color gave me the results I wanted, so I fell in love with this product</li>
            <li>Ive had red hair many times and never got such an amazing color.</li>
            <li>I have also had it for over a month and the it still looks pretty fresh.</li>
            <li>Of course, my hair is the type that normally DOESNT respond to very many reds at all unless I dye it blonde first.</li>
            <li>So when I used this junk the top of my head where my natural color grew out was BRIGHT BRIGHT ridiculous fire engine red/hot pink almost.</li>
            <li>Ship very fast.</li>
            <li>It was more brown with red highlights.</li>
            <li>( so does the semi-permanent color) so make sure you use a red towel for your hair.</li>
            <li>or use ION color protector leave in conditioner, it locks it in pretty well too.</li>
            <li>(: Received the product really fast too!</li>
            <li>I did a youtube video on it also if your interested...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty close to Ariana Grande&#x27;s hair on the Nickelodeon show Victorious.</li>
            <li>As a touch up, using this product on the roots and another red dye probably from manic panic on the already dyed hair will help keep the hair healthy.</li>
            <li>It matched exactly to my redskins Jersey.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to first timers.</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red, I could never find a dye that was as bright and red</li>
            <li>my hair comes out to a deep bright red üî•</li>
            <li>but it fades really fast on me , the color however is the exact color you pay for and that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had a hair dye that does that .</li>
            <li>My originally dark brown hair is now a vibrant and beautiful red that is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want a POWERFUL and STRONG bright magenta and red to be showing, you can use the other L&#x27;oreal Excel Hicolor red or magenta that is NOT hilights.</li>
            <li>But when I rinsed it out, my hair was still a dark black color, but with a purple tint, and my roots (the dark virgin hair) were bright beautiful magenta (the color I wanted all over my head)</li>
            <li>so this product gives a nice color on my dyed dark hair and ends but just fades way too fast.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product on YouTube like many other consumers.</li>
            <li>I originally have light brown hair but have been dying it dark for years..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every type of dye to get a bright yet deep and vivid red, and this is it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much as bleach and the color appear beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think maybe researched too much</li>
            <li>for me, not enough time to actually enjoy the color for the price.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>(My hair is usually very responsive to dye)</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that lifted my hair this much with out excess damage.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t mind it much.</li>
            <li>I had dyed red hair and like 3 cm of regrowth, I have natural medium/dark brown hair, straight and thick, I used the 30 vol Oreor creme developer and my ends where almost perfect</li>
            <li>i just dyed it today, so i can lend much of an opinion on the longetivity.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is keep a lot of towels at hand because it will stain your counter really bright pink, REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>It really does look like a salon-quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about using this color because I never got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite red hilighter.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s all well and good, but the box should definitely read that it ONLY works on natural hair color and not colored hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good I bought 4 because the next day, I used the other two to redye some of the darker spots and make it all even.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that if you have really dark hair and want a very bright red you might have to apply it several time or use 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li>It actually looked pretty nice, but rediculous with cotton candy pink roots :</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many box hair dyes trying to get a bright red and this does it for my dark brown (almost black) hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with dark hair that want a bright vibrant red.</li>
            <li>I kept it in for the full 30 min and mixed it with 40 developer.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a medium brown, that has been colored regularly for the past 10 years, I used a 30 volume developer and it lifted and gave it beautiful even color.</li>
            <li>The black was mostly grown out, so I thought this would cover it all.</li>
            <li>Even after redyeing my hair with the same dye 2 more times, it still continuously bled red.</li>
            <li>, yes you will need to maintain red hair more than bleached blonde or brown hair).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month, and it has faded a bit now (and oddly enough it looks darker than before it started to fade) and it has a nice pink undertone rather than an orange one, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It turned out only tinting my hair which actually looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It works so good, but only after you have used the Hicolor dye a few times because the dye lightens your hair!</li>
            <li>Note -- the tube of color is about 1/2 of a normal one -- so that is why people say to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>but mainly I like the product because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require bleaching your dark hair before applying it</li>
            <li>I also leave it in for an hour instead of the suggested 30 minutes, and go a few days without washing so the color absorbs better and stays longer.  </li>
            <li>so the colour took extremely well and is so extremely rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>So if you have naturally dark hair, then this product will work fine.</li>
            <li>Only applied it in all of my hair the first time, then I just use it for my roots.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was amazed and thought hey if this worked for her pinky magenta hair it could work for my purple hair!</li>
            <li>First time experimenting with a red bleach for my hair</li>
            <li>Lifted my dyed faded brown hair and virgin roots so well into a deep but bold red.</li>
            <li>i purchased this, along with Clairol Pure White 40 volume developer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>combined the Magenta with Red like a lot of people recommend and the result have more pink undertone than red.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I really like about using this product is that the color is very similar to the hair sample/display hair.</li>
            <li>rinse it with apple cider vinegar after dying, that&#x27;s a natural way to lock in color.</li>
            <li>and I hope this review helped someone who wants to have blue, purple,pink etc hair without the damage!</li>
            <li>Then I kept hearing so much about L&#x27;oreal magenta, that I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I washed it and when it dried the color looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>, however you will need to reapply it another time to your dark hair before getting the true colour.</li>
            <li>On the parts of my hair where I experimented, they didn&#x27;t dye as easily, but the virgin came out blood red, especially when mixed with a bit of red!</li>
            <li>Even after 6 weeks of 2-3 wash a week, the red is still vibrant.</li>
            <li>i love having obnoxious red hair, but it is a disaster to keep up usually.</li>
            <li>I went from a medium brunette w/ blonde highlights to a vibrant magenta (pink/purple).</li>
            <li>I ordered this with the hopes that it would turn out a dark &amp;#34;red velvet cupcakes&amp;#34; color, like Ariana Grande&#x27;s color hair, and got exactly what i was hoping for!</li>
            <li>But if you have dyed black hair, I would highly recommend pre-bleaching it first (my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel damaged from the bleach, so don&#x27;t worry about that).</li>
            <li>I dyed my whole head, but i had really long hair and needed four packs</li>
            <li>I originally had ombre hair dark on top and gradually fading to a brown then dark dark blonde.</li>
            <li>very, very pure red with deep red areas.</li>
            <li>I used a low developer (20) because I didn&#x27;t want my hair to be PINK, and it gave me a deep, rich burgundy color that lasts.</li>
            <li>I first saw this product on youtube in the color RED, the girl who dyed her hair had some virgin roots and the rest long brown dyed hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural, multi-toned look, which I was not expecting from such an unnatural color.</li>
            <li>So I am currently going to dye my hair blue using this exact same method using Pravana and Loreal Hi Color in magenta!</li>
            <li>My hair was dyed a brown black last December, with a light red underneath as an ombr&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>Fyi, I rarely use heat on hair and the color appear not so vivid, so if you are a person usually use heat to style your hair</li>
            <li>use a 30 developer, it wont damage your hair too much but will last much longer than other ways of getting red.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would be extremely bright.</li>
            <li>ONLY problem I had is that the water NEVER ran clear when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>My roots are brighter but not PINK like some others have said.</li>
            <li>Came 3 days early and same day as the developer I bought.</li>
            <li>so when I put the magenta color on my hair my roots turned out hot pink!!</li>
            <li>(it was black, then to a dark red that faded&#x3D; orange-ish color) and wow, my hair is super red and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The black dye lifted, but the red dye stayed ( it was a lovely dark red, with some lighter and darker streaks throughout).</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments from it and the Manic Panic conditioned my hair and made it feel silky smooth because of the veggie base product.</li>
            <li>It fades VERY fast though, but I suppose this is typical of red dyes.</li>
            <li>The water never runs clear though, but that&#x27;s been the case with any hair color I&#x27;ve ever had that is not naturally occurring.</li>
            <li>I bought only one tube of this hi color in magenta (which I will never do again because I ran out of product) and applied it to my weird dark brassy blonde and left it on for 45 min give or take, after washing it out it was bright red</li>
            <li>It will work on bleached hair and virgin dark hair, to give vibrant colour especially with 2 applications.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> And my extensions Perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great color and arrived faster!</li>
            <li> It was beautiful and it just glowed in the sun!</li>
            <li> Best choice ever!</li>
            <li> Used a 20 developer and it came out perfect.</li>
            <li> Used with 40 vol developer this product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> but it looks AWESOME.</li>
            <li> it works on virgin hair the best!</li>
            <li> so dying the hair every two months (maximum) is best.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps. :D</li>
            <li> well impressed!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> it works best on hair that&#x27;s not already touched by hair dye.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product has been great!</li>
            <li> and I get excellent color payoff with little-to-no damage.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine how bright it might turn out on virgin hair!</li>
            <li> Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Still worked great, it was very bright</li>
            <li> Really loved it, color came out perfectly!</li>
            <li> beautiful color</li>
            <li> great color too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I will upload a pic if I can figure out how lol.</li>
            <li> so this was very effective.</li>
            <li> it was just beautiful and bright.</li>
            <li> results were amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great, bright color, no need for bleach - just some 30 or 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li> I did NOT want bright, clownish hair</li>
            <li> I freaken loved it</li>
            <li> I have done my fair share of research....</li>
            <li> So I had to endure the smell of hair dye for a good two days after I did the job.</li>
            <li> Every month minimum is good.</li>
            <li> A twenty was good for me.</li>
            <li> And the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> So you can even go in the pool and have your hair so faded and do the re-fresh and your hair will look so amazing, bright and rich!!!</li>
            <li> Nice bright color.</li>
            <li> and I just LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I hope you can get more colors!</li>
            <li> also was an awesome trader to deal with, ordered from america.to nz and arrived so fast!</li>
            <li> Contrarily, you can also use a 20 developer with this hilights Magenta and it would come out very nicely but not as strong as with a 30 developer.</li>
            <li> Hicolor is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> i really liked this color.</li>
            <li> and I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> Brown is nice.</li>
            <li> It comes out spectacular.</li>
            <li> this hair dye arrived on time and perfectly packaged and the results were fantastic also loved that I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair first</li>
            <li> it might not be a very bright color on you without lightening your hair first.</li>
            <li> It is very good wil order again ;)</li>
            <li> I love it and ordered more magenta!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very vibrant and comes out beautifully.</li>
            <li> The magenta color is bold and bright.</li>
            <li> I used another loreal developer ( I was kind of dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t come with one), and at first it looked really bright</li>
            <li> The color went on nicely, and this was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> As the result your hair color will appear more even.</li>
            <li> Best red ever.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I use semipermanent color ( ION, MAnic Panic) which makes it healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is such a great color!</li>
            <li> After I enjoyed my purple ombre</li>
            <li> Make sure you use protein filler to achieve an even color throughout.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to keep using this from now on :D</li>
            <li> Lovely color.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gorgeous freshly colored.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as if your hair is damaged after using :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Loreal is my favorite hair color</li>
            <li> and I used 2 boxes and waited a day in between so my hair could rest!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Dyeing! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another color with this brand, Red, worked perfectly with my hair.</li>
            <li> Granted, it is very red and bright and I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this color and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> The quality of the color is outstanding as well.</li>
            <li> :) Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> The color was great, but it was too much of a hassle to retain the color.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I went over it with a drug store mahogany on the top and lovedddd the color it gave me.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is the best red hair dye out there!!</li>
            <li> That re-fresh tip is the BEST information i can possibly give to anyone.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> so it takes the color more...</li>
            <li> It took two boxes for my hair and make SURE to buy/use a measurer to get the developer mixture correct.</li>
            <li> Best Red Hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> &amp; it makes it pop out more</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for better .</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to love this color.</li>
            <li> Now, this was mostly my fault</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I just bought two more boxes and am hoping that the color will go even brighter afterwards.</li>
            <li> the first out come may not be as bright as you want</li>
            <li> This dye is awesome, but only if you use it right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a brilliant color and an easy-to-use product.</li>
            <li> I greatly recommend this product  and will be buying more in the future...</li>
            <li> Easy to use as well no need to bleach.</li>
            <li> right away!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This color is extremely bright, but not magenta - more like a candy apple red.  </li>
            <li> make me forget important thing.</li>
            <li> My hair just refused to be light</li>
            <li> I decided to get rid of it for job purposes and dyed my faded purple magenta hair a light brown.</li>
            <li> it has a great pop of color (red).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once before with great results (Red hair is the fastest to fade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice Ariana Grande red velvet look.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the most important thing I wanna suggest you guy is APPLY PRODUCT FROM END TO NEAR TOP, AFTER FINISH YOUR HEAD LEAVE IT FOR 20 MINUTES, THEN APPLY TO THE ROOT</li>
            <li> I love this product it works just the way it says it does and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am so excited</li>
            <li> Overall love this product :) :)</li>
            <li> now,since the first time i used this iwas in love ‚ù§</li>
            <li> If you do not like the shade after it begins fading, just use a semi permanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic to refresh the color.</li>
            <li> so I have to watch what I do and made the decision on Magenta because It wasn&#x27;t as BRIGHT clown red.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how bright it would actually be.</li>
            <li> The box says to use a 30 or 40 cream developer but with my hair, had I used anything above a 20, I don&#x27;t know how bright it would be.</li>
            <li> Bright red hair.</li>
            <li> I loved her outcome and was looking for something to do this Summer besides blonde</li>
            <li> This is a really birght red, works really great, I have light brown hair and didnt even use bleach and the color stuck on me.</li>
            <li> Good luck on your quest going red!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful dark magenta/red velvet type.</li>
            <li> Also, I dyed my whole hair with it if you intend to do this buy more than one box because i have shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it is what I have been looking for, for years.</li>
            <li> Not bad but still wasn&#x27;t expecting it</li>
            <li> so when I dyed my hair, those string appear most vibrant.</li>
            <li> I did read that the color fades rather quickly</li>
            <li> frm fading quickly</li>
            <li> It fades rather quickly</li>
            <li> As for my sisters hair hers turned out to more of a hot pinkish color (clearly because she has blonde hair lol).</li>
            <li> So if you have easy hair like mine you should probably go for 20 vol on the roots and 30 on dyed ends or 20 vol for the whole head if you have virgin hair, unless of course you want magenta/pink hair.</li>
            <li> loved the colour of the product, also it didnt fully work on my black pieces of hair but certainly gave me a great head start for dying my hair fully red.</li>
            <li> The color that did show up was BRIGHT PINK, not magenta.</li>
            <li> I can order it from Amazon with fast, free shipping.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was available in more than just magenta, copper and red!</li>
            <li> so I deicded I wanted to add some fun color like a royal purple on my ends.</li>
            <li> The color fades pretty quickly, it&#x27;s supposed to be a permanent dye but after like 6 washes, the color faded.</li>
            <li> I use special effects dye in blood red, this is a vegetable dye so its much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> and it took me some trial and error with a LOT of products to get it right.</li>
            <li> reading the reviews, I mixed magenta w/ a dark plum color so that I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;bright pink&amp;#34; on the virgin hair that people were decribing and the color came out perfect!</li>
            <li> It does bleed and gets everywhere, so keep napkins and bleach ready to clean up after yourself.</li>
            <li> no other hair color gave me the results I wanted, so I fell in love with this product</li>
            <li> Ive had red hair many times and never got such an amazing color.</li>
            <li> I have also had it for over a month and the it still looks pretty fresh.</li>
            <li> Of course, my hair is the type that normally DOESNT respond to very many reds at all unless I dye it blonde first.</li>
            <li> So when I used this junk the top of my head where my natural color grew out was BRIGHT BRIGHT ridiculous fire engine red/hot pink almost.</li>
            <li> Ship very fast.</li>
            <li> It was more brown with red highlights.</li>
            <li> ( so does the semi-permanent color) so make sure you use a red towel for your hair.</li>
            <li> or use ION color protector leave in conditioner, it locks it in pretty well too.</li>
            <li> (: Received the product really fast too!</li>
            <li> I did a youtube video on it also if your interested...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty close to Ariana Grande&#x27;s hair on the Nickelodeon show Victorious.</li>
            <li> As a touch up, using this product on the roots and another red dye probably from manic panic on the already dyed hair will help keep the hair healthy.</li>
            <li> It matched exactly to my redskins Jersey.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to first timers.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red, I could never find a dye that was as bright and red</li>
            <li> my hair comes out to a deep bright red üî•</li>
            <li> but it fades really fast on me , the color however is the exact color you pay for and that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had a hair dye that does that .</li>
            <li> My originally dark brown hair is now a vibrant and beautiful red that is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want a POWERFUL and STRONG bright magenta and red to be showing, you can use the other L&#x27;oreal Excel Hicolor red or magenta that is NOT hilights.</li>
            <li> But when I rinsed it out, my hair was still a dark black color, but with a purple tint, and my roots (the dark virgin hair) were bright beautiful magenta (the color I wanted all over my head)</li>
            <li> so this product gives a nice color on my dyed dark hair and ends but just fades way too fast.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on YouTube like many other consumers.</li>
            <li> I originally have light brown hair but have been dying it dark for years..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of dye to get a bright yet deep and vivid red, and this is it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much as bleach and the color appear beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think maybe researched too much</li>
            <li> for me, not enough time to actually enjoy the color for the price.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> (My hair is usually very responsive to dye)</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that lifted my hair this much with out excess damage.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mind it much.</li>
            <li> I had dyed red hair and like 3 cm of regrowth, I have natural medium/dark brown hair, straight and thick, I used the 30 vol Oreor creme developer and my ends where almost perfect</li>
            <li> i just dyed it today, so i can lend much of an opinion on the longetivity.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is keep a lot of towels at hand because it will stain your counter really bright pink, REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li> It really does look like a salon-quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about using this color because I never got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite red hilighter.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s all well and good, but the box should definitely read that it ONLY works on natural hair color and not colored hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good I bought 4 because the next day, I used the other two to redye some of the darker spots and make it all even.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that if you have really dark hair and want a very bright red you might have to apply it several time or use 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li> It actually looked pretty nice, but rediculous with cotton candy pink roots :</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many box hair dyes trying to get a bright red and this does it for my dark brown (almost black) hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with dark hair that want a bright vibrant red.</li>
            <li> I kept it in for the full 30 min and mixed it with 40 developer.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium brown, that has been colored regularly for the past 10 years, I used a 30 volume developer and it lifted and gave it beautiful even color.</li>
            <li> The black was mostly grown out, so I thought this would cover it all.</li>
            <li> Even after redyeing my hair with the same dye 2 more times, it still continuously bled red.</li>
            <li> , yes you will need to maintain red hair more than bleached blonde or brown hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month, and it has faded a bit now (and oddly enough it looks darker than before it started to fade) and it has a nice pink undertone rather than an orange one, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It turned out only tinting my hair which actually looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It works so good, but only after you have used the Hicolor dye a few times because the dye lightens your hair!</li>
            <li> Note -- the tube of color is about 1/2 of a normal one -- so that is why people say to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> but mainly I like the product because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require bleaching your dark hair before applying it</li>
            <li> I also leave it in for an hour instead of the suggested 30 minutes, and go a few days without washing so the color absorbs better and stays longer.  </li>
            <li> so the colour took extremely well and is so extremely rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> So if you have naturally dark hair, then this product will work fine.</li>
            <li> Only applied it in all of my hair the first time, then I just use it for my roots.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was amazed and thought hey if this worked for her pinky magenta hair it could work for my purple hair!</li>
            <li> First time experimenting with a red bleach for my hair</li>
            <li> Lifted my dyed faded brown hair and virgin roots so well into a deep but bold red.</li>
            <li> i purchased this, along with Clairol Pure White 40 volume developer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> combined the Magenta with Red like a lot of people recommend and the result have more pink undertone than red.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I really like about using this product is that the color is very similar to the hair sample/display hair.</li>
            <li> rinse it with apple cider vinegar after dying, that&#x27;s a natural way to lock in color.</li>
            <li> and I hope this review helped someone who wants to have blue, purple,pink etc hair without the damage!</li>
            <li> Then I kept hearing so much about L&#x27;oreal magenta, that I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I washed it and when it dried the color looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> , however you will need to reapply it another time to your dark hair before getting the true colour.</li>
            <li> On the parts of my hair where I experimented, they didn&#x27;t dye as easily, but the virgin came out blood red, especially when mixed with a bit of red!</li>
            <li> Even after 6 weeks of 2-3 wash a week, the red is still vibrant.</li>
            <li> i love having obnoxious red hair, but it is a disaster to keep up usually.</li>
            <li> I went from a medium brunette w/ blonde highlights to a vibrant magenta (pink/purple).</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the hopes that it would turn out a dark &amp;#34;red velvet cupcakes&amp;#34; color, like Ariana Grande&#x27;s color hair, and got exactly what i was hoping for!</li>
            <li> But if you have dyed black hair, I would highly recommend pre-bleaching it first (my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel damaged from the bleach, so don&#x27;t worry about that).</li>
            <li> I dyed my whole head, but i had really long hair and needed four packs</li>
            <li> I originally had ombre hair dark on top and gradually fading to a brown then dark dark blonde.</li>
            <li> very, very pure red with deep red areas.</li>
            <li> I used a low developer (20) because I didn&#x27;t want my hair to be PINK, and it gave me a deep, rich burgundy color that lasts.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on youtube in the color RED, the girl who dyed her hair had some virgin roots and the rest long brown dyed hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very natural, multi-toned look, which I was not expecting from such an unnatural color.</li>
            <li> So I am currently going to dye my hair blue using this exact same method using Pravana and Loreal Hi Color in magenta!</li>
            <li> My hair was dyed a brown black last December, with a light red underneath as an ombr&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> Fyi, I rarely use heat on hair and the color appear not so vivid, so if you are a person usually use heat to style your hair</li>
            <li> use a 30 developer, it wont damage your hair too much but will last much longer than other ways of getting red.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be extremely bright.</li>
            <li> ONLY problem I had is that the water NEVER ran clear when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> My roots are brighter but not PINK like some others have said.</li>
            <li> Came 3 days early and same day as the developer I bought.</li>
            <li> so when I put the magenta color on my hair my roots turned out hot pink!!</li>
            <li> (it was black, then to a dark red that faded&#x3D; orange-ish color) and wow, my hair is super red and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The black dye lifted, but the red dye stayed ( it was a lovely dark red, with some lighter and darker streaks throughout).</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments from it and the Manic Panic conditioned my hair and made it feel silky smooth because of the veggie base product.</li>
            <li> It fades VERY fast though, but I suppose this is typical of red dyes.</li>
            <li> The water never runs clear though, but that&#x27;s been the case with any hair color I&#x27;ve ever had that is not naturally occurring.</li>
            <li> I bought only one tube of this hi color in magenta (which I will never do again because I ran out of product) and applied it to my weird dark brassy blonde and left it on for 45 min give or take, after washing it out it was bright red</li>
            <li> It will work on bleached hair and virgin dark hair, to give vibrant colour especially with 2 applications.</li>
            <li> At first I feel a little weird because I&#x27;m Asian and it just too different from my original color.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after visiting a few videos on YouTube where girls with almost black coloured hair tried this dye and had success.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t judge a red hair dye by a long staying power</li>
            <li> i had previously dyed darker natural toned auburn hair.</li>
            <li> After trying several salon products (and spending a bunch of $$) that did not work, this is the only one that could actually dye my dark, color resistant hair.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair many crazy colors over the years.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been red for almost 2 years, I&#x27;ve gone from your average supermarket boxed dyes to salon care, and I think this is the closest I have come to the red shade I wanted...</li>
            <li> I few months ago it worked really well for my virgin dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> it still didnt keep it in long.</li>
            <li> I had to use two for my long hair.</li>
            <li> (My white headphones are now pink.</li>
            <li> Also, one of my white t-shirts has a pink collar.)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this from the beginning and mixed the two products, wondering why my black hair didn&#x27;t turn red!</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m Asian and have used this on black dyed hair and just last night I used it over brown dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly it never stops bleeding even when I shower in cold water (until it&#x27;s to the point where the color is faded the water finally runs clear)</li>
            <li> I had box dyed black hair (which I thought had faded enough for this, apparently not) when I used the Hicolor</li>
            <li> My hair also isn&#x27;t dry or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I suggest washing your hair less often in order to maintain  the color as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I get magenta hair&amp;#34; and this girl used this exact product to lift her dark brown hair to a red pinky base then applied Special Effects hair dye in Atomic Pink over it</li>
            <li> either way, this is the way to go red if you have naturally dark hair.</li>
            <li> ends (hair that had been dyed and had since faded months ago) was a dark pinkish red color.</li>
            <li> It turned my dark brown hair to a red color instead of magenta though.</li>
            <li> so I only used a 20 developer on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten that I&#x27;d dyed my hair black back in December</li>
            <li> It looked absurd and I was super upset.</li>
            <li> I left it in my hair for a little over 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I said a little prayer and applied my third and final box of L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor, which helped things even out and brighten up a little.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it for people having trouble going red because their hair is so dark/</li>
            <li> i even stopped washing my hair every day and went to every other day to reduce the fading.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the due date.</li>
            <li> so it took my hair extremely well.</li>
            <li> And the black due was a horrible black splooge across the whole middle of my hair like a line, then again crazy bright at the ends.</li>
            <li> Red is a hard color to keep up with,</li>
            <li> Well at least Cosmetic Solutions refunded my money back into my account</li>
            <li> And like it says it does (for dark hair)</li>
            <li> So I did the exact same method on my ugly ombre hair.</li>
            <li> could be because my hair was a really dark brown/black</li>
            <li> I applied this to my faded permanently colored medium brown hair (ion brilliance permanent creme) and about two inches of dark brown roots.  </li>
            <li> I was a dark brown color before I used this product</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair dark brown maybe like a year ago</li>
            <li> So if youve dyed your hair really dark</li>
            <li> Oh and as a last advice, to prevent any bleaching damage, organic/virgin cocoanut oil can be applied to the hair graciously as least an hour ahead of dying.</li>
            <li> so I have a love hate with this product.</li>
            <li> Bleaching my ends were such a pain and seriously damaged my naturally dark hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for years now.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my hair dyed black for years</li>
            <li> so my hair is fully jet black.</li>
            <li> Oh and I have almost black hair</li>
            <li> But after dying my hair black brown</li>
            <li> It comes with a slight bleach in it.</li>
            <li> My hair is pitch black</li>
            <li> I forgot I even had black in my hair</li>
            <li> I added diluted black dye to the roots to darken them a bit)</li>
            <li> but my end still appear a little black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a very minimal amount of fading, but I also only wash my hair 2-3 times a week with a color depositing shampoo in cold water only.</li>
            <li> First off for anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t work in dyed hair you are wrong!</li>
            <li> Please note: this dye will not work on hair that has been coloured dark!</li>
            <li> If u have dark hair doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> really suggest people use COLD WATER to rinse.</li>
            <li> Btw, because I had a few highlight string in summer</li>
            <li> Fades within a few weeks</li>
            <li> Wait to wash for a few days too.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Waste of time and $$$</li>
            <li> Eventually, the color washed off after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> i got a neat ombre effect to it since it was just one tube, and one round of dyeing.</li>
            <li> a few weaks ago i wanted to ombre it magenta today, so i bought this.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it will save you a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li> I mean cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li> In the picture is a little dark compare to the real color (forgive me for bad lighting).</li>
            <li> Only bad thing-is I wish the color would last longer but given the price</li>
            <li> the only bad part is that it&#x27;s now a week later and my hair on the bottom is basically orange.</li>
            <li> next round ill wind up brushing it on as apposed to hand application out of bowl.</li>
            <li> (Never use Loreal Excellence btw it dried out my hair yuck!)</li>
            <li> I had a lame box color mahogany red before..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to post a few pictures on here of my hair, I&#x27;m the brown chick in case you see them!</li>
            <li> But a few days after dyeing it (wait at least 2)</li>
            <li> Ive used this stuff for a while and hated how fast it fades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good to continually bleach one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently realized that boring nuterals just did not fit me.</li>
            <li> But with this crap holy ish. 30 mins and my hair was anime red.</li>
            <li> I hate this product don&#x27;t use if u have dark hair</li>
            <li> The red they gave me was really boring.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because  there was no creme developer included  in the kit,  and I am unhappy</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed that it&#x27;s not darker, but I&#x27;m not going to complain since I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair.  </li>
            <li> It fades within a week which is terrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed no one should purchase from this seller! !!!!!</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far my favorite red hilighter. It lasts and is not runny. great color too. I recommend a 40 developer</li>
            <li> It is very good wil order again ;)</li>
            <li> Ship very fast.I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much as bleach and the color appear beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I combined the Magenta with Red like a lot of people recommend and the result have more pink undertone than red. At first I feel a little weird because I&#x27;m Asian and it just too different from my original color. Btw, because I had a few highlight string in summer so when I dyed my hair, those string appear most vibrant. I put on a lot of product on my hair with even amount but my end still appear a little black maybe because my end is damaged since i dyed my hair may times last year. I&#x27;ve been researching this for about 2 weeks before I actually dye my hair. I think maybe researched too much make me forget important thing. Therefore, the most important thing I wanna suggest you guy is APPLY PRODUCT FROM END TO NEAR TOP, AFTER FINISH YOUR HEAD LEAVE IT FOR 20 MINUTES, THEN APPLY TO THE ROOT AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. As the result your hair color will appear more even. In the picture is a little dark compare to the real color (forgive me for bad lighting). Fyi, I rarely use heat on hair and the color appear not so vivid, so if you are a person usually use heat to style your hair I suggest you nourish your hair well before dying. Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> i really liked this color. it was just beautiful and bright. but it only lasted a week. i used color care shampoo and conditioner, color care serum in my hair. i even stopped washing my hair every day and went to every other day to reduce the fading. it still didnt keep it in long. for me, not enough time to actually enjoy the color for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for years now. I wanted to go red so I went to the salon. The red they gave me was really boring. It was more brown with red highlights. They also dyed my remmy extensions the same shade. So I youtubed this product and figured, what the heck. It dyed my hair And my extensions Perfectly. It does bleed a lot in the shower though so I also bought manic panic in Fusha to use mixed with some conditioner. Hicolor is absolutely amazing. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Really loved it, color came out perfectly!</li>
            <li> Ive used this stuff for a while and hated how fast it fades. It fades within a week which is terrible. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Works well after 2 applications</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Best red ever. Ive had red hair many times and never got such an amazing color. Even after 6 weeks of 2-3 wash a week, the red is still vibrant. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It lifted my hair to the color I wanted without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 1 year. After trying several salon products (and spending a bunch of $$) that did not work, this is the only one that could actually dye my dark, color resistant hair. I use it with L&#x27;oreal Oreor creme 30 vol developer. Only applied it in all of my hair the first time, then I just use it for my roots. For the rest of my hair I use semipermanent color ( ION, MAnic Panic) which makes it healthy and shiny ( if you keep applying de hicolor highlights your hair will get progressively lighter). It bleeds every time you wash it ( so does the semi-permanent color) so make sure you use a red towel for your hair. I use Loreal Color Vibrancy shampoo, conditioner and heat protector to keep the color for longer time. I love it and I would recommend it for people having trouble going red because their hair is so dark/ color resistant. Keep in mind that if you have really dark hair and want a very bright red you might have to apply it several time or use 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dye as an all-over color since Mother&#x27;s Day of 2007 and I just LOVE it! It&#x27;s such a brilliant color and an easy-to-use product. I just wish it was available in more than just magenta, copper and red!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these boxes.. My package did not even make it to me and was returned somehow.. I have no clue! Well at least Cosmetic Solutions refunded my money back into my account right away!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great color and arrived faster!</li>
            <li> First off for anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t work in dyed hair you are wrong! I have been getting my hair dyed black for years so my hair is fully jet black. I wanted to try red under neath my hair but I didn&#x27;t want it too red so I chose to go with the magenta color (my sister decided to try it to even tho she has blonde hair). I kept it in for the full 30 min and mixed it with 40 developer. And like it says it does (for dark hair) it came out to a darker red. NO bleach was added. I love this product it works just the way it says it does and was exactly what I wanted. As for my sisters hair hers turned out to more of a hot pinkish color (clearly because she has blonde hair lol). I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is such a great color! The one thing that I really like about using this product is that the color is very similar to the hair sample/display hair. The magenta color is bold and bright. You will get noticed. Only bad thing-is I wish the color would last longer but given the price, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I may only have the fading issue because of me having severely color damaged hair but it fades really fast on me , the color however is the exact color you pay for and that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had a hair dye that does that . If you have the money for upkeep I suggest this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of dye to get a bright yet deep and vivid red, and this is it. use a 30 developer, it wont damage your hair too much but will last much longer than other ways of getting red. rinse it with apple cider vinegar after dying, that&#x27;s a natural way to lock in color. or use ION color protector leave in conditioner, it locks it in pretty well too. Use ION color semi perm dyes to refresh the red once it fades (if you like). either way, this is the way to go red if you have naturally dark hair. i prefer the magenta hue but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on YouTube like many other consumers. I originally had ombre hair dark on top and gradually fading to a brown then dark dark blonde. Bleaching my ends were such a pain and seriously damaged my naturally dark hair and it just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. My hair just refused to be light so I deicded I wanted to add some fun color like a royal purple on my ends. However, I did not want to bleach my hair lighter in order for the color to take I knew it would just continue to break off and I would eventually have to chop off all of my damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead I research different hair dying tutorials on YouTube and I found this one entitled something close to &amp;#34;How I get magenta hair&amp;#34; and this girl used this exact product to lift her dark brown hair to a red pinky base then applied Special Effects hair dye in Atomic Pink over it and she had magenta hair with out prelightening it! Wow, I was amazed and thought hey if this worked for her pinky magenta hair it could work for my purple hair! So I did the exact same method on my ugly ombre hair. I bought only one tube of this hi color in magenta (which I will never do again because I ran out of product) and applied it to my weird dark brassy blonde and left it on for 45 min give or take, after washing it out it was bright red and then I applied my Manic Panic Purple Haze that I had also purchased and applied that all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were amazing! My hair was an eggplant magenta color!!! It was beautiful and it just glowed in the sun! I got so many compliments from it and the Manic Panic conditioned my hair and made it feel silky smooth because of the veggie base product. This is my how to get colored hair with out pre bleaching method! After I enjoyed my purple ombre I decided to get rid of it for job purposes and dyed my faded purple magenta hair a light brown. (Never use Loreal Excellence btw it dried out my hair yuck!) I currently realized that boring nuterals just did not fit me. So I am currently going to dye my hair blue using this exact same method using Pravana and Loreal Hi Color in magenta! I am so excited and I hope this review helped someone who wants to have blue, purple,pink etc hair without the damage!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I had to use two for my long hair. I am used to dying my hair red so this was very effective. I had let the red fade out to a copper color before using this with a 30 developer. Make sure you use protein filler to achieve an even color throughout.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red, I could never find a dye that was as bright and red and I would&#x27;ve liked. Then I kept hearing so much about L&#x27;oreal magenta, that I finally decided to give it a try. Best choice ever! My hair was an orangey color, cause I dyed it before (it was black, then to a dark red that faded&#x3D; orange-ish color) and wow, my hair is super red and vibrant. It&#x27;s the color I&#x27;ve always wanted. I used 2 boxes and 30 vol. developer. Didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all! Definitely going to keep using this from now on :D</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Fades within a few weeks but it&#x27;s gorgeous freshly colored. It does change in different lights. Sadly it never stops bleeding even when I shower in cold water (until it&#x27;s to the point where the color is faded the water finally runs clear)</li>
            <li> The color fades pretty quickly, it&#x27;s supposed to be a permanent dye but after like 6 washes, the color faded.</li>
            <li> Please note: this dye will not work on hair that has been coloured dark! It will work on bleached hair and virgin dark hair, to give vibrant colour especially with 2 applications. It fades VERY fast though, but I suppose this is typical of red dyes. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as if your hair is damaged after using :)</li>
            <li> First time experimenting with a red bleach for my hair and I&#x27;m in love. I had a lame box color mahogany red before.. Used a 20 developer and it came out perfect. Will definitely continue with this product. ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Loreal is my favorite hair color it has a great pop of color (red).  will definately order this product again.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on youtube in the color RED, the girl who dyed her hair had some virgin roots and the rest long brown dyed hair. I loved her outcome and was looking for something to do this Summer besides blonde so I decided red will do. I work for a bank so I have to watch what I do and made the decision on Magenta because It wasn&#x27;t as BRIGHT clown red. Used with 40 vol developer this product is amazing!!! Lifted my dyed faded brown hair and virgin roots so well into a deep but bold red. My roots are brighter but not PINK like some others have said. My hair also isn&#x27;t dry or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I really suggest people use COLD WATER to rinse. Color protectant shampoo + Conditioner and hear protectant when blow drying. Wait to wash for a few days too.&lt;br /&gt;Also My hair is to my shoulders and I used 2 boxes and waited a day in between so my hair could rest!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Dyeing! :)</li>
            <li> I hate this product don&#x27;t use if u have dark hair cuz it doesn&#x27;t work I asked for a refund it&#x27;s been 2 or 3 days and still no refund !! Very disappointed no one should purchase from this seller! !!!!! Buyer beware! If u have dark hair doesn&#x27;t work! Waste of time and $$$</li>
            <li> beautiful color and it really doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product!</li>
            <li> WARNING! This will not work the way it&#x27;s supposed to of you don&#x27;t have virgin hair, meaning hair that hasn&#x27;t been dyed in months/years. I&#x27;d forgotten that I&#x27;d dyed my hair black back in December and this color only took on my roots. (My hair is usually very responsive to dye) The color that did show up was BRIGHT PINK, not magenta. I mean cotton candy pink. I used a 30 Dev with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ends (hair that had been dyed and had since faded months ago) was a dark pinkish red color. It actually looked pretty nice, but rediculous with cotton candy pink roots :-\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another color with this brand, Red, worked perfectly with my hair. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well lessoned learned. Don&#x27;t use unless your hair is virgin or you haven&#x27;t dyed it in over 6 months/a year.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!(: Received the product really fast too! It turned my dark brown hair to a red color instead of magenta though. could be because my hair was a really dark brown/black</li>
            <li> My highschool days when i colored my hair funky colors! This is a really birght red, works really great, I have light brown hair and didnt even use bleach and the color stuck on me.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my faded permanently colored medium brown hair (ion brilliance permanent creme) and about two inches of dark brown roots.  Used 30 volume creme developer (Salon Care brand).  Left on for 45 minutes and then rinsed and conditioned.  The box says to shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t.  This color is extremely bright, but not magenta - more like a candy apple red.  Granted, it is very red and bright and I am extremely happy with it.  I am slightly disappointed that it&#x27;s not darker, but I&#x27;m not going to complain since I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair.  Color is comparable to Jerome Russell Punky colors Pillarbox Red.</li>
            <li> Not bad but still wasn&#x27;t expecting it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color and so does everyone else. All I hear is &amp;#34;your hair color is amazing&amp;#34;. I even had a stranger tell me I looked like a mermaid haha It&#x27;s very vibrant and comes out beautifully. Oh and I have almost black hair and it worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded all my standards! I saw no signs of damages what so ever! I have dyed my hair many crazy colors over the years. I have never used a product that lifted my hair this much with out excess damage. The quality of the color is outstanding as well. It has a very natural, multi-toned look, which I was not expecting from such an unnatural color. I have also had it for over a month and the it still looks pretty fresh. I&#x27;ve seen a very minimal amount of fading, but I also only wash my hair 2-3 times a week with a color depositing shampoo in cold water only. The water never runs clear though, but that&#x27;s been the case with any hair color I&#x27;ve ever had that is not naturally occurring. All in all I would defiantly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a very nice Ariana Grande red velvet look.</li>
            <li> I was a dark brown color before I used this product and now I&#x27;m red velvet red. :) Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I read the review and decided to buy this product at my nearest beauty supply store. I freaken loved it I get so many compliments I wish my camera would do this haircolor justice. I did read that the color fades rather quickly I&#x27;ll just wait and see... I only used 20 developer I was afraid it would be extremely bright. I had dyed my hair dark brown maybe like a year ago and I was trying to go back to red and no other hair color gave me the results I wanted, so I fell in love with this product</li>
            <li> Love love love this hair dye arrived on time and perfectly packaged and the results were fantastic also loved that I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair first I greatly recommend this product  and will be buying more in the future...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been red for almost 2 years, I&#x27;ve gone from your average supermarket boxed dyes to salon care, and I think this is the closest I have come to the red shade I wanted... on my ends that is, because my roots turned out PINK!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m into funky hair so I didn&#x27;t mind it much. I had dyed red hair and like 3 cm of regrowth, I have natural medium/dark brown hair, straight and thick, I used the 30 vol Oreor creme developer and my ends where almost perfect but my roots where well MAGENTA just like the box says. So if you have easy hair like mine you should probably go for 20 vol on the roots and 30 on dyed ends or 20 vol for the whole head if you have virgin hair, unless of course you want magenta/pink hair. I am soon going to try this product in RED hoping to achieve my dream tone.</li>
            <li> The color went on nicely, and this was fairly easy to use. However, my hair continuously bled red each time I washed it. It stained all of my white towels! Eventually, the color washed off after a few weeks. Even after redyeing my hair with the same dye 2 more times, it still continuously bled red. The color was great, but it was too much of a hassle to retain the color.</li>
            <li> i just dyed it today, so i can lend much of an opinion on the longetivity.&lt;br /&gt;however, i can say that this dye is killer. i had previously dyed darker natural toned auburn hair. i love having obnoxious red hair, but it is a disaster to keep up usually. i purchased this, along with Clairol Pure White 40 volume developer.&lt;br /&gt;WOW. i got a neat ombre effect to it since it was just one tube, and one round of dyeing. but it looks AWESOME. very, very pure red with deep red areas. next round ill wind up brushing it on as apposed to hand application out of bowl. i had no issues with skin staining after washing (i use mane and  tail after i color). do shampoo after you color. it gets the gunk that the lifter produced out, leaving you with a brighter color. will definitely buy again, but in the bigger packs.</li>
            <li> okay so I have a love hate with this product. I originally have light brown hair but have been dying it dark for years.. so when I put the magenta color on my hair my roots turned out hot pink!! it was horrible. I went over it with a drug store mahogany on the top and lovedddd the color it gave me. the only bad part is that it&#x27;s now a week later and my hair on the bottom is basically orange. so this product gives a nice color on my dyed dark hair and ends but just fades way too fast.</li>
            <li> I love it. Nice bright color. I hope you can get more colors!</li>
            <li> I few months ago it worked really well for my virgin dark brown hair. I dyed my whole head, but i had really long hair and needed four packs hahaha. But after dying my hair black brown a few weaks ago i wanted to ombre it magenta today, so i bought this. It turned out only tinting my hair which actually looks pretty cool. So if youve dyed your hair really dark it might not be a very bright color on you without lightening your hair first. Overall love this product :) :)</li>
            <li> This product is the best red hair dye out there!! Trust me I have done my fair share of research.... I did a youtube video on it also if your interested... channel name- youngbeautifullol it works on virgin hair the best! I use 30 vol developer, and leave it on for about 45 mins or so.... and the first out come may not be as bright as you want but after a month do it again and it should get brighter. But every time you dye it again it gets brighter and it lasts longer each time. I do a color re-fresh when ever it gets faded. I use special effects dye in blood red, this is a vegetable dye so its much better for your hair. I put this in my hair like a shampoo in the shower and leave it on over night. That re-fresh tip is the BEST information i can possibly give to anyone. It works so good, but only after you have used the Hicolor dye a few times because the dye lightens your hair! So you can even go in the pool and have your hair so faded and do the re-fresh and your hair will look so amazing, bright and rich!!! Hope this helps! Good luck on your quest going red! :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I use deep auburn red hicolor dye on my roots so they don&#x27;t turn out neon, because thats the virgin hair so it takes the color more... bye guys &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after visiting a few videos on YouTube where girls with almost black coloured hair tried this dye and had success. I did NOT want bright, clownish hair so I only used a 20 developer on my dark brown hair. My hair has only been dyed once in my lifetime (I&#x27;m 20) so the colour took extremely well and is so extremely rich and vibrant. It&#x27;s a beautiful dark magenta/red velvet type. It&#x27;s pretty close to Ariana Grande&#x27;s hair on the Nickelodeon show Victorious. It took two boxes for my hair and make SURE to buy/use a measurer to get the developer mixture correct. I left it in my hair for a little over 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY problem I had is that the water NEVER ran clear when I rinsed it out. So I had to endure the smell of hair dye for a good two days after I did the job. I&#x27;m going to post a few pictures on here of my hair, I&#x27;m the brown chick in case you see them! Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the hopes that it would turn out a dark &amp;#34;red velvet cupcakes&amp;#34; color, like Ariana Grande&#x27;s color hair, and got exactly what i was hoping for! I used another loreal developer ( I was kind of dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t come with one), and at first it looked really bright and I freaked out and tried to wash it...obviously since its permanent dye that didnt work. But a few days after dyeing it (wait at least 2) I washed it and when it dried the color looked fantastic. My only suggestion is keep a lot of towels at hand because it will stain your counter really bright pink, REALLY FAST. Also, I dyed my whole hair with it if you intend to do this buy more than one box because i have shoulder-length hair and it didnt cover all of it,</li>
            <li> Best Red Hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes with a slight bleach in it. My hair is pitch black and it took me some trial and error with a LOT of products to get it right. On the parts of my hair where I experimented, they didn&#x27;t dye as easily, but the virgin came out blood red, especially when mixed with a bit of red! It&#x27;s good I bought 4 because the next day, I used the other two to redye some of the darker spots and make it all even. It really does look like a salon-quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dye comes out, my hair looks brown or a bit coppery, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Brown is nice. Red is a hard color to keep up with, so dying the hair every two months (maximum) is best. Every month minimum is good. As a touch up, using this product on the roots and another red dye probably from manic panic on the already dyed hair will help keep the hair healthy. It&#x27;s not good to continually bleach one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want a POWERFUL and STRONG bright magenta and red to be showing, you can use the other L&#x27;oreal Excel Hicolor red or magenta that is NOT hilights. The hilights branch come out brighter and stronger. I didn&#x27;t know this from the beginning and mixed the two products, wondering why my black hair didn&#x27;t turn red! Contrarily, you can also use a 20 developer with this hilights Magenta and it would come out very nicely but not as strong as with a 30 developer. Oh and as a last advice, to prevent any bleaching damage, organic/virgin cocoanut oil can be applied to the hair graciously as least an hour ahead of dying. This helps your hair to dye easier and prevents damage. My hair is actually softer than before I dyed it because I used it! I hope this review helps. :D</li>
            <li> ive been dying my hair w this dye for a while now,since the first time i used this iwas in love ‚ù§ i always buy frm sallys w my sallys card cus its helllla cheaper, &amp; i always add a lil sumn to keep it frm fading quickly &amp; it makes it pop out more , i always use loreal 4O developer also. i rinse w lukewarm water nd condition w pantine color protecting conditioner  &amp; dnt wash it for afew days after dying..  my hair comes out to a deep bright red üî•</li>
            <li> loved the colour of the product, also it didnt fully work on my black pieces of hair but certainly gave me a great head start for dying my hair fully red. also was an awesome trader to deal with, ordered from america.to nz and arrived so fast! well impressed!</li>
            <li> Note -- the tube of color is about 1/2 of a normal one -- so that is why people say to use 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, I mixed magenta w/ a dark plum color so that I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;bright pink&amp;#34; on the virgin hair that people were decribing and the color came out perfect! I went from a medium brunette w/ blonde highlights to a vibrant magenta (pink/purple). I used a 30 vol developer. I love it and ordered more magenta!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims. I just needed two tubes for my shoulder length hair, used a 30 vol developer.</li>
            <li> This product was ex actually  what was stated on the description . It arrived before the due date. Would use this site again</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how bright it would actually be. The box says to use a 30 or 40 cream developer but with my hair, had I used anything above a 20, I don&#x27;t know how bright it would be. A twenty was good for me. And the color is gorgeous. Everyone has complimented it. It matched exactly to my redskins Jersey. So if you need a color idea, look at one. Came 3 days early and same day as the developer I bought.</li>
            <li> I like the colour but mainly I like the product because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require bleaching your dark hair before applying it, however you will need to reapply it another time to your dark hair before getting the true colour.</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for better . Bright red hair. Easy to use as well no need to bleach. Yay</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used this product once before with great results (Red hair is the fastest to fade so I don&#x27;t judge a red hair dye by a long staying power, yes you will need to maintain red hair more than bleached blonde or brown hair). Great, bright color, no need for bleach - just some 30 or 40 volume developer. I like that I can order it from Amazon with fast, free shipping. Will definitely repurchase! For reference, I&#x27;m Asian and have used this on black dyed hair and just last night I used it over brown dyed hair. Still worked great, it was very bright and I can&#x27;t imagine how bright it might turn out on virgin hair!</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to love this color. And that&#x27;s all well and good, but the box should definitely read that it ONLY works on natural hair color and not colored hair. My hair was dyed a brown black last December, with a light red underneath as an ombr&amp;eacute;. I haven&#x27;t touched it with hair dye since. The black was mostly grown out, so I thought this would cover it all. Now, this was mostly my fault cause I forgot I even had black in my hair that&#x27;s how faded it was. So when I used this junk the top of my head where my natural color grew out was BRIGHT BRIGHT ridiculous fire engine red/hot pink almost. And the black due was a horrible black splooge across the whole middle of my hair like a line, then again crazy bright at the ends. It looked absurd and I was super upset. Of course, my hair is the type that normally DOESNT respond to very many reds at all unless I dye it blonde first. But with this crap holy ish. 30 mins and my hair was anime red. Idk. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to first timers. And am only giving it one star bc it works best on hair that&#x27;s not already touched by hair dye.</li>
            <li> LOVE. I&#x27;ve tried many box hair dyes trying to get a bright red and this does it for my dark brown (almost black) hair. I buy from Sally&#x27;s, to avoid shipping and handling fees. I wash every 2-3 days and it lasts around 5 weeks before needingto be refreshed. I also leave it in for an hour instead of the suggested 30 minutes, and go a few days without washing so the color absorbs better and stays longer.  Highly recommend for those with dark hair that want a bright vibrant red. I will upload a pic if I can figure out how lol.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about using this color because I never got the results I wanted. But after reading all the reviews and looking at the pictures I decided to give it a try. I love it so much, it is what I have been looking for, for years. My natural hair color is a medium brown, that has been colored regularly for the past 10 years, I used a 30 volume developer and it lifted and gave it beautiful even color.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product has been great! I use one tube of this and one tube of the same product in red, mixed with a 30 vol. developer. It comes out spectacular. My originally dark brown hair is now a vibrant and beautiful red that is exactly what I was looking for. I suggest washing your hair less often in order to maintain  the color as long as possible. If you do not like the shade after it begins fading, just use a semi permanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic to refresh the color.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This dye is awesome, but only if you use it right! I had box dyed black hair (which I thought had faded enough for this, apparently not) when I used the Hicolor, I used two boxes of the Hicolor magenta dye, and 30 vol developer to cover all of my hair (I have hair that is about 15 inches in length) and followed all the instructions. But when I rinsed it out, my hair was still a dark black color, but with a purple tint, and my roots (the dark virgin hair) were bright beautiful magenta (the color I wanted all over my head) even though I still did them last. So I threw on a hat and made an emergency trip to the drug store and bought a box of bleach. After applying the bleach to my hair (NOT the roots! I added diluted black dye to the roots to darken them a bit) The black dye lifted, but the red dye stayed ( it was a lovely dark red, with some lighter and darker streaks throughout). I said a little prayer and applied my third and final box of L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor, which helped things even out and brighten up a little. It&#x27;s been about a month, and it has faded a bit now (and oddly enough it looks darker than before it started to fade) and it has a nice pink undertone rather than an orange one, which is what I wanted. I just bought two more boxes and am hoping that the color will go even brighter afterwards. So if you have naturally dark hair, then this product will work fine. But if you have dyed black hair, I would highly recommend pre-bleaching it first (my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel damaged from the bleach, so don&#x27;t worry about that). Trust me, it will save you a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because  there was no creme developer included  in the kit,  and I am unhappy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last two months and I get excellent color payoff with little-to-no damage. I had virgin hair before I used this dye so it took my hair extremely well. I used a low developer (20) because I didn&#x27;t want my hair to be PINK, and it gave me a deep, rich burgundy color that lasts. It does bleed and gets everywhere, so keep napkins and bleach ready to clean up after yourself. (My white headphones are now pink. Also, one of my white t-shirts has a pink collar.) It fades rather quickly but I got compliments on my hair all the way up until I dyed it again. (It lasted about 4 weeks and survived 6 washes with color shielding products and red-depositing conditioners. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sticking with this product, definitely! GET IT.</li>
