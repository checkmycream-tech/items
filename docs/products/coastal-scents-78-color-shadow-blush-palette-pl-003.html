            <li>The colours are amazing, and go on nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect it to show amazingly on my skin.</li>

            <li>Glamorous 360 Deluxe Palette ($130 Value)]]    </li>
            <li>Would not recommend based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>Nice size mirror is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sigma Makeup Travel Kit - Nice in Pink]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the colors are really nice</li>
            <li>The blushes are the perfect colors and makes my cheeks really glow.</li>
            <li>so I have to use my own.</li>
            <li>I really liked the slim compact design with the mirror.</li>
            <li>Has so many colors, good coverage when used.</li>
            <li>How nice.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>the variety is nice.  </li>
            <li>Many of my classmates also loved Coastal Scents.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely 100% pleased with the product!!!</li>
            <li>colors stay on nicely, with no irritation, but even better if you apply a primer.</li>
            <li>There are more colors then I will ever use but it is nice to have the choice.</li>
            <li>, i have even ordered for two more of these to gift to my niece&#x27;s , the colors are really good blends easily</li>
            <li>I love love love this palette!</li>
            <li>able to to many, many color combos!</li>
            <li>The blushes are awesome though, they show and highlight my face without me looking like a clown (which is easy to do with high cheek bones).</li>
            <li>Great way to find the colors you really like without paying a lot of money for the ones you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>it very light weight</li>
            <li>Overall best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>I love how the liners and shadows are separate.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK because there are so many more colors to play with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-n-all, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this Coast Scents product and would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and the variety is great.</li>
            <li>but make sure you use a primer so the color won&#x27;t be fading.</li>
            <li>arrived safely and on time :)</li>
            <li>I have sooo many different choices to choose from the best part</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>love it love it...</li>
            <li>the blush and contour colors are okay.</li>
            <li>I love my palette, I am getting more into make up and wanted more colors</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love make up, and this has so many colors to choose from...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased an inexpensive makeup set that I liked!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it a lot more if it just stuck around a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, I love the variety..</li>
            <li>I actually love this make-up set.</li>
            <li>she still uses it, has just about dug all the colors out :)</li>
            <li>i saw so many reviews on youtube that i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>i probably used them more than the shadows..</li>
            <li>there are some unique colors that you will love !</li>
            <li>The shipment was ok</li>
            <li>I love this pallet.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>i love how this pallette is divided into and they also have a mirror which some brand doesnt give you.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a good palette!</li>
            <li>It was pretty good</li>
            <li>it very days,Orders a couple time.shipping is quick,Price is also good</li>
            <li>It flew all over my face which made more of a work to clean up after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product, great for creating lots of different looks.</li>
            <li>The colors are quite pigmented and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and so many different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li>you get a large variety of colors with shimmer and matt which i love!</li>
            <li>The brush included are of the cheap quality though</li>
            <li>If you dont buy this product ur really losing out!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s price and perfect for everyday or night wear!</li>
            <li>Love the vibrant colors and the easy to handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high in talcum, and rubs off very easily.  </li>
            <li>Although the colors still look very vibrant without it the primer just makes it look that much better</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use that often but wanted them for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Over all not a bad buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Certainly recommended,So far so good.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a xmas gift and it came quick.  </li>
            <li>but i kind of expected the colors to be a bit more</li>
            <li>Very pretty and versatile.  </li>
            <li>Very rich color, highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I found it online to give as xmas gifts!!  </li>
            <li>The entire kit is very slim-line and is perfect for women who travel frequently or those who often carry a tote or large purse.  </li>
            <li>, well worth</li>
            <li>but I am having a lot of fun using all of these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Good mix of loud colors and natural ones</li>
            <li>then this is right for you.</li>
            <li>This pallete is exceptional there is a wide variety of shades to choose from plus</li>
            <li>Quality product, need very little product on brush for great color.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re high pigmented and the colors are very bright and solid and last all day.</li>
            <li>Actually I didnt expect much but honestly</li>
            <li>First of all I would like to say the shipping is super fast.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of positive reviews on Youtube for this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li>First off my package took 11 days to get to me, despite the fact that my item was in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
            <li>but i am not in love with the way it will be off your eyes (especially if your eyelids are oily, like me!)</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am tan to darker shade skin toned female, and most of the colours didnt even show up on me.</li>
            <li>Two shadows were popped out when I opened it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Se likes that it has so many different eye shadow choices.</li>
            <li>works even better with the NYX white primer.</li>
            <li>So many different colors and shades blushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used regularly and love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for doing that!</li>
            <li>Everything is in a smaller size (about a dime) but there are still tons of uses, and if you run out of a colour you love, there is going to be one very close in shade in the palate.</li>
            <li>I really liked this make up, just thought it&#x27;d be a little bigger, but then I realized it&#x27;s better this way</li>
            <li>: The outside casing of the palette smudges so easily.</li>
            <li>A vast colour range easy to apply from shimmery to matte</li>
            <li>The mirror is large.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase a large sized palette for a while.</li>
            <li>Very highly pigmented&lt;br</li>
            <li>the colors were bright and I had no problems with it being too dull or it creasing</li>
            <li>which is why I really like the coast scents palette.     </li>
            <li>It was also packaged really well.  </li>
            <li>The make-up itself seems to be very high-quality and doesn&#x27;t rub off halfway through the day.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li>is I have very senstive skin</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this palette with high hopes!  </li>
            <li>But, you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really helped.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician, and these cosmetics work very well and</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the included brushes, too cheap with poor application; I threw them out and used my own brushes, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is only good if you&#x27;re buying make up for a little girls dress up kit.</li>
            <li>Not all the colors are vivid on black skin, but they&#x27;re good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>shadows dont stay for long is this original coastal sents</li>
            <li>I appreciate the dark grays and black included, great for outlining ones eyes.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and thin making it easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the color payoff as higher end pricier brands but using the right base products will give you a great look.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it everyday!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 13 yr old daughter but have been borrowing!</li>
            <li>I got this for my 11 year old because she needed new play makeup</li>
            <li>With so many color types included you can definitely cut down on your makeup</li>
            <li>Although, using a primer, or wetting the shadow (I personally don&#x27;t like to wet the shade), the true color comes out and stays on longer, especially if you live in a hot climate like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple months back with high hopes!</li>
            <li>Professional packaging</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 15 year old daughter when she was modeling.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and you get so much for so little.  </li>
            <li>The colors that are so vibrant on the pallet don&#x27;t seem to show up on my skin even though I followed the advice of the other reviews and bought the white primer so that it would show up true to color but to no avail.</li>
            <li>The color options are vibrant and vast.</li>
            <li>She had been viewing web reviews of various makeup kits and focused on this one because of good reviews regarding how well the colors last on the face and how long the makeup lasts in the kit because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint is that I wish that there were more neutral tones.  </li>
            <li>My fav is the black its really true to black pigment.</li>

            <li> Glamorous 360 Deluxe Palette ($130 Value)]]    </li>
            <li> Would not recommend based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> Nice size mirror is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sigma Makeup Travel Kit - Nice in Pink]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the colors are really nice</li>
            <li> The blushes are the perfect colors and makes my cheeks really glow.</li>
            <li> so I have to use my own.</li>
            <li> I really liked the slim compact design with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Has so many colors, good coverage when used.</li>
            <li> How nice.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> the variety is nice.  </li>
            <li> Many of my classmates also loved Coastal Scents.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely 100% pleased with the product!!!</li>
            <li> colors stay on nicely, with no irritation, but even better if you apply a primer.</li>
            <li> There are more colors then I will ever use but it is nice to have the choice.</li>
            <li> , i have even ordered for two more of these to gift to my niece&#x27;s , the colors are really good blends easily</li>
            <li> I love love love this palette!</li>
            <li> able to to many, many color combos!</li>
            <li> The blushes are awesome though, they show and highlight my face without me looking like a clown (which is easy to do with high cheek bones).</li>
            <li> Great way to find the colors you really like without paying a lot of money for the ones you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> it very light weight</li>
            <li> Overall best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I love how the liners and shadows are separate.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK because there are so many more colors to play with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-n-all, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this Coast Scents product and would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and the variety is great.</li>
            <li> but make sure you use a primer so the color won&#x27;t be fading.</li>
            <li> arrived safely and on time :)</li>
            <li> I have sooo many different choices to choose from the best part</li>
            <li> and I love it,</li>
            <li> love it love it...</li>
            <li> the blush and contour colors are okay.</li>
            <li> I love my palette, I am getting more into make up and wanted more colors</li>
            <li> AND SHE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love make up, and this has so many colors to choose from...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an inexpensive makeup set that I liked!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it a lot more if it just stuck around a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, I love the variety..</li>
            <li> I actually love this make-up set.</li>
            <li> she still uses it, has just about dug all the colors out :)</li>
            <li> i saw so many reviews on youtube that i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> i probably used them more than the shadows..</li>
            <li> there are some unique colors that you will love !</li>
            <li> The shipment was ok</li>
            <li> I love this pallet.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> i love how this pallette is divided into and they also have a mirror which some brand doesnt give you.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a good palette!</li>
            <li> It was pretty good</li>
            <li> it very days,Orders a couple time.shipping is quick,Price is also good</li>
            <li> It flew all over my face which made more of a work to clean up after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product, great for creating lots of different looks.</li>
            <li> The colors are quite pigmented and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and so many different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> you get a large variety of colors with shimmer and matt which i love!</li>
            <li> The brush included are of the cheap quality though</li>
            <li> If you dont buy this product ur really losing out!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price and perfect for everyday or night wear!</li>
            <li> Love the vibrant colors and the easy to handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high in talcum, and rubs off very easily.  </li>
            <li> Although the colors still look very vibrant without it the primer just makes it look that much better</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use that often but wanted them for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Over all not a bad buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommended,So far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a xmas gift and it came quick.  </li>
            <li> but i kind of expected the colors to be a bit more</li>
            <li> Very pretty and versatile.  </li>
            <li> Very rich color, highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I found it online to give as xmas gifts!!  </li>
            <li> The entire kit is very slim-line and is perfect for women who travel frequently or those who often carry a tote or large purse.  </li>
            <li> , well worth</li>
            <li> but I am having a lot of fun using all of these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Good mix of loud colors and natural ones</li>
            <li> then this is right for you.</li>
            <li> This pallete is exceptional there is a wide variety of shades to choose from plus</li>
            <li> Quality product, need very little product on brush for great color.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re high pigmented and the colors are very bright and solid and last all day.</li>
            <li> Actually I didnt expect much but honestly</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say the shipping is super fast.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of positive reviews on Youtube for this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li> First off my package took 11 days to get to me, despite the fact that my item was in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
            <li> but i am not in love with the way it will be off your eyes (especially if your eyelids are oily, like me!)</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am tan to darker shade skin toned female, and most of the colours didnt even show up on me.</li>
            <li> Two shadows were popped out when I opened it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Se likes that it has so many different eye shadow choices.</li>
            <li> works even better with the NYX white primer.</li>
            <li> So many different colors and shades blushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regularly and love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for doing that!</li>
            <li> Everything is in a smaller size (about a dime) but there are still tons of uses, and if you run out of a colour you love, there is going to be one very close in shade in the palate.</li>
            <li> I really liked this make up, just thought it&#x27;d be a little bigger, but then I realized it&#x27;s better this way</li>
            <li> : The outside casing of the palette smudges so easily.</li>
            <li> A vast colour range easy to apply from shimmery to matte</li>
            <li> The mirror is large.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase a large sized palette for a while.</li>
            <li> Very highly pigmented&lt;br</li>
            <li> the colors were bright and I had no problems with it being too dull or it creasing</li>
            <li> which is why I really like the coast scents palette.     </li>
            <li> It was also packaged really well.  </li>
            <li> The make-up itself seems to be very high-quality and doesn&#x27;t rub off halfway through the day.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li> is I have very senstive skin</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette with high hopes!  </li>
            <li> But, you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really helped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician, and these cosmetics work very well and</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the included brushes, too cheap with poor application; I threw them out and used my own brushes, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is only good if you&#x27;re buying make up for a little girls dress up kit.</li>
            <li> Not all the colors are vivid on black skin, but they&#x27;re good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> shadows dont stay for long is this original coastal sents</li>
            <li> I appreciate the dark grays and black included, great for outlining ones eyes.</li>
            <li> Its light weight and thin making it easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the color payoff as higher end pricier brands but using the right base products will give you a great look.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 13 yr old daughter but have been borrowing!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 11 year old because she needed new play makeup</li>
            <li> With so many color types included you can definitely cut down on your makeup</li>
            <li> Although, using a primer, or wetting the shadow (I personally don&#x27;t like to wet the shade), the true color comes out and stays on longer, especially if you live in a hot climate like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months back with high hopes!</li>
            <li> Professional packaging</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 15 year old daughter when she was modeling.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and you get so much for so little.  </li>
            <li> The colors that are so vibrant on the pallet don&#x27;t seem to show up on my skin even though I followed the advice of the other reviews and bought the white primer so that it would show up true to color but to no avail.</li>
            <li> The color options are vibrant and vast.</li>
            <li> She had been viewing web reviews of various makeup kits and focused on this one because of good reviews regarding how well the colors last on the face and how long the makeup lasts in the kit because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that I wish that there were more neutral tones.  </li>
            <li> My fav is the black its really true to black pigment.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t show well, nor do they last very long.</li>
            <li> carrying case is super slim, half an inch thick, but a bit long 9 x 6, though it fits nicely in a bigger purse without bulking it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use vivid colors in my everyday</li>
            <li> Wow, just like many reviewers stated - this product arrives with the case broken, the colors broken, smashed and mixed together.</li>
            <li> All if not most colors are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> so if there&#x27;s a color you fall-in-love with it won&#x27;t be long before you see the bottom of the tin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been big on eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This was a lot smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li> The top half of the palette does not stay up, unless it is propped up on something, which makes the mirror useless.</li>
            <li> I think that other sets may have different colors.</li>
            <li> nothing came broken , shipped fast but eye shadows are smaller</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the variety of colors but am disappointed with the actual pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Everything is at a smaller size, it is not a full size eyeshadow or blush or anything</li>
            <li> They are small but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have a wide variety of eye shadows to use,  </li>
            <li> I had bought this for the everyday wear, and wanted to save my urban decore for outtings</li>
            <li> the colors are not really pigmented and you often have to reapply eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> it was shipped quicker then expected</li>
            <li> My first pallet was broken, and Amazon.com shipped another one for me with no charge within less than 24 hour.</li>
            <li> I have a sephora palette but its really heavy, expensive and not travel friendly because it&#x27;ll crumb and crack.</li>
            <li> , that does not blend with the other eye shadows.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, an average person who throws on make up once in a while</li>
            <li> I like that the shadows don&#x27;t go on overly dark for a tween.</li>
            <li> The pots are very small and the shadows are grainy with a low pigment load.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even close to using half the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and lighter colors typically represent themselves well on me.</li>
            <li> not just that, the product it self was very dry and was very messy putting it on.</li>
            <li> otherwise you end up with a blended mess.</li>
            <li> im am a dark skin complextion and the blush work well with my skin too!</li>
            <li> Shadows are a little powdery</li>
            <li> so they get a little messy</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The colors are not rich when you wear them!</li>
            <li> I bought this make up set and just recieved it not long ago and am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The 2 applicator tips that come with the product are pointless.</li>
            <li> but you sent us a few eye brushes with this!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for the casual user.</li>
            <li> I found this kit to be pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> no more shadows and shadows !</li>
            <li> The set isn&#x27;t too terrible, but do not expect the eyeshadow to stay very well.  </li>
            <li> Not SATISFIED at ALL !!!!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> but I am still a casual user on a budget.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about it, but then I got to like it.</li>
            <li> The lock is HORRIBLE, it reminds me of a broken toggle button.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a base without a base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a really really great palette for under $20!! Its light weight and thin making it easy to travel with.  I have a sephora palette but its really heavy, expensive and not travel friendly because it&#x27;ll crumb and crack. So it sucked when I had to travel and I couldn&#x27;t have a wide variety of eye shadows to use,  which is why I really like the coast scents palette.     [[ASIN:B002YHTV8Y Sephora Brand Glamorous 360 Deluxe Palette ($130 Value)]]    They&#x27;re high pigmented and the colors are very bright and solid and last all day. the mix of matte and shimmery colors are a great combo with the liners and highlighters.   the blushes are great as well.     Overall best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> First off my package took 11 days to get to me, despite the fact that my item was in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great packaging! It was taped in bubble wrapping and arrived unbroken. The color options are vibrant and vast. The mirror is large. I love how the liners and shadows are separate. Great for beginners. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The outside casing of the palette smudges so easily. The lock is HORRIBLE, it reminds me of a broken toggle button. The colors don&#x27;t show well, nor do they last very long. I dislike at the end of each row of color there is one extra extra simmery eye shadow, that does not blend with the other eye shadows. The 2 applicator tips that come with the product are pointless. The top half of the palette does not stay up, unless it is propped up on something, which makes the mirror useless. You have to remember to blow the excess product off the palette after every use otherwise you end up with a blended mess. Not at all good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I really liked this make up, just thought it&#x27;d be a little bigger, but then I realized it&#x27;s better this way cause I don&#x27;t use a lot of colors that often so I don&#x27;t need it bigger. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of the shadows as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a xmas gift and it came quick.  It was also packaged really well.  I didn&#x27;t use it but my friend likes it.  Would recommend buying from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I bought this make up set and just recieved it not long ago and am not impressed.  The colors that are so vibrant on the pallet don&#x27;t seem to show up on my skin even though I followed the advice of the other reviews and bought the white primer so that it would show up true to color but to no avail. It could be that I have olive skin and the type of skin that seems to soak up color well, idk.  Would not recommend based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a full make up palette, this is your best choice! Affordable &amp; lovely on the skin! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a good palette! The price is great because it includes both blushes and eye shadows. Lots of colors to choose from. I bought this in February and I&#x27;m not even close to using half the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow samples aren&#x27;t big so if there&#x27;s a color you fall-in-love with it won&#x27;t be long before you see the bottom of the tin. That&#x27;s OK because there are so many more colors to play with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors stay on nicely, with no irritation, but even better if you apply a primer. I appreciate the dark grays and black included, great for outlining ones eyes. With so many color types included you can definitely cut down on your makeup clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case is super slim, half an inch thick, but a bit long 9 x 6, though it fits nicely in a bigger purse without bulking it up. Nice size mirror is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would of given this product five stars but I didn&#x27;t like the included brushes, too cheap with poor application; I threw them out and used my own brushes, [[ASIN:B002NRI3IE Sigma Makeup Travel Kit - Nice in Pink]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you need to use an eye primer because the pigment on the lighter eye shadows need help showing up. I have olive skin and lighter colors typically represent themselves well on me. Although, using a primer, or wetting the shadow (I personally don&#x27;t like to wet the shade), the true color comes out and stays on longer, especially if you live in a hot climate like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-n-all, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this Coast Scents product and would purchase from them again. Very good product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase a large sized palette for a while. There are a lot of positive reviews on Youtube for this product and the price was right. The colors are very pigmented and the variety is great. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Yes, 78 is a lot to choose from. Great colors but make sure you use a primer so the color won&#x27;t be fading.</li>
            <li> This make-up kit has a terrific array of colors to choose from, all arranged neatly by complementing blushes.  The entire kit is very slim-line and is perfect for women who travel frequently or those who often carry a tote or large purse.  The make-up itself seems to be very high-quality and doesn&#x27;t rub off halfway through the day.  All in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say the shipping is super fast. It may be different in some areas but I lived in California. I placed the order last Sunday evening and I received on Thursday. That is just amazing. I am also impressed with this palette. It got all the wonderful colors in just one palette. I will be using this palette for a while since it has all the colors I need.</li>
            <li> the colors are really nice but i kind of expected the colors to be a bit more like i quater size but they seem like nickles i like it a lot except that it looks bigger than it actually is</li>
            <li> this palette is prrreeeety! but i am not in love with the way it will be off your eyes (especially if your eyelids are oily, like me!) after 4 hours!</li>
            <li> For the $, you definitely get a lot of product.  My only issue is that the lighter colors are not as pigmented.  Great way to find the colors you really like without paying a lot of money for the ones you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This was my fave buy from amazon.  The colours are amazing, and go on nicely.  They last all day as well.  Everything is in a smaller size (about a dime) but there are still tons of uses, and if you run out of a colour you love, there is going to be one very close in shade in the palate. I would recommend this to everyone.  The price is right, and you get so much for so little.  I also bought one for my best friend as a gift and she absolutely loves it as well.</li>
            <li> A vast colour range easy to apply from shimmery to matte, well worth it&#x27;s price and perfect for everyday or night wear! arrived safely and on time :) lovee it!</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the recommendation of my sis-in-law. I am totally happy with the purchase. Fast shipping and well packed. The colors are everything I need. They are something you can use on a day to day basis and even when you go out on date nights. The blushes are the perfect colors and makes my cheeks really glow. The brush included are of the cheap quality though so I have to use my own. Over all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a great Christmas gift for my niece. She loved it and it was the start of her makeup collection. I really liked the slim compact design with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. My first pallet was broken, and Amazon.com shipped another one for me with no charge within less than 24 hour.</li>
            <li> I love love love this palette! im am a dark skin complextion and the blush work well with my skin too! My fav is the black its really true to black pigment. I have sooo many different choices to choose from the best part is I have very senstive skin n i don&#x27;t even break out!    If you dont buy this product ur really losing out!!!</li>
            <li> SO I saw the reviews and decided to but this prodcut since It looked like a great deal. But I was soo disapointed to  to know that it didnt give me the same benefits like others. I am tan to darker shade skin toned female, and most of the colours didnt even show up on me. I will never buy this product and will reccomend any one with darker shade tone not to buy it either. not just that, the product it self was very dry and was very messy putting it on. It flew all over my face which made more of a work to clean up after. Not SATISFIED at ALL !!!!! I guess I got what I paid for. I have Urban Decor eye shadows and I love it, love it love it...I had bought this for the everyday wear, and wanted to save my urban decore for outtings.. guess it was a big mistake !!!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these for gifts and the girls loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup set for my wife that would complain about not having enough makeup. With this set she has enough to combine with anything! Everything is at a smaller size, it is not a full size eyeshadow or blush or anything but it&#x27;ll last if you use all the colors and learn to mix and match. She loved it so I guess they&#x27;re good? Can&#x27;t recommend on this but seems good.</li>
            <li> nothing came broken , shipped fast but eye shadows are smaller then I thought so I gave it 4* . Over all not a bad buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My friend bought me this make-up palette for my birthday.  I like it so much that I found it online to give as xmas gifts!!  The colors are gorgeous and they are good quality pigments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great deal also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> the colors are not really pigmented and you often have to reapply eyeshadow. the blush and contour colors are okay.</li>
            <li> I bought it because a friend of mine use this brand, and I just love it! Has so many colors, good coverage when used. The colors stay as seen on the lid. I haven&#x27;t used the blushes, hope would be as the shadows.</li>
            <li> Coastal sense is no M.A.C, but look at the price. If you&#x27;re like me, an average person who throws on make up once in a while then this is right for you. I am toffee colored so I didn&#x27;t expect it to show amazingly on my skin. The blushes are awesome though, they show and highlight my face without me looking like a clown (which is easy to do with high cheek bones). The shadows did last all day without the use of primer so that&#x27;s a definite plus. If they only had the earth tone section for the price of the entire set, I&#x27;d have bought them. You can&#x27;t deny a good deal (so many colors plus blushes to coordinate with every section!)</li>
            <li> Two shadows were popped out when I opened it for the first time.  You get what you pay for.  Im buying LORAC next time</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Not all the colors are vivid on black skin, but they&#x27;re good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my palette, I am getting more into make up and wanted more colors but I am still a casual user on a budget. I don&#x27;t use vivid colors in my everyday make up so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on colors I won&#x27;t use that often but wanted them for special occasions. MUST USE primer!! Using NYX jumbo pencil in milk will help with color pay off as well. It doesn&#x27;t have the color payoff as higher end pricier brands but using the right base products will give you a great look. Definitely recommend for the casual user.</li>
            <li> Verrrrry pooor colors .and shadows dont stay for long is this original coastal sents</li>
            <li> Wow, just like many reviewers stated - this product arrives with the case broken, the colors broken, smashed and mixed together. How nice. I will listen to the reviewers in the future.</li>
            <li> Actually I didnt expect much but honestly this is a good product id recommend it to anyone , i have even ordered for two more of these to gift to my niece&#x27;s , the colors are really good blends easily</li>
            <li> I received today Coastal Scents 78 piece Makeup Palette- arrived very fast- and was wrapped in bubble wrap - was in excellent condition!!!  Love the vibrant colors and the easy to handle case- easy to keep all the makeup together- easy to use for overnite makeovers!!!  I was absolutely 100% pleased with the product!!!</li>
            <li> I found this kit to be pretty much worthless. The pots are very small and the shadows are grainy with a low pigment load. This is only good if you&#x27;re buying make up for a little girls dress up kit.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVE IT. I FEEL SO HAPPY WHIT THIS PRODUCT IT WOKS PERFECTLY. I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME. GREAT SUPPORT.</li>
            <li> I gave this set to my daughter for her birthday, and she is very happy with it. Se likes that it has so many different eye shadow choices. I like that the shadows don&#x27;t go on overly dark for a tween.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!! I love make up, and this has so many colors to choose from... I bought this because it brings highlight colors, and blush all in one... it&#x27;s great...</li>
            <li> It has everything you need ! no more shadows and shadows ! all collors in one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product, great for creating lots of different looks. The colors are quite pigmented and easy to apply.  Very pretty and versatile.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> works very well. able to to many, many color combos! perfect for day or night. The blush choices are perfect. works even better with the NYX white primer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an inexpensive makeup set that I liked!  Everything about this makeup is great.  I have never used a lot of different colors but I am having a lot of fun using all of these.  I will definitely be purchasing another Coastal Scents palette.  I do use a primer before applying and would recommend that you do the same.  Although the colors still look very vibrant without it the primer just makes it look that much better and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing. It comes just like it appear in the ad.  So many different colors and shades blushes.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette with high hopes!  But, you really get what you pay for.  The set isn&#x27;t too terrible, but do not expect the eyeshadow to stay very well.  It&#x27;s high in talcum, and rubs off very easily.  I wanted something versatile, and it is that... I&#x27;d like it a lot more if it just stuck around a bit longer.</li>
            <li> The colors are not rich when you wear them!</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup kit at my daughter&#x27;s request.  She had been viewing web reviews of various makeup kits and focused on this one because of good reviews regarding how well the colors last on the face and how long the makeup lasts in the kit because a little goes a long way.  She has been using it now for a couple of months and agrees with the reviews.  She is very pleased with the makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, I love the variety..it&#x27;s an awesome palette. I&#x27;ve never really been big on eyeshadow but once I seen the reviews I decided to try it and I love it!! YOu can create all sorts of glam!!</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months back with high hopes! I was not impressed. I was very excited about the variety of colors but am disappointed with the actual pigmentation. You can&#x27;t see any of them. I tried it with a base without a base. I&#x27;m just very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very rich color, highly pigmented. I&#x27;ve used regularly and love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 11 year old because she needed new play makeup and I didn&#x27;t want to spend much.  I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very highly pigmented&lt;br /&gt;- Good mix of loud colors and natural ones&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is well designed -- not flimsy and the logos look good&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shadows are a little powdery so they get a little messy</li>
            <li> Got this as back up for friends. And now I find myself digging Into lt. Great pallet. Great product. Fast shipping. Professional packaging</li>
            <li> I love this and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This was a lot smaller than we expected. But they are working out well. We thought we ordered enough eye brushes for this, but it turned out we didn&#x27;t. (misunderstanding about the count) but you sent us a few eye brushes with this! Thank you so much for doing that! It really helped.  I&#x27;m sure we will do business again! Thank you again.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommended,So far so good.A very good product .used it very days,Orders a couple time.shipping is quick,Price is also good</li>
            <li> I actually love this make-up set. I was very skeptical about it, but then I got to like it. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 13 yr old daughter but have been borrowing! Quality product, need very little product on brush for great color.  Nice variety.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for such a variety and amount.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she loved it! Very nice and so many different colors to choose from! I would recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for something like this one!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 15 year old daughter when she was modeling. she still uses it, has just about dug all the colors out :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this over a year ago and have loved using the variety of colors that are in the pack. They are small but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> There are more colors then I will ever use but it is nice to have the choice. Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician, and these cosmetics work very well and the variety is nice.  Many of my classmates also loved Coastal Scents.  The only complaint is that I wish that there were more neutral tones.  I think that other sets may have different colors.</li>
            <li> This pallete is exceptional there is a wide variety of shades to choose from plus it was shipped quicker then expected</li>
            <li> i saw so many reviews on youtube that i decided to buy it. you get a large variety of colors with shimmer and matt which i love! the blushers are very good i probably used them more than the shadows.. there are some unique colors that you will love !</li>
            <li> It was pretty good the colors were bright and I had no problems with it being too dull or it creasing</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, and she loved. The product is non alergic. The make up finished, get a great look. The shipment was ok</li>
            <li> Low pigment color, gave mine away</li>
            <li> I love this pallet.  All if not most colors are highly pigmented. I use it every day.  :)</li>
            <li> i love how this pallette is divided into and they also have a mirror which some brand doesnt give you. it very light weight so it great for traveling &#x3D;D</li>
