            <li>My skin is so smooth after using them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this face cream.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, light, not greasy or heavy.</li>

            <li>Great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes nicely and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying full price for Anew</li>
            <li>Nice enough, no visible results though and went very quickly</li>
            <li>I NEVER write reviews, however this product has made such an exceptional difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Although, it is well worth the full price when you see the difference it makes.</li>
            <li>Although people may not notice right away, the advertising is true on this Avon product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on well and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to find a way to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>but it always happened that it is right around when I use this cream.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel so good, but it will look alittle less wrinkled too.</li>
            <li>A decent night cream but nothing special.</li>
            <li>pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The tone is evening out, and the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have nearly vanished.  </li>
            <li>if you try it, I think you&#x27;ll come back for more.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY treatment creams and I just keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>I am on my third jar and will continue using this cream until I was to find one better which might never happen.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be back for more....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I was running low, I looked on Amazon for a better price and found it.  </li>
            <li>Many people have remarked since she&#x27;s been using this product that she looks much younger than her years.</li>
            <li>the results are noticeable fairly quickly.. be consistent..</li>
            <li>I have used many different ones throughout the years and having worked for a plastic surgeon for years having access to high end prescriptive creams..</li>
            <li>My face is super soft and feels hydrated.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good that it didn&#x27;t react negatively or have any breakouts as my skin is super sensitive, oily and prone to acne</li>
            <li>Normally Avon made good products, this is a little greasy but dry fast, the results are good in the long run.</li>
            <li>I think it really help and use it every night recommend to all my friends to use</li>
            <li>Very affordable and miracle cream.</li>
            <li>So I tried Genics and really like it.</li>
            <li>how it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like this doesn&#x27;t do anything too much for wrinkles though</li>
            <li>arrived on time and was what I expected I have been using for 3 months and love it</li>
            <li>this really works well and along with the serum..</li>
            <li>I know everyone is different and have different kind of skin.</li>
            <li>This is nice night moisturizer, doesnt feel heavy</li>
            <li>THE CONTAINER IS SMALL--- WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A SQUEEZE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t expect it to make me glow each day more than the previous day</li>
            <li>kept my skin supple and vibrant.</li>
            <li>This particular jar will go with any type of skin and any routine treatments you may use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Since using this treatment cream, my skin has become softer than when I was in High school.  </li>
            <li>Have used a couple of times and so far really like it.  </li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would be happy with some other product in it&#x27;s place..</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product when I used to sell Avon and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cream to anyone, young or old!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but I didnt notice a big overall improvement after using it for 6 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li>Even my 9 year old daughter puts it on at night.</li>
            <li>It gives that dewy, soft feeling to your skin</li>
            <li>I really like using the Anew Genics Treatment and have been for for over a year daily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for nearly a year now.</li>
            <li>I use it in intervals and not everyday.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use it, it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few weeks only so probably I cannot tell for sure</li>
            <li>Dark spots diminish in a matter of days and it is super moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I do not have any major acne issues but just hear and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used this product for years.  Is creamy and great and if you try it, I think you&#x27;ll come back for more.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, light, not greasy or heavy. Even my 9 year old daughter puts it on at night. We love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY treatment creams and I just keep coming back to this one.  It gives that dewy, soft feeling to your skin and I sure notice a difference if I am out!  I keep this one in stock and I also use it in the morning as a base cream before I use an SPF day cream.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams over the years and so far this one is the best for me. I am on my third jar and will continue using this cream until I was to find one better which might never happen.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, price and service. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Feels wonderful and smells so good!</li>
            <li> Another Avon product that do the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love the cream I think it really help and use it every night recommend to all my friends to use</li>
            <li> Smells like rotten eggs so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I received this about 1 week ago and have used it every night since. My face feels so soft and firm the next morning. Up to this point, i had been using Estee Lauder&#x27;s resilience (which costs US $89 retail) for over a decade. But, in the last year or so, i feel that Estee has lost its effectiveness for my skin so i had been thinking of a change. After doing extensive research, i decided to try Anew Genics Night Treatment Cream. So far, the results are impressive. My face has taken on a sheen and a glow. I will continue to use this and update here if there is anything further to report. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. Definitely worthwhile considering this as a Night Cream.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and miracle cream. It works perfect for thirsty skin, since the the first application you can see the difference</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market for treatment of aging skin and the onset of wrinkles. Try it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just love Anew Genics by Avon.  Since using this treatment cream, my skin has become softer than when I was in High school.  I definitely have less little lines too!  Even my husband noticed!  I am totally hooked on this product.  I think it&#x27;s the best one that Avon makes (and I have tried several of them).  Doesn&#x27;t have too much scent, and just glides on nicely!  I would highly recommend this cream to anyone, young or old!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Great moisturizer.  Great price.  Use it every night and it lasts about a month. Definite difference in my skin. Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different and have different kind of skin. My skin is dry and prone to breakouts and this cream has increased my breakouts and hence 2stars.</li>
            <li> the anew line I been using for years and love it,  great price also,  I&#x27;m 66 and this night produce actually works,  does what is written</li>
            <li> Have used a couple of times and so far really like it.  Absorbs well and skin feels good afterward.  Have not used it enough time to expect to see results yet.</li>
            <li> Genics Night Cream feels smooth on my skin and I don&#x27;t have that heavy feeling that some products have. It also has a nice fragrance. I must use a cream after cleansing as my skin is dry and feels as though it is pulling.  This works great. I have used Plantinum Night cream for a couple of years, but it always rolls up in little balls on my skin if I rub it. ??? So I tried Genics and really like it.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and have dry skin and dark spots. I was introduced to this product when I used to sell Avon and cannot live without it. I am no longer an Avon rep but looooooove this product. Dark spots diminish in a matter of days and it is super moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this night cream for some time.. It works quite well.  My skin is smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;and looks healthy.  The Anew products are very good.</li>
            <li> I find it good. It&#x27;s thick but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any visible wrinkles so I don&#x27;t know how it really works.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice night cream.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks only so probably I cannot tell for sure but my skin does look brighter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Will buy again,.</li>
            <li> A decent night cream but nothing special. It is less expensive than department store brands that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Anew Genics Treatment and have been for for over a year daily.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would be happy with some other product in it&#x27;s place..</li>
            <li> This cream does what it says it does. Great moisturizer for dry skin. Not greasy or heavy. Goes on well and is absorbed quickly. You won&#x27;t look 20 again but your skin will look better.</li>
            <li> Great product, great experience. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years.  I love it.  It makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for nearly a year now. Within a couple of months, people began telling me how good, young, etc. I look. My turkey neck has disappeared! In case you might think I&#x27;m younger and don&#x27;t have serious problems with wrinkles, you need to know that I just turned 67.  I&#x27;ve been paying full price for Anew and I&#x27;m happy to find a way to save a few bucks. Although, it is well worth the full price when you see the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple of weeks and have seen no significant changes. May have to wait a little longer. But it&#x27;s good that it didn&#x27;t react negatively or have any breakouts as my skin is super sensitive, oily and prone to acne</li>
            <li> Great product. II have tried the samle sizes and loved this night time cream.  I could NOT believe the price on Amazon.  I will be back for more....Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product! Moisturizes nicely and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. Using it regularly seems to lighten up the dark spots and sun damage for me.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WORKS VERY GOOD FOR FACE CREAM.</li>
            <li> Normally Avon made good products, this is a little greasy but dry fast, the results are good in the long run.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product when I first ordered from my Avon rep.  When I was running low, I looked on Amazon for a better price and found it.  This is a great night cream for anyone 45+ years old.  My skin is so soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> It has not made all the wrinkles go away, but my skin feels good.  I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. After 3 weeks, my skin looks smooth and supple.  I am 68.</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews, however this product has made such an exceptional difference in my skin, I thought I just needed to!  I was looking for a product line that wasn&#x27;t as pricey as some of the department store brands, namely Estee Lauder, which have incredible products, but huge price tags.  I ordered this cream with the serum, day cream and eye cream.  I am 33 and my skin now has this luminous quality it was definitely missing.  The tone is evening out, and the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have nearly vanished.  Will order again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturiser and I have used it for years. It makes a difference in my skin and it&#x27;s noticeable if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> On time - as advertised</li>
            <li> kept my skin supple and vibrant. love it.  now, my mom, sis, sis in law and i all use this product. pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the second times I bought this product. My mom looks ten years younger.</li>
            <li> Nice enough, no visible results though and went very quickly</li>
            <li> I love all anew Genics products. My skin is so smooth after using them. Pricey, but still cheaper than dept. store products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this face cream. It hydrates, smooths, and refreshes skin making it look years younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for the past week but I love the way it makes my face feel. My face is super soft and feels hydrated.  It also has a pleasant smell as well, not too potent either. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD. SEEMS TO BE WORKING- BUT ONLY HAVE BEEN USING ABOUT 2 WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS I GET IT IN MY FINGERNAIL THE CONTAINER IS SMALL--- WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A SQUEEZE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for few months now. Even though i haven&#x27;t seen any visible results I like this cream. It moisturizes my face. I use it day n night. I apply it before i put my makeup. It doesnt make my face oily at all even at the end of the day. This is my favorite face cream.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for about 2 years and she and I believe that it does wonders for her skin. Many people have remarked since she&#x27;s been using this product that she looks much younger than her years. It may be herititary, in her genes or in the cream. A husband never questions the compliments or the genes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t liked AVON creams until this one.  Amazing results and I have seen visible difference.  Also, does not make my face breakout.  Also, like the eye night cream as well.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is nice night moisturizer, doesnt feel heavy and I don&#x27;t wake up greasy which is awesome since I have such oily skin; but I still like the concentrate even at night. I feel like this doesn&#x27;t do anything too much for wrinkles though</li>
            <li> This is great night cream, my skin felt wonderful in the morning. Very moisturizing, but I didnt notice a big overall improvement after using it for 6 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 months now and I like it. I have no signs of aging or wrinkles at 35 and people always mistake me as in mid 20s.I use it in intervals and not everyday. Whenever I use it, it makes my skin soft and I wake up with a glow. I see that for 2-3 days and then it&#x27;s normal. Can&#x27;t expect it to make me glow each day more than the previous day or I might become bright like sun one day :). The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I break out when I use this cream. I do not have any major acne issues but just hear and there due to hormones I guess but it always happened that it is right around when I use this cream. It cannot be an accident that 10 out 10 times it was something other than the cream. I have a very sensitive skin so thought my review might help those who deal with it.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and was what I expected I have been using for 3 months and love it</li>
            <li> Although people may not notice right away, the advertising is true on this Avon product.  The key is consistentcy. Your face will feel so good, but it will look alittle less wrinkled too. I use it day and night. Most people tell me I do not look my age. This particular jar will go with any type of skin and any routine treatments you may use. I am not an Avon representative.</li>
            <li> Love..this cream.. I have used many different ones throughout the years and having worked for a plastic surgeon for years having access to high end prescriptive creams.. this really works well and along with the serum.. the results are noticeable fairly quickly.. be consistent.. wash face.. use serum.. then night cream.. easy.. wort it... and wow I was happy at the price on amazon.. no diss to Avon.. but I&#x27;m loving Amazon for most stuff lol. Happy with this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  The price is even better.</li>
            <li> This cream is very good really helps with wrinkles, but kind of grease for my oil skin!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this night cream. It is heavy, but moisturizes well during bedtime. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I have used night moisturizers from Macy&#x27;s etc over the years and this product is equal . The price is great! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
