            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found these products.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Microdermabrasion cream at a great discounted price.</li>
            <li>This cream works great.</li>
            <li>and I have contemplated it since her skin looks so great afterwards, but</li>
            <li>Love this stuff works very good</li>
            <li>The cream made my face tingle with like a cooling sensation that felt good.</li>
            <li>I know I received it for a good a price</li>
            <li>and of course loved it.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Microdermabrasion Cream from Candid Essentials for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and best part is there is no perfume smell or any smell of any kind .</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Everyone need to treat their face to a microdermabrasion and when I was given a chance to try this product to give my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I tried the microdermabrasion cream because it had been a while since I had a face scrub or any kind of treatment for that matter.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in this Microdermabrasion by Candid Essentials!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s when I clean my face, and it was so nice!</li>
            <li>I felt like the sun was shining on my face because my skin felt so good and clean.</li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion cream itself was very light but refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You then can either wipe off with a cloth or tissue, or in my opinion it&#x27;s better if you rinse it off your face with a damp cloth or splashing water on your face.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast ship.</li>
            <li>So most of the time i avoid them.</li>
            <li>And I think my skin looks more toned and &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, twice weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is OK.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this during a product launch!  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and rinse off!  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a great microdermabrasion cream for my face because regular store bought</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Microdermabrasion Cream from Candid Essentials for anyone who wants a great light scrub for their face.</li>
            <li>However, once you use it, as I said before, u can feel the cream working as it&#x27;s meant to and makes your skin feel more alive, cleaner &amp; more healthy.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>The day after using my face feel smooth, clean,clear and fresh,black heads are gone.</li>
            <li>CANDID Microdermabrasion creme is gentle on my skin and my skin feels really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>After going through so many different face scrubs I have found my favorite microdermabrasion!</li>
            <li>my face feels so clean and refreshed as well.</li>
            <li>Seems to be like most scrubs, haven&#x27;t really seen any difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of abrasions to wash my face though I think they are good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>This is a good size jar so it should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>However, when given the opportunity  to review Candid Essentials&#x27; Microdermabrasion cream I jumped at the chance because I have found their other products to be so high in quality and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>and I am sure the results will be just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>This scrub is exactly what i was lacking!</li>
            <li>This is smooth, gentle, and I really feel comfortable using this on my skin.</li>
            <li>the candid essential face lotion nd</li>
            <li>When I want a lighter cleaning I dilute with more water (keep my skin more wet) or if I want a deeper scrub</li>
            <li>This allows your other skincare products to absorb more readily into you skin for better results and a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great cream that I will definitely keep in my daily face care routine!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; stuff is so fine it is almost a soft feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a microdermabrasion creme</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like facial scrubs; this one is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this scrub my skin was brighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>This product feels exactly like products I had before with my cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions and just put about a dime sized amount on each of my index fingers and then scrubbed it in all over my face, and my skin felt so soft &amp; smooth after washing it off</li>
            <li>I have tried a gazillion anti-wrinkle and firming creams, pore reducers and skin tighteners - some moderately priced, some cheap, and some way too expensive - and I have to say that this cream does in fact give you the best microdermabrasion simulation that I have tried yet!  </li>
            <li>After using this face scrub my face is smooth, feels clean, feels healthy, no break outs, black heads and white heads are gone!</li>
            <li>But I always wished I could do it at home and finally my dream came true!</li>
            <li>Now using both has really brightened my complexion!  highly recommended.</li>
            <li>well, there wasn&#x27;t really any scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>It left my skin so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>figured I would give this a shot first and WOW!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It helped bring new life to my face!</li>
            <li>When you first apply it on your face you might feel a little gritty feeling as you are working it around your entire face , but it feels very nice and once rinsed</li>
            <li>This creme will gently remove the top layer of dead skin from your face.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s highly abrasive.</li>
            <li>can recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product based on its gentleness and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh, I use it on my neck and chest area and, as per the instructions, do not scrub it, but use it with a gentle circular motion for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>and I noticed when I opened the container/jar - the product was NOT filled to the top.  </li>
            <li>My sister has the real thing done pretty regularly</li>
            <li>It leaves a fine layer of moisturization on your face after using which I really really like since Microderm abrasion is a bit harsh on your face.</li>
            <li>I used my normal moisturizer afterwards, and my face was so soft!  </li>
            <li>My face felt so soft and renewed!</li>
            <li>My skin feel so soft now!.</li>
            <li>It smooths out my skin and removes all the dead top cells that clog up my pores but is gentle enough for me to use every day.</li>
            <li>noticed a reduction in fine lines, a shrinkage of pores on my nose and and dark spots and scars have been fading!</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I use on my face only because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it if your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>The cream is gritty feeling, in order to take the old layer of skin and impurities off and bring a new, smoother layer to the surface.</li>
            <li>This creme reminds me of higher end scrubs from the cosmetic counters at department stores; certainly not from the make up aisle at a big box store.</li>
            <li>Well on top of my sensitive skin, I get black heads, white heads and dead skin.</li>
            <li>This product has a fine gritty texture to it that is non irritating.  </li>

            <li> This product has a fine gritty texture to it that is non irritating.  </li>
            <li> so it does get a little red afterwards but goes away after an hour, and I can tell you that the real microderm treatments do leave you red for the day, so this is a much less invasive &amp; harsh way to remove the dead skin cells from your top dermis layers.</li>
            <li> Gently rub a small amount around your face in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry skin all winter here in the midwest, and have just about had enough.  </li>
            <li> I received it as a gift after nagging my husband for so long because I use their Vitamin c Serum and lotion and they work so well together.  </li>
            <li> This is VERY abrading, so be careful not to rub too hard.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin use this nd</li>
            <li> I am African American with eczema and this product is not to harsh or drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and this is definitely part of my weekly skin care routine.</li>
            <li> scrubs are too rough on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too rough for my skin</li>
            <li> Only takes a few minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I could be missing it, but not anywhere can I find where the label states for how long to apply the microdermabrasion lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face scrubs but they never seem to do the job and my skin would break out.</li>
            <li> All the little dry patches on my face (like the balls of my cheeks, my T-zone), were GONE.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to have an average one.</li>
            <li> It gave me the impression that it had already been used prior because some of the product was missing at least 1/8 to 1/4 of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now a little over three months and the difference is visible.</li>
            <li> it is too soon to tell - I  have just been using the product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Think of it as you are scrubbing away dead skin.</li>
            <li> remove dead skin so well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like  super grainy tough scrubs that make me feel like I&#x27;ve done something bad to my skin.</li>
            <li> When you put the cream on your face it feels like you have tiny little rocks on your face, but it is not in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> Avoid your eyes and mouth area because the skin is too delicate and you don&#x27;t want to stretch your skin out.  </li>

            <li> This is great!  It has shrunk my pores since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I received it as a gift after nagging my husband for so long because I use their Vitamin c Serum and lotion and they work so well together.  Now using both has really brightened my complexion!  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. The only problem I have run into is with the directions. I could be missing it, but not anywhere can I find where the label states for how long to apply the microdermabrasion lotion.</li>
            <li> This scrub is exactly what i was lacking! It helped bring new life to my face! It left my skin so soft and healthy. Everyone was complimenting me on how my skin was glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a reduction in fine lines, a shrinkage of pores on my nose and and dark spots and scars have been fading! I am so happy to recieve this microdermabrasion cream to review. It&#x27;s really a great cream that I will definitely keep in my daily face care routine!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a microdermabrasion creme and i do like it. When you first apply it on your face you might feel a little gritty feeling as you are working it around your entire face , but it feels very nice and once rinsed my face feels so clean and refreshed as well. I have only been using it for 5 days and have noticed a difference in the way my face feels. I will continue to use this until it is all gone .  It leaves my face feeling clean and best part is there is no perfume smell or any smell of any kind .</li>
            <li> I love it. If you have dry skin use this nd the candid essential face lotion nd you will not have any problems with your skin anymore...I want to buy the vitamin C serum they carry as well now. I&#x27;m so happy I found these products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works very good</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a great microdermabrasion cream for my face because regular store bought scrubs are too rough on my face. So when I was offered this Microdermabrasion Cream from Candid Essentials for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it I had to try it out. I used it on my face during my shower, cause that&#x27;s when I clean my face, and it was so nice! The smell,  well, there wasn&#x27;t really any scent at all.  The microdermabrasion cream itself was very light but refreshing. My face felt so soft and renewed! I definitely recommend this Microdermabrasion Cream from Candid Essentials for anyone who wants a great light scrub for their face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Microdermabrasion cream at a great discounted price. This cream works great. I put it on my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin areas. You wanna stay away from your eye and mouth areas. The application process feels a bit like rubbing grit on your face. The cream is gritty feeling, in order to take the old layer of skin and impurities off and bring a new, smoother layer to the surface. You apply it and then work it into your skin in a rotating fashion. You then can either wipe off with a cloth or tissue, or in my opinion it&#x27;s better if you rinse it off your face with a damp cloth or splashing water on your face. Once rinsed off, you can basically automatically start to feel that your skin feels smoother, healthier. It may take some people a couple uses of this cream, in order to get used to the grittiness of it. However, once you use it, as I said before, u can feel the cream working as it&#x27;s meant to and makes your skin feel more alive, cleaner &amp; more healthy. I would definitely recommend this Microdermabrasion cream to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too rough for my skin and I seem to have an average one. Don&#x27;t buy it if your skin is sensitive it&#x27;s highly abrasive.</li>
            <li> Works great! U can actually see results after one use.. My face appeared cleaner and brighter&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definately buy this again!</li>
            <li> Seems to be like most scrubs, haven&#x27;t really seen any difference but it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This Microdermabrasion creme is meant for weekly use.  Gently rub a small amount around your face in a circular motion.  Avoid your eyes and mouth area because the skin is too delicate and you don&#x27;t want to stretch your skin out.  This creme will gently remove the top layer of dead skin from your face.  This allows your other skincare products to absorb more readily into you skin for better results and a youthful appearance.  This product has a fine gritty texture to it that is non irritating.  It is gentle and effective.  I purchased this product during a promotion for trial and review.  I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Great product, fast ship. Thanks!</li>
            <li> it is too soon to tell - I  have just been using the product for a few weeks.  It is gentle and feels good on the skin. It is too soon to see results</li>
            <li> Does not work at all.  Tried for 10 days no difference at all.  Would never recommend.</li>
            <li> Everyone need to treat their face to a microdermabrasion and when I was given a chance to try this product to give my honest and unbiased opinion I jumped on it. I am very picky about what I use on my face only because I have sensitive skin. Well on top of my sensitive skin, I get black heads, white heads and dead skin. I have tried other face scrubs but they never seem to do the job and my skin would break out. After using this scrub my face loves it! After using this face scrub my face is smooth, feels clean, feels healthy, no break outs, black heads and white heads are gone! After going through so many different face scrubs I have found my favorite microdermabrasion! I highly recommend this brand! Try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> This Microderm abrasion cream is excellent. Not only does it give you the micro dermabrasion, but it moisturizes and hydrates your face at the same time since the cream is so buttery and creamy. It leaves a fine layer of moisturization on your face after using which I really really like since Microderm abrasion is a bit harsh on your face. A little bit goes a long way and this is definitely part of my weekly skin care routine. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of abrasions to wash my face though I think they are good for exfoliating. So most of the time i avoid them. However, when given the opportunity  to review Candid Essentials&#x27; Microdermabrasion cream I jumped at the chance because I have found their other products to be so high in quality and pleasant to use. I was not disappointed in this Microdermabrasion by Candid Essentials! The &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; stuff is so fine it is almost a soft feel to my skin. It is very pleasant to use. Not at all offensive to my skin. And I think my skin looks more toned and &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, twice weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works just as described. I&#x27;ve been using it now a little over three months and the difference is visible. It is not harsh, I use it on my neck and chest area and, as per the instructions, do not scrub it, but use it with a gentle circular motion for a couple of minutes. My skin feel so soft now!. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried the microdermabrasion cream because it had been a while since I had a face scrub or any kind of treatment for that matter. I applied the cream on forehead, cheeks and chin area. When you put the cream on your face it feels like you have tiny little rocks on your face, but it is not in a bad way.  Think of it as you are scrubbing away dead skin. The cream made my face tingle with like a cooling sensation that felt good. I rinsed it off and applied moisturizing cream. I felt like the sun was shining on my face because my skin felt so good and clean. If you want that same feeling try it out for yourself. I know I received it for a good a price and I wanted to share my experience.</li>
            <li> I really like facial scrubs; this one is gentle and effective. I don&#x27;t like  super grainy tough scrubs that make me feel like I&#x27;ve done something bad to my skin. CANDID Microdermabrasion creme is gentle on my skin and my skin feels really clean afterwards. This creme reminds me of higher end scrubs from the cosmetic counters at department stores; certainly not from the make up aisle at a big box store. This is smooth, gentle, and I really feel comfortable using this on my skin. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product during a promotion. I highly recommend this product based on its gentleness and effectiveness. I plan to purchase it again when this jar runs out!</li>
            <li> After the first use of this scrub my skin was brighter and smoother.  My pores even appear to be smaller.  I have been using it twice a week for almost two weeks and I can see a big difference in my skin&#x27;s  texture and brightness.  I am African American with eczema and this product is not to harsh or drying on my skin.  Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The day after using my face feel smooth, clean,clear and fresh,black heads are gone.</li>
            <li> This product was not in a box and I noticed when I opened the container/jar - the product was NOT filled to the top.  It gave me the impression that it had already been used prior because some of the product was missing at least 1/8 to 1/4 of the product.</li>
            <li> This is VERY abrading, so be careful not to rub too hard.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smooths out my skin and removes all the dead top cells that clog up my pores but is gentle enough for me to use every day. When I want a lighter cleaning I dilute with more water (keep my skin more wet) or if I want a deeper scrub I keep my face just moist before I put it on. Only takes a few minutes a day.</li>
            <li> This product is OK. No benefits to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this during a product launch!  I have struggled with dry skin all winter here in the midwest, and have just about had enough.  I used this microdermabrasion just before jumping in the shower.  It&#x27;s super easy to use and rinse off!  I used my normal moisturizer afterwards, and my face was so soft!  All the little dry patches on my face (like the balls of my cheeks, my T-zone), were GONE.  This is a good size jar so it should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I used to go to go once a month to have microdermabrasion sessions with my cosmetologist and of course loved it. But I always wished I could do it at home and finally my dream came true! This product feels exactly like products I had before with my cosmetologist. The only difference is that she was using machine and I am using fingers. I am patiently rubbing it in circular motions around my face and neck the same way she did, spending at least 5-7 minutes doing it, making sure the dead skin is off. I will be doing it once a week, like I have been doing with my cosmetologist and I am sure the results will be just as good if not better. Finally, spa at home!</li>
            <li> I have tried a gazillion anti-wrinkle and firming creams, pore reducers and skin tighteners - some moderately priced, some cheap, and some way too expensive - and I have to say that this cream does in fact give you the best microdermabrasion simulation that I have tried yet!  My sister has the real thing done pretty regularly and I have contemplated it since her skin looks so great afterwards, but figured I would give this a shot first and WOW!  My skin has never felt softer.  I didn&#x27;t even read the instructions and just put about a dime sized amount on each of my index fingers and then scrubbed it in all over my face, and my skin felt so soft &amp; smooth after washing it off that I don&#x27;t even care if that is the incorrect way to apply it!  I have pretty sensitive skin so it does get a little red afterwards but goes away after an hour, and I can tell you that the real microderm treatments do leave you red for the day, so this is a much less invasive &amp; harsh way to remove the dead skin cells from your top dermis layers. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> remove dead skin so well</li>
