            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit too high on the head.</li>
            <li>the crystals on it just sparkled and is a head turner by far.</li>
            <li>the tiara is VERY flimsily, the entire thing twists and bends like playdough.  </li>
            <li>The beauty and brilliance of the tiara far surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my niece who is celebrating her sweet 16 in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The combs on the tiara are like twisted wire and very easy to bend.  </li>

            <li> the crystals on it just sparkled and is a head turner by far.</li>
            <li> the tiara is VERY flimsily, the entire thing twists and bends like playdough.  </li>
            <li> The beauty and brilliance of the tiara far surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece who is celebrating her sweet 16 in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The combs on the tiara are like twisted wire and very easy to bend.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my month long birthday celebration .</li>
            <li> It looks big in the picture, but it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> It looks expensive, but was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong, the crown is very sparkly</li>

            <li> It is not too heavy</li>
            <li> The metal of the headband is softer than lead (though not so heavy, of course), though.  </li>
            <li> It did have one jewel missing from one of the arches</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big and flashy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stick up too far to make it uncomfortable to obnoxious!  </li>
            <li> Like seriously you can bend this tiara into WHATEVER SHAPE YOU WANT!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive and it sparkles when the light hits. This tiara is perfect.</li>
            <li> Hi! I really love this tiara, but before I buy it, IÂ´d like to know its height and length.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was very pretty but too big for what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> It is very sparkly and beautiful. Doesn&#x27;t sit too high on the head. The tiara is very flexible so it will fit any head. However, when I recieved it there were a few stones that had already came off and where rolling around in the case it came with.</li>
            <li> Love! Very pretty and sits nicely and is very sparkly. I bought for my month long birthday celebration . Wore it until my actual birthday .i wore my larger tiara for that occasion. This one kind of reminds me of Princess Diana&#x27;s tiara quite a bit</li>
            <li> The Tiara Is Very Beautiful And Has A Great Shine To It. I Just Wish I Had Read The Discription Better. Its Smaller Than I Thought.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my daughter for a play she is in, looked beautiful, First time she wore it, it broke right near the start of the crystals on the side.  $35 down the drain and no prop for the play. She is 39 by the way so not misused by a child.</li>
            <li> I love the tiara!!! It will be a great addition to my dress for my big day. It more pretty in person. Get buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Tiara for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  It was very nice and high quality. It was a Hit at the party!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one.  Just to wear around the house. This product fells sturdy and like quality. Little hard to wear with short hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s Quince celebration. She looked beautiful in it; just the right size and bling for a 15 year old without looking tacky or pageant-like. We selected this one after looking at a LOT of tiaras on many websites. We never regretted it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter to wear in her wedding.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  Well made and sparkly!!  Would definitely buy again. Very Pleased!!</li>
            <li> As a former beauty queen, I&#x27;m no stranger to tiaras! I purchased this tiara for a Sweet 16 Tiara/Crowning Ceremony and it is very beautiful and dainty. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Super sparkly, and perfect for a grown up to wear.  Very sturdy and I could bend the band to fit my head exactly.</li>
            <li> This Tiara matches my necklace set so grand. The setting of the crystal are of royal delight. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this tiara at my wedding! Thanks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get by ordering a tiara online....well it is beautiful.  It is sparkly, well made, and the hair clips work.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Planning a wedding isnt easy, especially trying to find the perfect wedding acessories. i saw this crown while shopping and was just amazed at how beautiful it was so when i finally received it just took my breath away. the crystals on it just sparkled and is a head turner by far. i love it.</li>
            <li> Great quality for such a low price. It is flexible and adjusts to any size head. A definite great buy!!</li>
            <li> Stunning Tiara.  Bought it for a birthday gift and they were estatic on how amazing it looked.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that people took the time to review this previously.  I absolutely love my tiara and can not wait for my special day.  I looked all over bridal shops and the internet and to buy something that I knew I would be thrilled with was going to be costly.  I was so very excited to open the box and try this beautiful, great quality shiny tiara on.  It is perfect.  It looks expensive, but was so reasonable.  I highly recommend! No reason to break the bank when you can buy one of these and look just as beautiful.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TIARA, IT IS WAY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE PICTURE, IT WILL MAKE MY WEDDING DAY EVEN MORE SPECIAL!!</li>
            <li> This is very sparkly!  And it is lower profile, so it doesn&#x27;t stick up too far to make it uncomfortable to obnoxious!  It worked well for my wedding.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This crown looks exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The crown was put together wonderfully and the price was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Even better it arrived 3 days early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be beautiful and very sparkly for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday party. As soon as we got it out of the box it was crooked, I tried to bend it into place and it snapped on one side. It is very pretty and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> It looks big in the picture, but it&#x27;s so small, I thought It was big but I was wrong, the crown is very sparkly came in good condition but it bends so easy , it&#x27;s so easy to brake it! I didn&#x27;t like it at all,</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Very good craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself for my bday and it is honestly just stunning. It&#x27;s sparkly and just seriously beautiful. But it arrived with a diamond part missing and it doesn&#x27;t fit on my head right. It&#x27;s bent funny. It&#x27;s too pricy for the quality in my opinion but is truly the prettiest crown I&#x27;ve ever worn for my bday, which I do every year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a breathtaking addition to my wedding attire! I have tried it on several occasions taken it out to see the beauty all over again. Can&#x27;t wait until December 7, 2013. It does fit  securely to my head, and I&#x27;m glad that the quality is there for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blushing Bride 2013</li>
            <li> The tiara is pretty.  BUT! the tiara is VERY flimsily, the entire thing twists and bends like playdough.  That&#x27;s not gonna work when it will need to be handled to fix it properly on my head for wedding day. The tiara would twist apart!  Like seriously you can bend this tiara into WHATEVER SHAPE YOU WANT! You could make a headband, a wrist cuff, you can make a heart shape out of the tiara, that&#x27;s a cool trick but not what I needed this for. Returning...</li>
            <li> This is my second one because I LOVE THEM! I got one to wear on the plane and one for my day. This is my day one. It&#x27;s not too big and flashy. It&#x27;s just enough to feel beautiful and extra special.</li>
            <li> This tiara made my special day very much more special! I wore this to my wedding vow renewal, in which I never got to wear a white wedding dress and tiara. It really made my day; I am also rightfully allowed to wear one, as my family came from royalty.</li>
            <li> At our house we have what I call \\&quot;Tiara Day\\&quot;. If I am wearing the tiara, everyone has to do what Mom says without arguing or complaining. I love those days, but I don&#x27;t abuse the privilege. This is the tiara I wear. It is beautiful and well made. It is not too heavy yet it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to fall off of my head. I can wear it all day without any problems. You just feel pretty when you are wearing it! I would highly recommend it to every Mom! I would highly recommend tiara day as well!</li>
            <li> I really love this tiara in my wedding day, a lot of people love it too, it is so shining and it made me so      special during my wedding. It is prefect match my wedding dress, it let me look like a princess. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my wedding. I wanted a tiara that looked sparkly and princessy and this tiara is exactly that. It is shiny enough to bling at all angles. The price was great and looks worth more than I paid. I am soon happy!</li>
            <li> Super product, with the price and quality! Great transaction!</li>
            <li> The combs on the tiara are like twisted wire and very easy to bend.  I feel like it could break very easily when used.  The overall look of the tiara is very pretty and sits well on the head.  The graduated band is nice as it makes the tiara stand straight on the head instead of leaning backwards as regular band tiaras.  Will need to take great care when putting it on and storing it so the combs do not break.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this many times for our Queens and everyone gives the girls compliments. Holds up to wearing it multiple times which is a plus if this is for someone who needs it to last for multiple apprearances.</li>
            <li> Everyone thet see this Tiara love it. Look very nice. Hi recomend for any sweet 15 or 16. Ship on time.</li>
            <li> I really loved this item and I am using it as my headpiece for my wedding. The only thing is that one of the stones popped out but I was able to put it back in. It&#x27;s very shinny and it goes peferct with my dress. I can not wait to wear it for my June wedding.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece who is celebrating her sweet 16 in a few weeks.  She loved it!  So did her mother!!!</li>
            <li> It sparkles and looks amazing.  The metal of the headband is softer than lead (though not so heavy, of course), though.  It is very, very malleable--my touch easily bent it--and the some of the joints between the stones broke almost immediately.  We&#x27;ll have to solder it back together. . .</li>
            <li> large and beautiful...much prettier than some found in store.  It did have one jewel missing from one of the arches but it did not look like it feel out.  Overall very pretty..</li>
            <li> One or two of the gems fell out before I even got to wear it for my wedding, but fortunately you couldn&#x27;t tell. It is a perfect size for a wedding tiara.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the female guests for a 60th birthday party. The beauty and brilliance of the tiara far surpassed my expectations. It transforms you into a princess when u put it on. It is very well made and stunning in appearance. It was one of the highlights of the party. I highly recommend this product for any occasion, wedding, prom or fun occasions as I did for a birthday party. We are all planning other events we can wear it too!</li>
            <li> Soooo I have been looking all over for a pretty crown to get for my friend who was getting married, it was between this crown and another. But something told me to get this crown, it is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!! Its very light weight which was surprising however, when my friend placed it on her head when she had her wedding gown on, she looked so elegant!</li>
            <li> blingy and nice. more comfy than most other tiaras i tried on. even though i didnt wear this one on the day of the wedding, i would def recommend this</li>
            <li> looks beautiful. curve is just right to fit on your head. very sparkly. cant wait to wear it on my wedding day. Bought one for 200 before this one is better.</li>
            <li> I love this Tiara. I ordered this to use as a cake top for a friends birthday cake. I needed a tiara that has lots of bling, shine and not plastic looking. I&#x27;m so glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Product, price and delivery exceeded my expectations. Fast delivery and the tiara is gorgeous...exceptionally sparkly! I needed to find one last minute for a costume party. I received a ton of compliments at the party and all the girls there said they wanted one for themselves. I&#x27;m looking for a reason to wear it again. Until then, it has a special place on my shelf. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wedding day , wasn&#x27;t holding my breath for anything special considering the low price. Boy was I wrong! It is the most beautiful sparkly tiara! Doesn&#x27;t look cheap at a, and easily pliable, for different head sizes. The comes are lacking sure, but what bride isn&#x27;t going to pin them in anyhow? Love it, November can&#x27;t come soon enough!!</li>
