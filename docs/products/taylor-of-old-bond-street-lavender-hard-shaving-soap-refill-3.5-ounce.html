    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this and a brush (Edwin Jagger Best Badger).</li>
            <li>But now, it is without a doubt the BEST way to go!</li>
            <li>And the smell is MAGNIFICENT!</li>
            <li>They have a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Husband loves this and he smells wonderful when he uses it.  </li>
            <li>It lubes the razor like a champ and leaves your skin moisturized and feeling great.</li>
            <li>Nice lather, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>And boy is it nice!</li>
            <li>Produces a great nice smelling lather.  </li>
            <li>Makes a good lather.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s mild on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my very favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The smell was great, however, for me it did not give nearly as smooth a shave as the Proraso.</li>
            <li>It came in a nice package.</li>
            <li>Pretty good shaving soap!</li>
            <li>By far this is the best shave soap out there, believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>replaces Art of Shaving soap perfectly, good quality and soothing light lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nice, smells great, and high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent, lathers into a rich lather and provides good protection for the skin.  </li>
            <li>or so I like to pull this stuff out like a bottle of fine brandy and treat myself to something nice.</li>
            <li>Picked up this soap after reading up on many internet sites.  </li>
            <li>but he used it and told me he likes it better than everything else he  has tried.</li>
            <li>give me a better lather.</li>
            <li>for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving! :-)</li>
            <li>Taylor of OB is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they made more of their scents in soap versus cream.</li>
            <li>This is much better than a glycerine based soap.</li>
            <li>I love ToBS.</li>
            <li>Love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Great scent, good foam, and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>The cake is larger than Colonel Conk, which measured 2-1/2&amp;#34; and fit perfectly in my shaving mug.  </li>
            <li>This really gets into the skin good.</li>
            <li>A nice shave has a way to start the day off right, and Taylor&#x27;s lavender soap does just that.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Wish the original sale promotion on the Amazon site was much more explanatory as to what type and size of soap bowl or mug that this would fit.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Art of Shaving Soap and was rather pretty happy with it until found a better soap in OLD bond;  the lavender Taylor of Old Bond Shaving soap is the best I have found;  I do use preshave oil that I make myself since they cost 7-10 times as much in stores ($20</li>
            <li>It worked fine, but it was a bit of work.  </li>
            <li>Just a little water and a warm-soaked shave brush will create an awesome lather to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheap soaps</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a fantastic close shave I get using it.</li>
            <li>I chose lavender as it is touted as a good scent to use for those with sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is very economical.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty good too, I just liked the other one better.  </li>
            <li>The lather is so rich the blade glides effortlessly over my face.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, I have also tried lavender soap from The Art of Shaving (AOS), which resulted in significant irritation than the Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) soap and is more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent, more importantly, the wife does too.</li>
            <li>so I have to lather one twice per pass, while the conk can do a full pass without reapplication.</li>
            <li>this item here is hands down the best; even if it is perhaps not much smoother than the Art of Shaving Soap BUT is sure looks (maintains purple color) and smells much stronger of lavender and better &#x3D; more luxurious.</li>
            <li>Great shaving soap only use Taylor with my trac 2 for a inexpensive clean no skin irritation shave and only purchase here on amazon :)</li>
            <li>It features a rich and full-bodied lather that has an exceptional scent.  </li>
            <li>The lavender is very relaxing and makes a fine lather using my Omega badger brush.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street manufactures an outstanding shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>My skin was irritated the first couple times-</li>
            <li>Just ask my wife ;)</li>
            <li>I recommend heating up the shave bowl prior to using this or any soap as it really helps the lather work into the skin better.</li>
            <li>Most of you wet shavers know that it&#x27;s fun to mix it up now and again</li>
            <li>It compresses back into hard soap remarkably well!</li>
            <li>While the cheaper guys like William&#x27;s and Col. Conk do the job just fine, this soap really feels like a cut above both in terms of aroma and performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Became fascinated with shaving using a brush/soap after receiving barber shop straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>It was larger than my bowl, but I managed to trim and get it to fit.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this brand</li>
            <li>It does not give a good lather, does not smell very much like lavender and is very harsh on my skin (sensitive).  </li>
            <li>The lather was not as thick as I prefer and without a good pre-shave oil, there wasn&#x27;t much to the lubricating properties of this soap.</li>
            <li>I got so fed up with my useless electric razor, I started researching articles on how to achieve the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but everything else sucks.</li>
            <li>a new mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a shaving pro, I&#x27;ve only started with wet shaving, but this soap is way better than the sample soap my brush came with.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li>It may seem pricey at first, but remember, that this one soap will last you anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on how often you shave.  </li>
            <li>Old School Shaving is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I have used shaving soaps in the past and I never gotten a better shave.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip: If it doesn&#x27;t fit your bowl, shave it with a grater and press it down.</li>
            <li>vs. I make for $1.50) with sweet walnut oil and different essential oils.  </li>
            <li>While there might be a little bit of truth to that I can say that besides smelling fantastic this stuff produces a luscious creamy lather that doesn&#x27;t quit.</li>
            <li>I guess it is important to note that, I have been using this with a pre-shave oil as well and the results are near barber shop shave with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a cake of this soap nearly six months ago</li>
            <li>heartily recommend any of Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li>I used a potato peeler to whittle away the outside, then dropped the shavings in my cup and placed the newly shaped cake into my mug.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than other soaps, but lasts much longer and is higher quality soap.  </li>
            <li>A cake this size can easily last six months hence a major bargain.</li>
            <li>I think of this as a little higher end on the soap spectrum but it is well prices compared to some of the others.</li>
            <li>I figured the price difference was due to the fact that you were buying from high end</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent of this one quite as much as the Art of Shaving one I previously had, but this one lasts longer.</li>

            <li> fairly long lasting, depending on how aggressively you lather for a shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Concerned with how long it lasts, will have to check back on that.</li>
            <li> I used to believe that there was no functional difference between cheap shave soap and expensive shave soap.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t last as long as others stated, but this could be due to my shaving habits...  </li>
            <li> Unlike other soaps, like Colonel Conk, which only lasted two or three months and dries my skin out terribly, this soap leaves my skin soft and smelling good hours after my shave is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap was a big let down.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t stay wet for a very long time</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this soap for any serious shaver&#x27;s den.</li>
            <li> but then I hadn&#x27;t \\&quot;wet shaved\\&quot; in years and my skin just was not used to it.</li>
            <li> It gets a lot of use, and I would guess it still has quite a few months left.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using it, and I shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I&#x27;m a Proraso green cream man, that&#x27;s what I use for my everyday shaves, but about once a week</li>
            <li> This is my everyday soap for now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be forewarned; this cake may not fit into your cup.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a slow shaver</li>
            <li> Nothing realy wrong with this soap, I just have other preferences.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s all just soap</li>
            <li> It is crazy how long it has lasted!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> But the lather is not great.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Became fascinated with shaving using a brush/soap after receiving barber shop straight razor shave.  Picked up this soap after reading up on many internet sites.  Produces a great nice smelling lather.  Mine didn&#x27;t last as long as others stated, but this could be due to my shaving habits...  I chose lavender as it is touted as a good scent to use for those with sensitive skin like myself.  Interestingly, I have also tried lavender soap from The Art of Shaving (AOS), which resulted in significant irritation than the Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) soap and is more than twice the price.  I guess it is important to note that, I have been using this with a pre-shave oil as well and the results are near barber shop shave with little or no irritation.  I would recommend this soap over the AOS based not only on price but also product performance.  I recommend heating up the shave bowl prior to using this or any soap as it really helps the lather work into the skin better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Art of Shaving Soap and was rather pretty happy with it until found a better soap in OLD bond;  the lavender Taylor of Old Bond Shaving soap is the best I have found;  I do use preshave oil that I make myself since they cost 7-10 times as much in stores ($20+  vs. I make for $1.50) with sweet walnut oil and different essential oils.  Anyways, I tried several different Proraso creams and soaps also but NOPE !   this item here is hands down the best; even if it is perhaps not much smoother than the Art of Shaving Soap BUT is sure looks (maintains purple color) and smells much stronger of lavender and better &#x3D; more luxurious.</li>

            <li> Taylor of Bond Street has made a truly quality shave soap here.  A nice shave has a way to start the day off right, and Taylor&#x27;s lavender soap does just that.  Just a little water and a warm-soaked shave brush will create an awesome lather to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nothing realy wrong with this soap, I just have other preferences.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Proraso for several years and decided to give this a try.  The smell was great, however, for me it did not give nearly as smooth a shave as the Proraso.</li>
            <li> I went from the Colonel Conk to Taylor and man it&#x27;s a difference! This really gets into the skin good. Maybe I&#x27;m just a slow shaver but I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t stay wet for a very long time so I have to lather one twice per pass, while the conk can do a full pass without reapplication.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, and has a manly scent.  It may seem pricey at first, but remember, that this one soap will last you anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on how often you shave.  That is a lot of savings, plus is leaves your skinning feeling a lot cleaner that that gooey gel stuff!  Old School Shaving is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I used to believe that there was no functional difference between cheap shave soap and expensive shave soap. I mean, it&#x27;s all just soap right? I figured the price difference was due to the fact that you were buying from high end European perfumers and had to pay for their fragrances. While there might be a little bit of truth to that I can say that besides smelling fantastic this stuff produces a luscious creamy lather that doesn&#x27;t quit. It lubes the razor like a champ and leaves your skin moisturized and feeling great. While the cheaper guys like William&#x27;s and Col. Conk do the job just fine, this soap really feels like a cut above both in terms of aroma and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;m a Proraso green cream man, that&#x27;s what I use for my everyday shaves, but about once a week or so I like to pull this stuff out like a bottle of fine brandy and treat myself to something nice. And boy is it nice! Most of you wet shavers know that it&#x27;s fun to mix it up now and again and I would highly recommend this soap for any serious shaver&#x27;s den.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t want to try this but he used it and told me he likes it better than everything else he  has tried.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday soap for now. Nice lather, wonderful smell. Wish the original sale promotion on the Amazon site was much more explanatory as to what type and size of soap bowl or mug that this would fit. Would like an answer to this inquiry.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap only use Taylor with my trac 2 for a inexpensive clean no skin irritation shave and only purchase here on amazon :)</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, not too strong. But the lather is not great. This soap also leaves a film on everything. The film and lather suck. Seriously. The scent is amazing, but everything else sucks. Look elsewhere. I&#x27;ve had cheap soaps give me a better lather.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street manufactures an outstanding shaving soap.  I purchased a cake of this soap nearly six months ago and I&#x27;m still using it, and I shave every other day.  It features a rich and full-bodied lather that has an exceptional scent.  Best of all, it&#x27;s mild on my skin.  Unlike other soaps, like Colonel Conk, which only lasted two or three months and dries my skin out terribly, this soap leaves my skin soft and smelling good hours after my shave is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned; this cake may not fit into your cup.  The cake is larger than Colonel Conk, which measured 2-1/2&amp;#34; and fit perfectly in my shaving mug.  I used a potato peeler to whittle away the outside, then dropped the shavings in my cup and placed the newly shaped cake into my mug.  It worked fine, but it was a bit of work.  For the next cake, I&#x27;m thinking of getting a properly sized hole saw from the hardware store to speed up the process, or perhaps it&#x27;s cheaper to just buy a new mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend any of Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s soaps.  They have a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s more expensive than other soaps, but lasts much longer and is higher quality soap.  I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving! :-)</li>
            <li> Husband loves this and he smells wonderful when he uses it.  Will order it again when he runs out of it.</li>
            <li> This soap was a big let down.  It does not give a good lather, does not smell very much like lavender and is very harsh on my skin (sensitive).  It is the color purple though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of shaving soaps.  Taylor of OB is my favorite.  It has a nice clean scent, lathers into a rich lather and provides good protection for the skin.  I just wish they made more of their scents in soap versus cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a fantastic close shave I get using it. I have used shaving soaps in the past and I never gotten a better shave. In addition it is very economical.</li>
            <li> By far this is the best shave soap out there, believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.  A cake this size can easily last six months hence a major bargain.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite shaving soap. The lavender is very relaxing and makes a fine lather using my Omega badger brush.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaving soap! I&#x27;m not a shaving pro, I&#x27;ve only started with wet shaving, but this soap is way better than the sample soap my brush came with. Here&#x27;s a tip: If it doesn&#x27;t fit your bowl, shave it with a grater and press it down. It compresses back into hard soap remarkably well!</li>
            <li> It came in a nice package. Makes a good lather. It was larger than my bowl, but I managed to trim and get it to fit. I really like the scent, more importantly, the wife does too.</li>
            <li> The lather is so rich the blade glides effortlessly over my face.  This is much better than a glycerine based soap.</li>
            <li> replaces Art of Shaving soap perfectly, good quality and soothing light lavender scent.  fairly long lasting, depending on how aggressively you lather for a shave.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this brand but I was disappointed.  The lather was not as thick as I prefer and without a good pre-shave oil, there wasn&#x27;t much to the lubricating properties of this soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers nice, smells great, and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned with how long it lasts, will have to check back on that.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year and a half ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. I shave my head too, and only leave my goatee unshaved.  It gets a lot of use, and I would guess it still has quite a few months left.  I don&#x27;t like the scent of this one quite as much as the Art of Shaving one I previously had, but this one lasts longer. The scent is pretty good too, I just liked the other one better.  Update:  After over 2.5 years of using this twice a week, I haven&#x27;t finished it yet.  It is crazy how long it has lasted!</li>
            <li> Great soap. I love ToBS. Lathers well and has a nice subtle smell to it. I think of this as a little higher end on the soap spectrum but it is well prices compared to some of the others. I will continue using there products.</li>
            <li> Love this shaving soap. Great scent, good foam, and lasts for a long time.</li>
