            <li>Thanks for the great service!</li>

            <li>I find the application very easy.  </li>
            <li>so I was very happy when Maybelline developed this product!</li>
            <li>I waited to review to make sure I liked it  </li>
            <li>I was pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I used to use it first and then use Great lash over top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most mascaras but find Lash Discovery very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Many others I&#x27;ve tried have outperformed it.</li>
            <li>I have this mascara more than 10</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>This tiny wand is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>I love that the applicator is skinny.</li>
            <li>Over the years many people have commented on my eyelashes</li>
            <li>Love the mini brush.</li>
            <li>does a great job and really makes my eyelashes stand out..</li>
            <li>It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly.  </li>
            <li>but I do love the mascara and the wand</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love this &amp;#34;Mimi-Brush&amp;#34; applicator.  </li>
            <li>Love the brush and how it applies.</li>
            <li>This mascara was ok.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara because my lashes are thinning.  </li>
            <li>Literally my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than overpriced department store mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best tool for applying mascara to the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>then brush Benefit&#x27;s Rollergirl mascara over it for the best volume, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It comes off more easily with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to remove at night with warm water and a mild eye make-up remover.  </li>
            <li>This brush allows a more precise application.</li>
            <li>The first time was not through Amazon and I was very pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>Great for tight lining but not so good for applying to remaining lashes.</li>
            <li>It also removed easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Washes off easy with soap and water as well.  </li>
            <li>With the mini brush it&#x27;s quite easy to get each and every one of the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply</li>
            <li>Is not as good as some of the more expensive mascaras that I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job and is an excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li>I still use my favorite mascara for the rest of my lashes, but this is fantistic for getting full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous forever, which I still like, but this is a really good new find for me.</li>
            <li>This is great as it has a really small brush so you do not smudge it and get it every where except your eye lashes and good price.</li>
            <li>been using this product for awhile, it goes on easy and light, no clumping, flaking or globbiing.</li>
            <li>Quick service!</li>
            <li>It does the job plus it leaves my lashes look natural and it&#x27;s very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap too.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the brownish color was still available.</li>
            <li>Great mascara when you don&#x27;t want to look like you are obviously wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>It is great because it separates lashes well, looks more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other products (sometimes, people can&#x27;t tell I am wearing it...</li>
            <li>It arrived on time in its original container.  </li>
            <li>But in general it is good.</li>
            <li>The small wand is perfect for bottom lashes, no matter what the length.</li>
            <li>The product is great when not old.  </li>
            <li>Consistent coverage and color for many years-</li>
            <li>Mostly because of the brush--it finds all those tiny lashes and separates nicely.</li>
            <li>This holds true for all Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li>It does not clump and is a good mascara if you want to have defined individual lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush is very small, so it&#x27;s perfect for the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li>I have very small lashes, so this is perfect to get each one of them!</li>
            <li>this is my favorite mascara, no clumping no irritation long lasting, clean off easily ! ! !</li>
            <li>I now own both the regular and waterproof.</li>
            <li>Goes quicker but its worth it for problem lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is the best for those of us with less than full eyelashes and mixed lenghts.</li>
            <li>I have used this mascara for a long time and hope to have it available for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Very easy to get each and every lash (lower and upper).  </li>
            <li>Good product, just not right for me.</li>
            <li>great small brush for getting every lash.&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
            <li>All time fave, the small brush allows for great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine lashes and the brush is tiny, so it did nothing to help give me any volume.</li>
            <li>so I am trying a coat of those on top of this in order to give a little more.</li>
            <li>In terms of application, it has a straight applicator and requires two coats with solid technique for a nice look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see such good reviews.</li>
            <li>in any event, I do very much like this Lash Discovery.</li>
            <li>For anyone that has heard of It Cosmetics Tightline, try this first.</li>
            <li>I feel like it actually gives me more control over how they go on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried this \\&quot;style\\&quot; in the Maybelline line.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the tiny wand.</li>
            <li>it really does work for the lower eye lashes!</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the tiny brush that delivers the mascara to my lashes...</li>
            <li>Great concept, but very small and flimsy brush.</li>
            <li>I also like the narrow brush, more precise in application.</li>
            <li>I deal with the minor itching for the love of the product.</li>
            <li>Or was that full n&#x27; soft?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, if not, better dupe for clinique&#x27;s bottom lash mascara.</li>
            <li>And somehow received this when I was suppose to get maybeline full and soft.</li>
            <li>The best out there is Maybelline New York Illegal Length Fiber Extensions</li>
            <li>and it really does irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really washable.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The vendor delivered on time at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I do, however, like it for my lower lashes, as I don&#x27;t like as much coverage on them.</li>
            <li>and it takes so much time to finish an eyelash.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes, this isn&#x27;t really it.  </li>
            <li>Washable Mascara - they really give you extension and no clumps.  </li>
            <li>This tiny brush is fantastic for reaching the lower lashes, and it stays put throughout the day without flaking.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it really is washable.  </li>
            <li>It really doesnt do anything to them</li>
            <li>But, moving along, I really like this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also found it to be economical, not only because it is cheap, but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes (both bottom and both top) with just one application (no double dipping</li>
            <li>The only other mascara I have found as good is Lancôme, but</li>
            <li>The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it.  </li>
            <li>actually works great being so small.</li>
            <li>so its nice that it has a small brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and don&#x27;t know how I would live without it!</li>
            <li>I think this is because Dena Alcohol is one of the main ingredients listed in it formula</li>
            <li>It use this as a first coat to get all the small lashes and then with my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Its the same length as most but has very short bristles.</li>
            <li>if you don;t have a steady hand you&#x27;re gonna get mascara on in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the narrow brush, which deposits lots of mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it for work and everyday look.</li>
            <li>¦s mascara is $20+ for a new tube.</li>
            <li>hope that they would make an alcohol free eye products, because the same irritation I feel it whenver I put the Master Drama eyeline on my inner rim.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It makes getting all the lashes easy without a mess.</li>
            <li>The small brush make sit easy to apply product to the corners of lashes or very close to the lashline for a tightline look.</li>
            <li>On those days, if come off surprisingly easily with a little moisturizer on the end of a q-tip.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and goes on a little or alot depending on your taste.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; mascara because it provides a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>I like a mascara that makes my eyes come alive, but also leaves my lashes looking like hair, soft and natural.</li>
            <li>It never clumps until it&#x27;s old and time to throw out.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, and will definitely be buying it again.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed to be &#x27;old&#x27; - could not use it - it was semi-dried up.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised to find this mascara did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the brush, it is spaced too far apart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not found any mascara so far that does not clump or stick lashes together at some point.</li>
            <li>If you really want to make your eyes pop, you have to use mascara on the inner, and outer eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I am infact sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I tried using it on my upper lashes, but it didnt&#x27; do much for them.  </li>
            <li>And as far as the product states, it doesn&#x27;t clump or glob (yet, we&#x27;ll see in a couple of months)</li>
            <li>The wand is thin so that the mascara applies nicely without clumping.</li>
            <li>I like the small applicator wand and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t that much product, though, so a tube doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Since the wand is so small, it picks up just enough mascara to coat my lashes both top and bottom and it lasts all day even when my eyes get watery.</li>
            <li>The brush is only good if you have tiny lashes - the bristles were so short and the mascara so thick that there was no way</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favourite mascaras so far.</li>
            <li>have very short Asian lashes that are almost non-existent and these really lengthened them by almost double!</li>
            <li>This is probably the most frustrating mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>When I pulled the wand out the first time, I was totally surprised how little the end/bristles were!  </li>
            <li>It gets the lashes other brushes wont reach and it is gentle on my lashes, not cakey.</li>
            <li>But, when I want something more dramatic, I use another mascara.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at first by the small wand</li>
            <li>Plus, since I like to get the mascara right down to the very roots of my eyelashes, the narrow brush doesn&#x27;t smudge it all over my eyelids in the process.</li>
            <li>The first few times I ended up with mascara all over my lids.</li>
            <li>The wand is very small and thin which takes a little getting used to but the results are rather impressive.</li>
            <li>Also, the thin brush makes it easy to apply to the bottom lashes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I was very happy when Maybelline developed this product!</li>
            <li> I waited to review to make sure I liked it  </li>
            <li> I was pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I used to use it first and then use Great lash over top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most mascaras but find Lash Discovery very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Many others I&#x27;ve tried have outperformed it.</li>
            <li> I have this mascara more than 10</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> This tiny wand is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> I love that the applicator is skinny.</li>
            <li> Over the years many people have commented on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Love the mini brush.</li>
            <li> does a great job and really makes my eyelashes stand out..</li>
            <li> It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly.  </li>
            <li> but I do love the mascara and the wand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;Mimi-Brush&amp;#34; applicator.  </li>
            <li> Love the brush and how it applies.</li>
            <li> This mascara was ok.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara because my lashes are thinning.  </li>
            <li> Literally my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than overpriced department store mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best tool for applying mascara to the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> then brush Benefit&#x27;s Rollergirl mascara over it for the best volume, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes off more easily with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to remove at night with warm water and a mild eye make-up remover.  </li>
            <li> This brush allows a more precise application.</li>
            <li> The first time was not through Amazon and I was very pleased with product.  </li>
            <li> Great for tight lining but not so good for applying to remaining lashes.</li>
            <li> It also removed easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Washes off easy with soap and water as well.  </li>
            <li> With the mini brush it&#x27;s quite easy to get each and every one of the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply</li>
            <li> Is not as good as some of the more expensive mascaras that I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job and is an excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I still use my favorite mascara for the rest of my lashes, but this is fantistic for getting full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous forever, which I still like, but this is a really good new find for me.</li>
            <li> This is great as it has a really small brush so you do not smudge it and get it every where except your eye lashes and good price.</li>
            <li> been using this product for awhile, it goes on easy and light, no clumping, flaking or globbiing.</li>
            <li> Quick service!</li>
            <li> It does the job plus it leaves my lashes look natural and it&#x27;s very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap too.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the brownish color was still available.</li>
            <li> Great mascara when you don&#x27;t want to look like you are obviously wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> It is great because it separates lashes well, looks more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other products (sometimes, people can&#x27;t tell I am wearing it...</li>
            <li> It arrived on time in its original container.  </li>
            <li> But in general it is good.</li>
            <li> The small wand is perfect for bottom lashes, no matter what the length.</li>
            <li> The product is great when not old.  </li>
            <li> Consistent coverage and color for many years-</li>
            <li> Mostly because of the brush--it finds all those tiny lashes and separates nicely.</li>
            <li> This holds true for all Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> It does not clump and is a good mascara if you want to have defined individual lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush is very small, so it&#x27;s perfect for the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li> I have very small lashes, so this is perfect to get each one of them!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara, no clumping no irritation long lasting, clean off easily ! ! !</li>
            <li> I now own both the regular and waterproof.</li>
            <li> Goes quicker but its worth it for problem lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best for those of us with less than full eyelashes and mixed lenghts.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for a long time and hope to have it available for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Very easy to get each and every lash (lower and upper).  </li>
            <li> Good product, just not right for me.</li>
            <li> great small brush for getting every lash.&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
            <li> All time fave, the small brush allows for great coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine lashes and the brush is tiny, so it did nothing to help give me any volume.</li>
            <li> so I am trying a coat of those on top of this in order to give a little more.</li>
            <li> In terms of application, it has a straight applicator and requires two coats with solid technique for a nice look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see such good reviews.</li>
            <li> in any event, I do very much like this Lash Discovery.</li>
            <li> For anyone that has heard of It Cosmetics Tightline, try this first.</li>
            <li> I feel like it actually gives me more control over how they go on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried this \\&quot;style\\&quot; in the Maybelline line.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the tiny wand.</li>
            <li> it really does work for the lower eye lashes!</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the tiny brush that delivers the mascara to my lashes...</li>
            <li> Great concept, but very small and flimsy brush.</li>
            <li> I also like the narrow brush, more precise in application.</li>
            <li> I deal with the minor itching for the love of the product.</li>
            <li> Or was that full n&#x27; soft?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, if not, better dupe for clinique&#x27;s bottom lash mascara.</li>
            <li> And somehow received this when I was suppose to get maybeline full and soft.</li>
            <li> The best out there is Maybelline New York Illegal Length Fiber Extensions</li>
            <li> and it really does irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really washable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The vendor delivered on time at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I do, however, like it for my lower lashes, as I don&#x27;t like as much coverage on them.</li>
            <li> and it takes so much time to finish an eyelash.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes, this isn&#x27;t really it.  </li>
            <li> Washable Mascara - they really give you extension and no clumps.  </li>
            <li> This tiny brush is fantastic for reaching the lower lashes, and it stays put throughout the day without flaking.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it really is washable.  </li>
            <li> It really doesnt do anything to them</li>
            <li> But, moving along, I really like this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also found it to be economical, not only because it is cheap, but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes (both bottom and both top) with just one application (no double dipping</li>
            <li> The only other mascara I have found as good is Lancôme, but</li>
            <li> The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it.  </li>
            <li> actually works great being so small.</li>
            <li> so its nice that it has a small brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and don&#x27;t know how I would live without it!</li>
            <li> I think this is because Dena Alcohol is one of the main ingredients listed in it formula</li>
            <li> It use this as a first coat to get all the small lashes and then with my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Its the same length as most but has very short bristles.</li>
            <li> if you don;t have a steady hand you&#x27;re gonna get mascara on in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the narrow brush, which deposits lots of mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it for work and everyday look.</li>
            <li> ¦s mascara is $20+ for a new tube.</li>
            <li> hope that they would make an alcohol free eye products, because the same irritation I feel it whenver I put the Master Drama eyeline on my inner rim.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It makes getting all the lashes easy without a mess.</li>
            <li> The small brush make sit easy to apply product to the corners of lashes or very close to the lashline for a tightline look.</li>
            <li> On those days, if come off surprisingly easily with a little moisturizer on the end of a q-tip.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and goes on a little or alot depending on your taste.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; mascara because it provides a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> I like a mascara that makes my eyes come alive, but also leaves my lashes looking like hair, soft and natural.</li>
            <li> It never clumps until it&#x27;s old and time to throw out.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, and will definitely be buying it again.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed to be &#x27;old&#x27; - could not use it - it was semi-dried up.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised to find this mascara did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush, it is spaced too far apart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found any mascara so far that does not clump or stick lashes together at some point.</li>
            <li> If you really want to make your eyes pop, you have to use mascara on the inner, and outer eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I am infact sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on my upper lashes, but it didnt&#x27; do much for them.  </li>
            <li> And as far as the product states, it doesn&#x27;t clump or glob (yet, we&#x27;ll see in a couple of months)</li>
            <li> The wand is thin so that the mascara applies nicely without clumping.</li>
            <li> I like the small applicator wand and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t that much product, though, so a tube doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Since the wand is so small, it picks up just enough mascara to coat my lashes both top and bottom and it lasts all day even when my eyes get watery.</li>
            <li> The brush is only good if you have tiny lashes - the bristles were so short and the mascara so thick that there was no way</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favourite mascaras so far.</li>
            <li> have very short Asian lashes that are almost non-existent and these really lengthened them by almost double!</li>
            <li> This is probably the most frustrating mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> When I pulled the wand out the first time, I was totally surprised how little the end/bristles were!  </li>
            <li> It gets the lashes other brushes wont reach and it is gentle on my lashes, not cakey.</li>
            <li> But, when I want something more dramatic, I use another mascara.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at first by the small wand</li>
            <li> Plus, since I like to get the mascara right down to the very roots of my eyelashes, the narrow brush doesn&#x27;t smudge it all over my eyelids in the process.</li>
            <li> The first few times I ended up with mascara all over my lids.</li>
            <li> The wand is very small and thin which takes a little getting used to but the results are rather impressive.</li>
            <li> Also, the thin brush makes it easy to apply to the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> It occurred to me that the very minor difference in performance is likely not worth paying 3x&#x27;s as much, so this is on subscribe and save every 3 months</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, the brush is very thin so it doesn’t have a lot of mascara to lump up.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and dislike using make-up remover due to oily residue</li>
            <li> So I spent a long time looking for a mascara with the tiniest wand possible and one that doesn&#x27;t smudge and sting my extremely sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> The brush is very small, so it is useful for end of my eyelash, but</li>
            <li> The wind is small, so I can really get to individual lashes without getting it all smeared...and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  </li>
            <li> Small applicator gives you total control and allows you to get really close to the lash line, extend and define the lashes.</li>
            <li> I like the small brush because it can catch all the small lashes, but I&#x27;ll be switching back to the good &#x27;ole pink and green Maybelline.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a few months now as it is time to change mascara&#x27;s; I will not order this particular style again.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it brushes on, very little clumping.</li>
            <li> Not clumpy, never thick and the small brush lets me grab even the tiny lashes on the inner edge of my eyes without smearing.</li>
            <li> I normally apply it, wait a few minutes and</li>
            <li> I think that it finds every single little invisible lash I have without leaving globs or making one huge thick eyelash out of three tiny ones.</li>
            <li> It has a very small brush which is just fantastic to get every little lash, even in the corners, without having mascara all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes extremely long, but I have to spend 5 minutes to do so.</li>
            <li> But I wish the wand wasn&#x27;t so long and flexible.  </li>
            <li> It takes too long to apply.</li>
            <li> applies evenly, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are long, thick but unfortunately straight ¼</li>
            <li> It provides a nice subtle lenghening and defines and darkens your lashes without being too dramatic.</li>
            <li> It really helps define my eyelashes and distributes the product well due to the small brush.</li>
            <li> I try other brands now and then but always come back to Maybelline.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be happier in the long run with this one!</li>
            <li> have several other mascaras I&#x27;ve been trying</li>
            <li> I find this mascara to be non-irritating and it does not flake or dry out my lashes.</li>
            <li> On the flip side,  If you like thin applicators, this is probably exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> The only negative is I really dislike the tiny, hard brush and prefer Estee&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> This is a basic well performing black mascara.</li>
            <li> The fineness of the brush makes it possible to catch the little lashes.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara for the hard to reach places like the back of my upper lashes and the corners of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is bad about this product is that it takes awhile to adjust to it being sooo light, the wand that is.</li>
            <li> If I apply it carefully it doesn&#x27;t clump; it never burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use it everyday (</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait for it to be empty.</li>
            <li> but for this price I can definitely get past that.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that I think this is going to run soon out due to the small size of the packaging.</li>
            <li> With every other brand, I usually scrape the extra mascara off the sides of the wand before applying so that i don&#x27;t have globs to contend with afterward.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is like any other mascara to me.</li>
            <li> but my mom now uses it for her top and bottom lashes, she says it gives her the definition she is looking for on an everyday look without clumps and that bad stuff</li>
            <li> you like the thick, spiky, super dramatic lashes</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought that I could deal with a &amp;#34;mini brush&amp;#34; - if I only I knew just how little it was!!</li>
            <li> I am clumsy when it comes to applying mascara - I sweat, I hold my breath, yet I always manage to put mascara on my cornea - with regular mascara, that is.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Have to use several coats and the wand is very small.</li>
            <li> I received black, which does work for now.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my mom because she&#x27;s not into super crazy dramatic looks and isn&#x27;t expert at applying makeup</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will try something else or try a new product, but nothing comes close to Illegal Length in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, at the end of the day, I&#x27;ll see little flakes of mascara on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> That is very hard to do with a regular mascara wand.  </li>
            <li> I have had so much trouble with mascara flaking off during the day.</li>
            <li> found some to be dried out</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday), but whenever I do during the daytime, this is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> Not one to cause a stink over a few bucks, and call and complain.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, very expensive ones and less expensive ones, famous brands and ones you never heard of.</li>
            <li> Thin little brush, takes a few coats to do anything and by that time it&#x27;s a little clumpy with no extension.  </li>
            <li> It tends to leave smudges after a shower unless I make it a point to wash over my eyelids with cleanser, which I usually forget to do.</li>
            <li> sometime I think it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> The brush itself is really small</li>
            <li> If the brush is too big, it is difficult to put it on without getting mascara under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I like the small brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand of mascara because it&#x27;s one of the very few that once I curl my eyelashes and apply the mascara, they remain curled.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very small and narrow</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I saw the wand as it is thin and small---</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to control.</li>
            <li> so they are hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> this sucks for your lower lashes.</li>
            <li> If you like it thick you can just keep applying it.</li>
            <li> So thick that the clumps had clumps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is with very small size brush</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month by now, I still can&#x27;t get used to how thin it is.</li>
            <li> This product works as a thin covering for the lashes you have.</li>
            <li> I have never had/used a mascara with this thin of an applicator.</li>
            <li> Not everyone cares for the thin brush</li>
            <li> Not great comments on them.</li>
            <li> , the mascara is clumpy, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off leaving ugly dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> But it is difficult to remove, even with makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> that TOO expensive...</li>
            <li> The small brush allows you to get close to your lash base so the color starts there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also slides down my face as the day wears on and looks awful by day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> This time through Amazon totally disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> and there are a few that aren&#x27;t totally terrible</li>
            <li> you can use this alone or as a base (under another that creates volume) for when you go out and want the dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive brands...</li>
            <li> I ordered this very skeptical.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too bad, but does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think using the Lash Discovery from the base to the ends and then using one with a thicker brush just on the ends might work out</li>
            <li> $30 stuff is outrageous to me</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This, and &amp;quot;Stiletto&amp;quot; and the only mascaras that work for my very short, blonde eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I think this is because Dena Alcohol is one of the main ingredients listed in it formula and it really does irritates my eyes. hope that they would make an alcohol free eye products, because the same irritation I feel it whenver I put the Master Drama eyeline on my inner rim.</li>
            <li> I am clumsy when it comes to applying mascara - I sweat, I hold my breath, yet I always manage to put mascara on my cornea - with regular mascara, that is. So I spent a long time looking for a mascara with the tiniest wand possible and one that doesn&#x27;t smudge and sting my extremely sensitive eyes. I am glad that I found the perfect one for my with this Maybelline Lash Discovery Mascara! Since the wand is so small, it picks up just enough mascara to coat my lashes both top and bottom and it lasts all day even when my eyes get watery. I&#x27;ll never look at another mascara again!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time in its original container.  I&#x27;ve used this kind of mascara before, and it seemed to be just as good as buying it in a store!</li>
            <li> I waited to review to make sure I liked it  This is a good mascara.  The wand is thin so that the mascara applies nicely without clumping.</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect for daytime. It never clumps until it&#x27;s old and time to throw out. I like that it&#x27;s really washable.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it stays on, and I love the microbrush!  But it is difficult to remove, even with makeup remover.  I always had some still on the next day, though I tried to remove it the night before.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on customer reviews, knowing the wand is a skinny one. Skinny sands don&#x27;t bother me, but this one binds my lashes together, giving me six or seven lash-clumps, rather than separating my lashes and fanning them out. It is just sub-par in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also slides down my face as the day wears on and looks awful by day&#x27;s end. Not the kind of performance I expect in a mascara. Many others I&#x27;ve tried have outperformed it.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long, thick but unfortunately straight ¼ I only use the mascara to highlight them and keep them curled after using the curler on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Estee Lauder&amp;iexcl;¦s product for but a friend insisted this is just as good. Estee&amp;iexcl;¦s mascara is $20+ for a new tube. I figured I have only $5 to lose if this works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;iexcl;¦m impressed. I really like this product. I now own both the regular and waterproof. No clumping or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe I&amp;iexcl;¦ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me. The only negative is I really dislike the tiny, hard brush and prefer Estee&amp;iexcl;¦s brush but for this price I can definitely get past that.</li>
            <li> This product works as a thin covering for the lashes you have. There&#x27;s no extending or lengthening with this mascara. I like the small brush because it can catch all the small lashes, but I&#x27;ll be switching back to the good &#x27;ole pink and green Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Quick service! This mascara came out in the 90s and I can still remember the commercials with Sarah Michelle Gellar. Or was that full n&#x27; soft? Any who... this product is great. It gets the lashes other brushes wont reach and it is gentle on my lashes, not cakey.</li>
            <li> For anyone that has heard of It Cosmetics Tightline, try this first. It use this as a first coat to get all the small lashes and then with my favorite mascara. Ir makes SUCH a difference.</li>
            <li> Great concept, but very small and flimsy brush. The vendor delivered on time at a reasonable price. After using the product for a few months now as it is time to change mascara&#x27;s; I will not order this particular style again.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my lashes. Have to use several coats and the wand is very small. I like &amp;#34;doll eyes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a basic well performing black mascara. For the price it cannot be beat. It is not waterproof, so is not for the overly emotional. It tends to leave smudges after a shower unless I make it a point to wash over my eyelids with cleanser, which I usually forget to do. On those days, if come off surprisingly easily with a little moisturizer on the end of a q-tip. In terms of application, it has a straight applicator and requires two coats with solid technique for a nice look. Is not as good as some of the more expensive mascaras that I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job and is an excellent value for the price. It occurred to me that the very minor difference in performance is likely not worth paying 3x&#x27;s as much, so this is on subscribe and save every 3 months and I don&#x27;t even have to think about remembering to change out my mascara properly!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favourite mascaras so far. The wand is very small and thin which takes a little getting used to but the results are rather impressive.</li>
            <li> When I pulled the wand out the first time, I was totally surprised how little the end/bristles were!  But it totally works!  I feel like it actually gives me more control over how they go on my lashes.  I really like this mascara, and will definitely be buying it again.  I have used L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous forever, which I still like, but this is a really good new find for me.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be &#x27;old&#x27; - could not use it - it was semi-dried up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the excellent reviews it received. When I tried it, it did nothing for me. I have very fine lashes and the brush is tiny, so it did nothing to help give me any volume. I do, however, like it for my lower lashes, as I don&#x27;t like as much coverage on them. Good product, just not right for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is very small, so it is useful for end of my eyelash, but sometime I think it&#x27;s too small and it takes so much time to finish an eyelash. But in general it is good.</li>
            <li> I have this mascara more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is with very small size brush so I use it for my under eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep buying this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara after reading all the good reviews. So I was surprised to find this mascara did not work for me at all. If you are someone who needs any volume or length this mascara probably will not work for you. Yes, it does separate lashes well and is awesome at getting the lower lashes but that is about it....</li>
            <li> I have never had/used a mascara with this thin of an applicator. Though I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month by now, I still can&#x27;t get used to how thin it is. On the flip side,  If you like thin applicators, this is probably exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> I am throwing this away. I don&#x27;t like the brush, it is spaced too far apart, the mascara is clumpy, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off leaving ugly dark circles under your eyes. Ick. I&#x27;m surprised to see such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It really helps define my eyelashes and distributes the product well due to the small brush. It also removed easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried this \\&quot;style\\&quot; in the Maybelline line.  I&#x27;ve found over the years that Maybelline is really the best for the price.  I&#x27;ve tried very expensive brands...$30 stuff is outrageous to me but I tried it.  Was not worth the money.  I try other brands now and then but always come back to Maybelline. I really like the way it brushes on, very little clumping. I&#x27;ve not found any mascara so far that does not clump or stick lashes together at some point. I also like the narrow brush, more precise in application.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes extremely long, but I have to spend 5 minutes to do so. Layers by layers by layers....</li>
            <li> I will admit I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying a &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; mascara... But once I started using it I was pretty happy. I find it easier to use than the standard size handle. Only downside is that I think this is going to run soon out due to the small size of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I have been using it for years. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if it were discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love the brush. Defines and applies a good amount of mascara without clumps.  But I wish the wand wasn&#x27;t so long and flexible.  It&#x27;s hard to control. I want the brush to push on the eyelashes instead of the eyelashes making the wand bend.  It takes too long to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for a long time and hope to have it available for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras, but always come back to this one. I love the narrow brush, which deposits lots of mascara. Plus, since I like to get the mascara right down to the very roots of my eyelashes, the narrow brush doesn&#x27;t smudge it all over my eyelids in the process.</li>
            <li> If you really want to make your eyes pop, you have to use mascara on the inner, and outer eyelashes.  That is very hard to do with a regular mascara wand.  This tiny wand is perfect for that.  It&#x27;s also great for getting those lower eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and don&#x27;t know how I would live without it!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, very expensive ones and less expensive ones, famous brands and ones you never heard of. I keep coming back to this one. I love that the applicator is skinny. No point wasting mascara by filling up a big brush every time. This brush allows a more precise application. If you like it thick you can just keep applying it. You control the look you want. The small brush allows you to get close to your lash base so the color starts there. Over the years many people have commented on my eyelashes and I owe it all to this great product. I order them in bulk so I never run out!!</li>
            <li> I used this mascara many, many years ago, and was excited to find it on here for a great price! The brush is very small, so it&#x27;s perfect for the bottom lashes. I normally apply it, wait a few minutes and then brush Benefit&#x27;s Rollergirl mascara over it for the best volume, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Only mascara I will ever use. Love the mini brush. I have had so much trouble with mascara flaking off during the day. Maybelline seems to be the best for my condition.</li>
            <li> The small wand is perfect for bottom lashes, no matter what the length.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Have been using it for years!  The wind is small, so I can really get to individual lashes without getting it all smeared...and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  The only other mascara I have found as good is Lancôme, but that TOO expensive...you&#x27;ll be happier in the long run with this one!</li>
            <li> love this use it all the time its great for the bottom lashes</li>
            <li> I was so worried when this got here. The brush itself is really small but the pay off is BIG! Gives me great not clumpy lashes. The only thing I will say is bad about this product is that it takes awhile to adjust to it being sooo light, the wand that is. The first few times I ended up with mascara all over my lids.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought that I could deal with a &amp;#34;mini brush&amp;#34; - if I only I knew just how little it was!! The brush is only good if you have tiny lashes - the bristles were so short and the mascara so thick that there was no way I could &#x27;brush&#x27; the mascara onto my lashes.  This is probably the most frustrating mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> found some to be dried out</li>
            <li> I am happy with this mascara over all. If I apply it carefully it doesn&#x27;t clump; it never burns my eyes. It does run if I sleep with it on. It comes off more easily with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Very tiny brush. Great for tight lining but not so good for applying to remaining lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best for those of us with less than full eyelashes and mixed lenghts. The fineness of the brush makes it possible to catch the little lashes. I used to use it first and then use Great lash over top. Now I am sticking with just this. Goes quicker but its worth it for problem lashes. There is an ingredient in it that is a known allergen to Maybelline. I am infact sensitive to it. I deal with the minor itching for the love of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my bottom lashes but my mom now uses it for her top and bottom lashes, she says it gives her the definition she is looking for on an everyday look without clumps and that bad stuff</li>
            <li> best mascara i have bought. does a great job and really makes my eyelashes stand out..</li>
            <li> This is my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; mascara.  I don&#x27;t actually use it everyday (because I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday), but whenever I do during the daytime, this is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mascara.  It is great because it separates lashes well, looks more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other products (sometimes, people can&#x27;t tell I am wearing it...and that is a good thing), applies evenly, and lasts a long time.  I have also found it to be economical, not only because it is cheap, but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes (both bottom and both top) with just one application (no double dipping needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple downsides:  1) It does sometimes clump in places.  The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it.  It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly.  2) Sometimes, at the end of the day, I&#x27;ll see little flakes of mascara on my cheek.  It isn&#x27;t too bad, but does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing - if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes, this isn&#x27;t really it.  This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; mascara because it provides a more natural look.  But, when I want something more dramatic, I use another mascara.</li>
            <li> this gets every lash. you can use this alone or as a base (under another that creates volume) for when you go out and want the dramatic look. been using for about 5 years now</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my mom because she&#x27;s not into super crazy dramatic looks and isn&#x27;t expert at applying makeup so its nice that it has a small brush. It provides a nice subtle lenghening and defines and darkens your lashes without being too dramatic. I&#x27;d recommend it if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d thought. It&#x27;s a bit clumpy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand of mascara because it&#x27;s one of the very few that once I curl my eyelashes and apply the mascara, they remain curled.  This holds true for all Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see without my glasses so putting on mascara is a hit or miss.  If the brush is too big, it is difficult to put it on without getting mascara under my eyes.  This brush is very small and narrow so it works perfect for my needs.  The mascara is good as well.  Stays put and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most mascaras but find Lash Discovery very comfortable to wear. Not everyone cares for the thin brush but I especially like its ability to neatly cover the itty-bitty lashes hiding in the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for lengthening lashes but does not give a lot of volume. It does not clump and is a good mascara if you want to have defined individual lashes. It&#x27;s cheap too.  I believe that people need to use more than one mascara to get the perfect look.  This should be one of them.</li>
            <li> I have problems with me hands so they are hard to apply.  Other than that they are great.  Not great comments on them.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I saw the wand as it is thin and small---but I do love the mascara and the wand actually works great being so small. Easy to use and goes on a little or alot depending on your taste.  Washes off easy with soap and water as well.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thin little brush, takes a few coats to do anything and by that time it&#x27;s a little clumpy with no extension.  The best out there is Maybelline New York Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Washable Mascara - they really give you extension and no clumps.  Once in a while I will try something else or try a new product, but nothing comes close to Illegal Length in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, the brush is very thin so it doesn’t have a lot of mascara to lump up.  Also, the thin brush makes it easy to apply to the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years. I have sensitive eyes and dislike using make-up remover due to oily residue so I was very happy when Maybelline developed this product! It doesn&#x27;t smear, run and I even use when I exercise!</li>
            <li> I love using this product! It does the job plus it leaves my lashes look natural and it&#x27;s very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes but, I&#x27;m still vain enough not to leave the house without mascara! With every other brand, I usually scrape the extra mascara off the sides of the wand before applying so that i don&#x27;t have globs to contend with afterward. I absolutely love the tiny wand. Its the same length as most but has very short bristles. I think that it finds every single little invisible lash I have without leaving globs or making one huge thick eyelash out of three tiny ones. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will add on to the thickness or length- this isn&#x27;t it. If you&#x27;re looking to highlight what you&#x27;ve got- it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the product! it really does work for the lower eye lashes! in love with it. Hope u guys like it as well</li>
            <li> Luv this product, especially this type of brush. Just wish the brownish color was still available.</li>
            <li> I like the small applicator wand and it washes off easily. Other than that it is like any other mascara to me.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes so this brush works great and stays on nice with no flacking.</li>
            <li> This tiny brush is fantastic for reaching the lower lashes, and it stays put throughout the day without flaking.  I tried using it on my upper lashes, but it didnt&#x27; do much for them.  At $5, I will definitely keep using this on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;Mimi-Brush&amp;#34; applicator.  Very easy to get each and every lash (lower and upper).  I like the fact that it really is washable.  No tugging or pulling at the eyes when trying to remove the mascara. With the mini brush it&#x27;s quite easy to get each and every one of the lower lashes.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this mascara.  The first time was not through Amazon and I was very pleased with product.  This time through Amazon totally disappointing product.  So thick that the clumps had clumps.  The product is great when not old.  Love the brush and how it applies.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now and I love it!  I have very small lashes, so this is perfect to get each one of them!</li>
            <li> this sucks for your lower lashes. It really doesnt do anything to them</li>
            <li> I was surprised at first by the small wand but it applies well and looks great. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying mascaras to see if I can find a good drugstore brand. The one I loved by Rimmel was discontinued and I haven&#x27;t found anything in their line to replace it. Still can&#x27;t figure out why they ever discontinued it ... But, moving along, I really like this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the thick, spiky, super dramatic lashes then this is not for you. I like a mascara that makes my eyes come alive, but also leaves my lashes looking like hair, soft and natural. This is the closest I have come to the Rimmel LycraLash. It has a very small brush which is just fantastic to get every little lash, even in the corners, without having mascara all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several other mascaras I&#x27;ve been trying and there are a few that aren&#x27;t totally terrible so I am trying a coat of those on top of this in order to give a little more.I think using the Lash Discovery from the base to the ends and then using one with a thicker brush just on the ends might work out pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in any event, I do very much like this Lash Discovery. It&#x27;s perfect for a daytime mascara all on it&#x27;s own when you want to make yourself presentable, but don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the tiny brush that delivers the mascara to my lashes...I find the application very easy.  The product is easy to remove at night with warm water and a mild eye make-up remover.  I find this mascara to be non-irritating and it does not flake or dry out my lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara was ok. I liked it for it&#x27;s subtlety and wore it to work a lot. There really isn&#x27;t that much product, though, so a tube doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara because my lashes are thinning.  The only problem is that in the description, it showed brown-black, which I prefer.  I received black, which does work for now.</li>
            <li> This is great as it has a really small brush so you do not smudge it and get it every where except your eye lashes and good price.</li>
            <li> Literally my favorite mascara ever. Small applicator gives you total control and allows you to get really close to the lash line, extend and define the lashes. I don&#x27;t use any makeup from the drug store EXCEPT for this. Works so much better than overpriced department store mascara.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a quick make up with minimum mascara; non clumping.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever. Mostly because of the brush--it finds all those tiny lashes and separates nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear mascara. I ordered this very skeptical. I am actually very happy with it. I like the small brush. It makes getting all the lashes easy without a mess. Thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best tool for applying mascara to the lower lashes. The small brush make sit easy to apply product to the corners of lashes or very close to the lashline for a tightline look. It&#x27;s a good, if not, better dupe for clinique&#x27;s bottom lash mascara. There is a bit of a learning curve, if you don;t have a steady hand you&#x27;re gonna get mascara on in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara for the hard to reach places like the back of my upper lashes and the corners of my eyelashes. I still use my favorite mascara for the rest of my lashes, but this is fantistic for getting full coverage. I always keep some on hand!</li>
            <li> Not clumpy, never thick and the small brush lets me grab even the tiny lashes on the inner edge of my eyes without smearing. My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply however it smears/bleeds soon after applying. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and it&#x27;s starts smearing after about 2 hours. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> been using this product for awhile, it goes on easy and light, no clumping, flaking or globbiing. great small brush for getting every lash.&lt;br /&gt;lasts forever...</li>
            <li> Lash Discovery advertises mascara that lengthens and defines: exclusive lash-castching mini brush lengthens &amp; defines. No clumps no globs.&lt;br /&gt;I have very short Asian lashes that are almost non-existent and these really lengthened them by almost double! It&#x27;s so surprising! And as far as the product states, it doesn&#x27;t clump or glob (yet, we&#x27;ll see in a couple of months) Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Great mascara when you don&#x27;t want to look like you are obviously wearing mascara. Love it for work and everyday look.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different mascara at checkout. And somehow received this when I was suppose to get maybeline full and soft. Not one to cause a stink over a few bucks, and call and complain. This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used can&#x27;t wait for it to be empty.</li>
            <li> All time fave, the small brush allows for great coverage.  Consistent coverage and color for many years-truly the best!</li>
