            <li> I knew the minute I removed the box from the plastic that these soaps were old.  The box smelled musty and when I opened the box the soaps did not have the sweet fragrance of the Maja soaps!!!!  Why would you send these stale soaps to a customer??????  I am soooooo disappointed with these soaps. The women in my family have been using these soaps for decades.  My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother used Maja!!!!!!  In all the years I have used Maja I have never ran across a box of Maja soaps that did not smell like Maja soaps!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> interesting soap for guest bath or gifts. I like it, has an exotic scent, but probably won&#x27;t keep a stock of it, but would use as a gift for women</li>

            <li> Marvelous soap.  My wife loves it.  Fragrance sweetens the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li> one comment - the scent does not last long at all</li>
            <li> It was not the original maja scent. It was  a cheap  imitation.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance!  Remember it from years ago.</li>
            <li> For the price, you would have thought that the bars would be of your slandered size!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a quarter the size, you are luck to get maybe 3 baths out of one bar.&lt;br /&gt;I will never order this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. it costs a bit more but it has such a great scent. I am buying more as gifts this holiday season.</li>
            <li> Bought this Maja soap as a birthday gift for a friend whohappend to love it. She was happy so I was happy. It was a good buy!</li>
            <li> Exatly what I wanted.  My wife loves the soap and we could not find it in town.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Lasts long.</li>
            <li> The soaps come in square box...not round soaps. They are only 1.5 oz each. Refunds are not the norm....Amazon did refund me after I brought it to their attention these are misrepresented in description. Don&#x27;t BUY!! I have bought these soaps for 30 years, I know what I&#x27;m purchasing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Prompt, accurate shipment.</li>
            <li> I just love this soap!  My grandmother used to buy it for the granddaughters when we were much younger.  Brings back great memories!</li>
            <li> I have always LOVED the smell of this soap!</li>
