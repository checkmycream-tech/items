            <li>the smell is great and people are always asking why my hair smells so good.</li>
            <li>Product came in good condition</li>
            <li>A good product, but don&#x27;t buy it without checking the price at grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>You may ask, if it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>If your hair ia not too damaged and you&#x27;re looking for a good leave in for every day</li>
            <li>Always a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Its good for to use to de-tangle from the scalp and does not make my scalp greasy.</li>
            <li>I guess this just goes to show that this can be a good product, but just isn&#x27;t made for everyone.</li>
            <li>so it arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed to find a good leave-in treatment after years of box dying my hair</li>
            <li>It is OK, but it isn&#x27;t as great as some people express it to be.</li>
            <li>Great product, wish there was a better price with shipping</li>
            <li>but this stuff does smell delicious (much better than WEN) and quickly transformed my hair into beautiful, healthy looking, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product at works just fine.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, though.</li>
            <li>This leave-in also has a nice sheen to it and smell.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, it smells great!</li>
            <li>This product has a great consistency and the price is not bad.</li>
            <li>It gets frizzy very easily.</li>
            <li>I thought I ruined it, but this stuff helps keep the frizz under control and is making my hair softer and better.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love my infusion 23 strengthens hair and its manageable</li>
            <li>I use this daily great product!!</li>
            <li>I am assuming it is supposed to have more of a conditioner type consistency?</li>
            <li>I love Infusium 23 Leave-in.  </li>
            <li>My hair has become so healthy with continued use of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many leave in conditioners which irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It helps give a bit more body to my hair.  </li>
            <li>if you love shampooing followed by no muss, no fuss, conditioning, you will like this product.  </li>
            <li>Then i spray length of my hair, and one spray for the hair on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe it is because most shampoo/conditioners contain sodium lauryl sulfate, while Infusium contains ammonium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>So of course  I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and I will definetly by more.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and it brings out the curls beautifully.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps her hair strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this for my hair and my wigs leaves them silky and smooth will always use this product love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that I can apply it right after a wash.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>and she commented on my hairs integrity and how easily it would tangle.</li>
            <li>and I myself didn&#x27;t know why my hair was so easily tangled until my hairdresser said it&#x27;s probably from box dyes.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>but it still seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Infusium made my hair smooth and kept it moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be back using Infusium 23.</li>
            <li>Just put some in your hands and smooth away those fuzzies.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, and unfortunately I don&#x27;t enjoy using it, but it does get the job done somehow</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Look at the ingredients - water is the primary ingredient.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m returning to Paul Mitchell Original - which has a consistency that I prefer.</li>
            <li>i love my waves, and thought i wouldnt be able to have both soft and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Infusium 23 is by far my favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love how this leaves my hair smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Infusium :)</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging appropriate from this shipper.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is it&#x27;s not tested on animals...</li>
            <li>Outstanding product &amp; super fast delivery</li>
            <li>this product is great to put in right after i wash my hair if i am going to let it air dry.</li>
            <li>: Its been a few months, and this product is still working great, in case anyone is interested. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>They all leave your hair either super oily, or as if you put glue in your hair .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick remedy to put it in a spray bottle to make it easier to distrubute.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found a place where it was sold since I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase locally.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, and I was excited when I found it many years after I had last used it.</li>
            <li>It really good when you want to blow dry your hair and style your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and I rarely get knots throughout the day, which is my favorite thing about this.</li>
            <li>Anyway, infusium leave in treatment smells great, instantly detangles and makes my hair brushable, leaves it feeling great and not heavy- if it does start to feel heavy, I will mix it with water.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and soft after each use.</li>
            <li>Most of all this product agrees with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>far im in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>but it does help tame fly aways and protect against day to day damage.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>But it is possible, my hair feels so soft and nice!</li>
            <li>then I allow it to dry on its own.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and like it very much</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the repair and renew yet but if it anything like the classic leave in than I expect soft and healthy hair...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m back :)</li>
            <li>and I love them especially the leave-ins</li>
            <li>The fragrance has changed since I last remember from many years ago.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need for my hair in the winter.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft not brittle.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, and makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Great for growth (with all the other proper care steps as well)</li>
            <li>Often, when my hair is thoroughly dry, I spray on a bit more of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have combination hair, greasy on the top, and dry on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love it and wash my hair every two days using it on towel dry hair after showering, before brushing.</li>
            <li>I use Infusium every day for my hair and really like it.  </li>
            <li>theres nothing like the feel of softness from straight</li>
            <li>Makes hair smoother, didn&#x27;t see much of a difference besides that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the leave in treatment, as well as the shampoo and conditioners!</li>
            <li>As long as it&#x27;s available, I-23 will be a mainstay in my haircare arsenal.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid place and this stuff is a miracle worker for my hair in the summer!</li>
            <li>I apply with a spray bottle, which uses less product and spreads it more evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used infusium is some form since junior high.</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store I normally buy it from</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try something new that was in my budget at the time, but I don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>Like many others I spent a very long time looking for a product that worked for my fine, loose curl hair.</li>
            <li>It is definitely helping somewhat, however, for very damaged hair, this won&#x27;t be too much help..</li>
            <li>This magic treatment makes my hair so soft but not oily or feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>Received the product very early.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4B hair</li>
            <li>So far I like it, just used it once.</li>
            <li>She is nearly seven</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has naturally curly/wavy hair and Infusium sort of separates and defines her curls.</li>
            <li>(No glitter or oilyness, just natural shimmer) where as before it was dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even use it in my hair because it adds natural shimmer and body.  </li>
            <li>She has a lot of shrinkage and this helps to stretch her hair out and keep it soft and moisturizer throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and manageable no build up</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>#34;I love this stuff&amp;#34;....or at least not yet.</li>
            <li>By that time it has completely soaked into my hair and I can comb through without any problems.</li>
            <li>What a mess and hand full of hair to show for my efforts to try and control tangles and breakage.</li>
            <li>That said, it made my hair remarkably shiny and soft and in mere moments I had a very different quality of hair on my hands than before I used it.</li>
            <li>But other than that, definitely worth recommending.</li>
            <li>The Infusium 23 Repair was recolmended by my beautician and has helped a lot getting my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and a bit on the thin side.  </li>
            <li>and none actually did anything more than wet the hair down and scent</li>
            <li>I am very much into the wash-and-wear, and I found that most other products, while they helped my curls, often left my hair seriously knotted by the end of the day or &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li>Have been transitioning to more natural hairstyles over the last year, avoiding flat/curling irons and other harsh methods of styling.</li>
            <li>I have tried may other shampoo/conditioner combos, and many of them leave my hair stiff, greasy, and make me have to take another shower.</li>
            <li>definitely has made my hair stronger, and helped it stay soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is a swimmer and goes to swimming lessons and such in a chlorinated pool for nearly four hours a week.  </li>
            <li>I-23 helps minimize split ends, define my natural curls, and improve overall look/feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve tried this only once so far, so if my results change i will update this</li>
            <li>My poor young daughter was blessed with course and easy to tangle hair.  </li>
            <li>Better than not putting anything in but not better than some other products</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll tell you that mine is full and thick but not overly so.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry area and I bleached my hair.  </li>
            <li>Too much protein can weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair only feels this soft when i used to blow dry it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair feels healthy and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> Most of all this product agrees with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> far im in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> but it does help tame fly aways and protect against day to day damage.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> But it is possible, my hair feels so soft and nice!</li>
            <li> then I allow it to dry on its own.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and like it very much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the repair and renew yet but if it anything like the classic leave in than I expect soft and healthy hair...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m back :)</li>
            <li> and I love them especially the leave-ins</li>
            <li> The fragrance has changed since I last remember from many years ago.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need for my hair in the winter.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft not brittle.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, and makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for growth (with all the other proper care steps as well)</li>
            <li> Often, when my hair is thoroughly dry, I spray on a bit more of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have combination hair, greasy on the top, and dry on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love it and wash my hair every two days using it on towel dry hair after showering, before brushing.</li>
            <li> I use Infusium every day for my hair and really like it.  </li>
            <li> theres nothing like the feel of softness from straight</li>
            <li> Makes hair smoother, didn&#x27;t see much of a difference besides that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the leave in treatment, as well as the shampoo and conditioners!</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s available, I-23 will be a mainstay in my haircare arsenal.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid place and this stuff is a miracle worker for my hair in the summer!</li>
            <li> I apply with a spray bottle, which uses less product and spreads it more evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used infusium is some form since junior high.</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store I normally buy it from</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try something new that was in my budget at the time, but I don&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> Like many others I spent a very long time looking for a product that worked for my fine, loose curl hair.</li>
            <li> It is definitely helping somewhat, however, for very damaged hair, this won&#x27;t be too much help..</li>
            <li> This magic treatment makes my hair so soft but not oily or feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Received the product very early.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4B hair</li>
            <li> So far I like it, just used it once.</li>
            <li> She is nearly seven</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has naturally curly/wavy hair and Infusium sort of separates and defines her curls.</li>
            <li> (No glitter or oilyness, just natural shimmer) where as before it was dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even use it in my hair because it adds natural shimmer and body.  </li>
            <li> She has a lot of shrinkage and this helps to stretch her hair out and keep it soft and moisturizer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and manageable no build up</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> #34;I love this stuff&amp;#34;....or at least not yet.</li>
            <li> By that time it has completely soaked into my hair and I can comb through without any problems.</li>
            <li> What a mess and hand full of hair to show for my efforts to try and control tangles and breakage.</li>
            <li> That said, it made my hair remarkably shiny and soft and in mere moments I had a very different quality of hair on my hands than before I used it.</li>
            <li> But other than that, definitely worth recommending.</li>
            <li> The Infusium 23 Repair was recolmended by my beautician and has helped a lot getting my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and a bit on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> and none actually did anything more than wet the hair down and scent</li>
            <li> I am very much into the wash-and-wear, and I found that most other products, while they helped my curls, often left my hair seriously knotted by the end of the day or &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li> Have been transitioning to more natural hairstyles over the last year, avoiding flat/curling irons and other harsh methods of styling.</li>
            <li> I have tried may other shampoo/conditioner combos, and many of them leave my hair stiff, greasy, and make me have to take another shower.</li>
            <li> definitely has made my hair stronger, and helped it stay soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is a swimmer and goes to swimming lessons and such in a chlorinated pool for nearly four hours a week.  </li>
            <li> I-23 helps minimize split ends, define my natural curls, and improve overall look/feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve tried this only once so far, so if my results change i will update this</li>
            <li> My poor young daughter was blessed with course and easy to tangle hair.  </li>
            <li> Better than not putting anything in but not better than some other products</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll tell you that mine is full and thick but not overly so.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area and I bleached my hair.  </li>
            <li> Too much protein can weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair only feels this soft when i used to blow dry it</li>
            <li> It is very thin but it works okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this product knowing that not every product works the same with everyone&#x27;s hair, but this just made my hair dry and and feel a bit wiry.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and curly, and often dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely is improving the texture of the dry hair but not to any degree that I would say &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, i put the product in a spray bottle as the other reviews advised, i washed my hair, and i gently towel dried it a bit.</li>
            <li> De tangles my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a child for my long hair to help detangle it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It works equally as well on both wet and dry</li>
            <li> and it had a very different smell then any of the other bottles I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> With permed and colored hair, my hair starts looking dry and the curls flatten rapidly just a couple of days after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dry hair before bed and also on my damp hair after showering.</li>
            <li> Just one month later, though, I found the same product in several stores at prices as little as half what I paid here.</li>
            <li> it dried, i was STUNNED, my hair was so soft to the touch, it was not frizzy at all, and i only had a few tangles.</li>
            <li> I just put it in a spray bottle and put it in her hair after a bath on wet hair, or on dry hair while I am styling it.  </li>
            <li> Its still wavy, obviously, but its much less defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recently dyed my hair lighter for the summer and their was a little breakage on the the ends...</li>
            <li> Only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> this thing actually costs so MUCH LESS in other stores...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrific being not too goopy and heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> so I expected that when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other styling products.</li>
            <li> I transfer it from the big bottle into a small sprayer and spray my hair as soon as I step out of the shower- wrap it up in a towel and leave it until I&#x27;m done with my makeup.</li>
            <li> It helps tame the grey!</li>
            <li> Leave-in conditioners with heavy oils and harsh fragrances can cause facial breakouts for people with sensitive skin; however, Infusium-23 is not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and long (now to the middle of my back - at one point in time it was past my butt) and Infusium allows me to comb through my hair while wet without destroying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years, I have super thin curly hair, because it&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> I also spray it in whenever I feel like my hair needs to be calmed down between styling/washes.</li>
            <li> Somehow it adds body (So it does not weight the hair down at all) and now receives compliments on how her hair shimmers.</li>
            <li> Well this must have been watered down because it was taped shut</li>
            <li> I have tried every other line, from less expensive things like John Frieda and Herbal Essences to upper line stuff, like Paul Mitchell and Biolage, and this is the only product that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, because I&#x27;m human and I get bored of the same routine, and after 15 years of using it, said to myself,\\&quot;Hey, why not try something</li>
            <li> My hair is severely damaged from several harsh bleaching treatments and I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that would make it at least manageable until I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is about what I expected as I have used the product in the past.</li>
            <li> i have long thick curly-wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product - now I am just disappointed.</li>
            <li> During the past few months I&#x27;ve tried other products like Fx Curls UP</li>
            <li> I put a little in my hands then run it through my hair, comb my hair again, throw it up into a towel for a few minutes</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday--</li>
            <li> I wasted my money for nothing.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say I didn&#x27;t waste my money and if my opinion changes on it after using it a while longer I&#x27;ll repost a review.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few days and already notice a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Lately my hair has been very dry, and felt a little rough to the tough, and i was getting  alot of tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product helps tame some of the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that sometimes gets a few small curls here and there.</li>
            <li> These shameless scalpers sell them for 11-16 dollars here, this is insane, if taken into consideration that the stuff costs at most 4 dollars in reality.</li>
            <li> It is simply not in a formula you&#x27;d expect for a conditioner and it is difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in our local stores, and I appreciate that you stock this item.  </li>
            <li> I put in a small spray bottle and spray over my hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding hair products that I like.</li>
            <li> it was all just cold water that was sort of a murky white color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like \\&quot;no more tears\\&quot; for adults!</li>
            <li> It did not feel/look greasy, which is a relief.the only bad thing</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is not pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It tends to get everywhere when I try to use it and wished it at least came in a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> Delivery was very slow.</li>
            <li> Made my hair stiff sticky and impossible to comb through.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this watery mess; no substance at all.</li>
            <li> It is not an expensive product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with infusium and so grateful that I found it.</li>
            <li> it tends to puffs up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Very sad...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Worst product unless you want to tear out your hair.</li>
            <li> This product gave my hair a terrible feel and did nothing to help my ends or moisturize my hair.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best! I have natural 4B hair and I use it everyday-- definitely has made my hair stronger, and helped it stay soft throughout the day. I refresh with it as well during the day! Great for growth (with all the other proper care steps as well)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding hair products that I like. I have fine curly and frizzy hair. This product helps tame some of the frizz. It is very thin but it works okay.</li>
            <li> When I find a product that works for me, I stay with it. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Friz? Dryness? Get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product &amp; super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Received the product very early. This product has a great consistency and the price is not bad. Infusium made my hair smooth and kept it moisturized. You must buy this product.</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area and I bleached my hair.  I thought I ruined it, but this stuff helps keep the frizz under control and is making my hair softer and better.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this watery mess; no substance at all.Had to pour it in a spray bottle to use. Made my hair stiff sticky and impossible to comb through. What a mess and hand full of hair to show for my efforts to try and control tangles and breakage. Worst product unless you want to tear out your hair.</li>
            <li> A good product, but don&#x27;t buy it without checking the price at grocery stores.  It is not an expensive product.</li>
            <li> This product gave my hair a terrible feel and did nothing to help my ends or moisturize my hair.  Not buying this brand again...</li>
            <li> So far I like it, just used it once. Delivery was very slow.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, and I was excited when I found it many years after I had last used it. Just one month later, though, I found the same product in several stores at prices as little as half what I paid here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years, I have super thin curly hair, because it&#x27;s so thin it tends to puffs up like crazy. If you know the three stooges, we&#x27;ll I&#x27;m Larry. I always keep a bottle of Infusium just incase. During the past few months I&#x27;ve tried other products like Fx Curls UP and Tresemme \\&quot;flawless curls cream\\&quot; and some root stimulator olive oil cream and ALL are horrible. They all leave your hair either super oily, or as if you put glue in your hair . Very sad... so I&#x27;m back :) You may ask, if it&#x27;s so good why did you stop using it? Well, because I&#x27;m human and I get bored of the same routine, and after 15 years of using it, said to myself,\\&quot;Hey, why not try something new?\\&quot; I regret that I did. I wasted my money for nothing. I&#x27;m happy to be back using Infusium 23. Thanks Infusium :)</li>
            <li> I have used infusium hair products for years and I love them especially the leave-ins...I haven&#x27;t used the repair and renew yet but if it anything like the classic leave in than I expect soft and healthy hair...I have recently dyed my hair lighter for the summer and their was a little breakage on the the ends...so I am hopeful this will help in rebuilding my hair...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Since the product has a watery consistency, I put it in a spray bottle and apply the product like that. Usually I use it on my damp hair after a shower and it really helps keep the frizz away! I also spray it in whenever I feel like my hair needs to be calmed down between styling/washes. I live in a humid place and this stuff is a miracle worker for my hair in the summer!</li>
            <li> It is definitely helping somewhat, however, for very damaged hair, this won&#x27;t be too much help.. However, it does do some repair. My only recommendation - DON&#x27;T buy it here on Amazon... this thing actually costs so MUCH LESS in other stores... These shameless scalpers sell them for 11-16 dollars here, this is insane, if taken into consideration that the stuff costs at most 4 dollars in reality.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for about $6. I don&#x27;t see any noticeable change in my hair but it does help tame fly aways and protect against day to day damage. I guess i was hoping a miracle for my damaged bleached hair. If your hair ia not too damaged and you&#x27;re looking for a good leave in for every day use this is it! If like me your hair is bleached fried, then keep looking.. it wont improve your hair.</li>
            <li> Always a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li> My poor young daughter was blessed with course and easy to tangle hair.  She is nearly seven and we have been trying all sorts of detanglers out there and none actually did anything more than wet the hair down and scent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is different.  I know this is a leave in conditioner but please you need to try it off label as a detangler!!!  I just put it in a spray bottle and put it in her hair after a bath on wet hair, or on dry hair while I am styling it.  It works equally as well on both wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has naturally curly/wavy hair and Infusium sort of separates and defines her curls. Somehow it adds body (So it does not weight the hair down at all) and now receives compliments on how her hair shimmers. (No glitter or oilyness, just natural shimmer) where as before it was dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a swimmer and goes to swimming lessons and such in a chlorinated pool for nearly four hours a week.  This stuff keeps her hair strong and healthy looking. I even use it in my hair because it adds natural shimmer and body.  We have been using it for several months now and there is no need to try another type of product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance has changed since I last remember from many years ago. Smells ok, not overpowering. De tangles my long hair. My hair feels healthy and soft after each use. Its good for to use to de-tangle from the scalp and does not make my scalp greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this for my hair and my wigs leaves them silky and smooth will always use this product love it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need for my hair in the winter. Love this!!</li>
            <li> It really good when you want to blow dry your hair and style your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Repair &amp; Renew Leave In Treatment for years. When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store I normally buy it from and I found it on Amazon. This morning I opened it up and put it on my hair and it had a very different smell then any of the other bottles I&#x27;ve bought but it still seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> it leaked out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I use Infusium every day for my hair and really like it.  For a leave in conditioner it&#x27;s terrific being not too goopy and heavy or sticky.  It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft not brittle.  Shipping was fast and packaging appropriate from this shipper.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great.  If you have frizzy ends, you can use this without fear of it being obvious.  Just put some in your hands and smooth away those fuzzies.  It does not leave a sticky feel.  Have used it for years.  My husband loves it too.  It helps tame the grey!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I liked this product. I had read a review in the paper and thought I would try it. With permed and colored hair, my hair starts looking dry and the curls flatten rapidly just a couple of days after shampooing. I now take this liquid in the palm of my hands and run it through my hair and it brings it back to life.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no question that whatever they put in this bottle is beneficial and does wonders for the hair. The problem is that it is not pleasant to use. It is simply not in a formula you&#x27;d expect for a conditioner and it is difficult to manage. It is as watery as all the reviews say. So how do you go about using it? Do you just pour the bottle over your head...do you measure out a bunch and just use that amount. You&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quickly. That said, it made my hair remarkably shiny and soft and in mere moments I had a very different quality of hair on my hands than before I used it. I still prefer the WEN products.... but this stuff does smell delicious (much better than WEN) and quickly transformed my hair into beautiful, healthy looking, shiny hair. It made my split heads virtually disappear and any frizziness as well. Like I said, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, and unfortunately I don&#x27;t enjoy using it, but it does get the job done somehow and I guess in the end that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair from bleaching or whatever this is for you</li>
            <li> I love my infusion 23 strengthens hair and its manageable its great!!! Thank You</li>
            <li> Personally I do not care for this product. It is OK, but it isn&#x27;t as great as some people express it to be. I bought this product knowing that not every product works the same with everyone&#x27;s hair, but this just made my hair dry and and feel a bit wiry. My hair is short and curly, and often dry. I think I will stick to a thicker leave-in-conditioner like Giovanni&#x27;s Weightless Leave-In-Conditioner because I like the consistency and what it does to my hair. I just wanted to try something new that was in my budget at the time, but I don&#x27;t like this. However, this works well on my you get sisters hair. She has a lot of shrinkage and this helps to stretch her hair out and keep it soft and moisturizer throughout the day. I guess this just goes to show that this can be a good product, but just isn&#x27;t made for everyone.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and manageable no build up I have natural hair 3b/4c I use this daily great product!!</li>
            <li> I have Prime so it arrived on time and in good condition. I purchased this to use on my over processed color treated hair. When reading reviews I couldn&#x27;t find anyone who said what type of hair they have so I&#x27;ll tell you that mine is full and thick but not overly so. I color treat it for grays around the edges and highlight with blonde.  I had read the product was watery so I expected that when I opened it. It&#x27;s a quick remedy to put it in a spray bottle to make it easier to distrubute. I used it on my dry hair before bed and also on my damp hair after showering. It isn&#x27;t greasey and seems to absorb into my hair. In the morning my hair isn&#x27;t sticky or oily from using it overnight.  It definitely is improving the texture of the dry hair but not to any degree that I would say &amp;#34;I love this stuff&amp;#34;....or at least not yet. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days. So I&#x27;d say I didn&#x27;t waste my money and if my opinion changes on it after using it a while longer I&#x27;ll repost a review.</li>
            <li> For some reason the one Amazon sent me was just basically water. I am assuming it is supposed to have more of a conditioner type consistency? Well this must have been watered down because it was taped shut and when I went to squirt it out it was all just cold water that was sort of a murky white color. I was excited to try this product - now I am just disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good for everyone!  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product, wish there was a better price with shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely lives up to its promises! My hair is severely damaged from several harsh bleaching treatments and I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that would make it at least manageable until I bought this stuff. The only reason I give it four starts instead of five is because I wish it wasn&#x27;t so watery. It tends to get everywhere when I try to use it and wished it at least came in a spray bottle! But other than that, definitely worth recommending.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I love Infusium 23 Leave-in.  My hair has become so healthy with continued use of this product.  This leave-in also has a nice sheen to it and smell.  Most of all this product agrees with my sensitive skin.  I have gone through many leave in conditioners which irritated my skin.  Leave-in conditioners with heavy oils and harsh fragrances can cause facial breakouts for people with sensitive skin; however, Infusium-23 is not at all irritating. Now my skin does not have to suffer for my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a child for my long hair to help detangle it. Makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Have used Infusium 23 off-and-on since the 80s. Have been transitioning to more natural hairstyles over the last year, avoiding flat/curling irons and other harsh methods of styling. I-23 helps minimize split ends, define my natural curls, and improve overall look/feel of my hair. I apply with a spray bottle, which uses less product and spreads it more evenly throughout my hair. As long as it&#x27;s available, I-23 will be a mainstay in my haircare arsenal.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my hairdresser.  It is difficult to find in our local stores, and I appreciate that you stock this item.  It would take a lot of searching to find this item on a shelf in a store.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my thick frizzy hair.  Better than not putting anything in but not better than some other products</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works well, it&#x27;s priced well and it&#x27;s a cruelty free product. What else could you want in a hair product! It was delivered very quickly in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and a bit on the thin side.  I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my scalp.  It helps give a bit more body to my hair.  It&#x27;s nice that I can apply it right after a wash.  Often, when my hair is thoroughly dry, I spray on a bit more of this product.  I am so glad I found a place where it was sold since I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase locally.</li>
            <li> if you love shampooing followed by no muss, no fuss, conditioning, you will like this product.  I have used it for years, and it leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far so good, it smells great!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and like it very much</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that sometimes gets a few small curls here and there. It gets frizzy very easily. I have combination hair, greasy on the top, and dry on the bottom. Lately my hair has been very dry, and felt a little rough to the tough, and i was getting  alot of tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Tried:&lt;br /&gt;Dermorganic argon oil - left my hair so greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo leave in conditioner - again greasy and weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve tried this only once so far, so if my results change i will update this post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i put the product in a spray bottle as the other reviews advised, i washed my hair, and i gently towel dried it a bit. Then i spray length of my hair, and one spray for the hair on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dried, i was STUNNED, my hair was so soft to the touch, it was not frizzy at all, and i only had a few tangles. My hair only feels this soft when i used to blow dry it (i stopped cause im growing out my hair) theres nothing like the feel of softness from straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i love my waves, and thought i wouldnt be able to have both soft and wavy hair. But it is possible, my hair feels so soft and nice! It did not feel/look greasy, which is a relief.the only bad thing is that my waves have lessened, but i can deal with that. Its still wavy, obviously, but its much less defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far im in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Its been a few months, and this product is still working great, in case anyone is interested. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It is about what I expected as I have used the product in the past. Don&#x27;t know that it improves the condition of the hair but it is a non sticky leave in treatment that sets the hair rather than using a gel.</li>
            <li> Like many others I spent a very long time looking for a product that worked for my fine, loose curl hair. I am very much into the wash-and-wear, and I found that most other products, while they helped my curls, often left my hair seriously knotted by the end of the day or &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; looking. This product is amazing, though. It leaves my hair super soft and I rarely get knots throughout the day, which is my favorite thing about this. I have tried every other line, from less expensive things like John Frieda and Herbal Essences to upper line stuff, like Paul Mitchell and Biolage, and this is the only product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on immediately when I get out of the shower after combing through my hair. I put a little in my hands then run it through my hair, comb my hair again, throw it up into a towel for a few minutes then I allow it to dry on its own. I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Makes hair smoother, didn&#x27;t see much of a difference besides that. Only need to use a little at a time. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I have used Infusium leave in treatment for over 20 years. My hair is thin and long (now to the middle of my back - at one point in time it was past my butt) and Infusium allows me to comb through my hair while wet without destroying it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other styling products. I transfer it from the big bottle into a small sprayer and spray my hair as soon as I step out of the shower- wrap it up in a towel and leave it until I&#x27;m done with my makeup. By that time it has completely soaked into my hair and I can comb through without any problems. It&#x27;s like \\&quot;no more tears\\&quot; for adults! Adore this product!</li>
            <li> i have long thick curly-wavy hair. this product is great to put in right after i wash my hair if i am going to let it air dry. keeps the frizz away. isnt greasy or crunchy. makes my hair smooth and shiny. been using it off and on since 2001.</li>
            <li> Look at the ingredients - water is the primary ingredient.  I hate the consistency of Infusium 23, and bought it because of the great reviews here on Amazon.  The only good thing about it is it&#x27;s not tested on animals...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning to Paul Mitchell Original - which has a consistency that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Have had a lot of hair breakage recently which they say is stress.  The Infusium 23 Repair was recolmended by my beautician and has helped a lot getting my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Infusium 23 is by far my favorite conditioner! It smells great, and makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. I have tried may other shampoo/conditioner combos, and many of them leave my hair stiff, greasy, and make me have to take another shower. I believe it is because most shampoo/conditioners contain sodium lauryl sulfate, while Infusium contains ammonium laureth sulfate. This difference in ingredients makes a big difference in how it makes my hair look and feel! I will never buy another shampoo/conditioner duo! Customer for life...</li>
            <li> This magic treatment makes my hair so soft but not oily or feeling heavy. It is the perfect conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I put in a small spray bottle and spray over my hair before blow drying. It smells amazing and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used infusium is some form since junior high. So of course  I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my hair smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for curly hair; defines curls without stiffness.</li>
            <li> Saw this was used for bleached hair in a blog didn&#x27;t think it would work. I have used it for a few days and already notice a difference in my hair. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with infusium and so grateful that I found it. I decided I needed to find a good leave-in treatment after years of box dying my hair, I went to the salon and she commented on my hairs integrity and how easily it would tangle. I have very long hair and I myself didn&#x27;t know why my hair was so easily tangled until my hairdresser said it&#x27;s probably from box dyes. I didn&#x27;t even know that that was so damaging! Anyway, infusium leave in treatment smells great, instantly detangles and makes my hair brushable, leaves it feeling great and not heavy- if it does start to feel heavy, I will mix it with water. Too much protein can weigh hair down. I love it and wash my hair every two days using it on towel dry hair after showering, before brushing. I highly recommend the leave in treatment, as well as the shampoo and conditioners! It saved my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for repairing damage to my hair and for holding the curls in. I have used this product for a couple of years and will continue to use it. I have natural curly hair and it brings out the curls beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for some time. I think this is a great product at works just fine. the smell is great and people are always asking why my hair smells so good. I would recommend it and I will definetly by more.</li>
