            <li>amazing product one of my favorites</li>
            <li>but it looks nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shade, the sculpt color is neutral brown and not sparkly at all.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this contour kit!!</li>
            <li>But Highly pigmented and works great!</li>
            <li>I really love this brand of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Its ok to me</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>And RM Cosmetics service is outstanding.</li>
            <li>For the areas that I really want to bump up, I&#x27;d use my Mary loumanizer, but this is great for tip of the nose, and Cupid&#x27;s bow.</li>
            <li>I realy love this contour set.</li>
            <li>I love the contouring  color but wish the highlighter was a tad lighter.</li>
            <li>I really love it and that&#x27;s why I got it for a friend as well.  </li>
            <li>I will def need a darker color though once i start tanning come the spring :)</li>
            <li>i think a cream will work better than a powder</li>
            <li>Highlights are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>I found a contour shade that I enjoy more, but this one suffices.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sleek Makeup product and I must say I am in love!</li>
            <li>I got the light kit and the light is more of a shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Stays put all day and easily blends out.  </li>
            <li>The brown is a good shade but the pink is to light for blush, so I apply it over my blush for a nice highlighted effect.</li>
            <li>I ordered the contour kits both in light and medium.</li>
            <li>I use the light for daytime looks and the medium for night as it gives me a bolder contour.</li>
            <li>Although the light can be built up for a starker contrast.</li>
            <li>I bought the light version of this.</li>
            <li>it goes smooth on skin.  </li>
            <li>Really makes you look amazing</li>
            <li>, deff worth a try for so cheap!</li>
            <li>if you use too much, you can look muddy very easily.</li>
            <li>I like the contour for special occasions</li>
            <li>Both powders are so finely milled and creamy that they glide right on.</li>
            <li>tha price is good,it works beautifully buildable coverage for a dark contour.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>got here in less than a week and the colors are beautiful and pigmented.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the contour that much anymore, but this is my favorite, every day high lighter, for sure</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for, the darker color is matt, which is great for us gals who are on the old side of young.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have!!</li>
            <li>The color online shows more of purple color, but in reality it is brown and very light pink highlight.  </li>
            <li>They shipped right away</li>
            <li>The shading color is a great shade that doesn&#x27;t look orange or too dark, at least not on my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>This product worked better than I expected it to and I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>This is my first Contour kit</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>This shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Most definitely will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The powders are so finely milled and soft, not chalky at all, which was my main concern with the highlighter.</li>
            <li>This one is excellent when I&#x27;m pale during winter or when I have a little color in the summer.</li>
            <li>It is only for LIGHT skin</li>
            <li>and it is definitely too light for me).</li>
            <li>This item wasn&#x27;t very pigmented and didn&#x27;t match my skin well.</li>
            <li>In the photo the light version has almost a purple tint to it but the actual powders are flesh-colored.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented!</li>
            <li>Blends much better than other highlighter/contouring kits I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My package arrived 5 days earlier than expected which was nice.</li>
            <li>quite pigmented so use a light hand, i dont really have anything bad to say about this product, i do wish that the highlighter would show up more in photos although, summers coming up and no one wants to be super shiny looking.</li>
            <li>Shiny makes the pores pop and seemingly double in size, and that&#x27;s never a good thing; so I only use the light, more shimmery power high on cheekbones, across temple, bridge of the nose and chin only...</li>
            <li>Since summer, I have gotten pale and purchased the light</li>
            <li>NOW that contour is the new big thing, these kits are selling for 45+ dollars!!</li>
            <li>this is very natural looking, if you are a fan of the shimmery highlighters like i am you might want to try a different highlighter but for everyday this is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>it isnt too dark, very neutral not to gray not red.</li>

            <li> I use this daily, as a subtle highlight.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and almost every other contour/bronzer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this because I find a lot of high street or drugstore product have think, chunky powders and overly glittery highlighters, but this was way beyond expecations.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this till late July I got it in 7 days from the day I purchased!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to give it a bad name</li>

            <li> This is my first Contour kit and I love it!  It is exactly what I was looking for, the darker color is matt, which is great for us gals who are on the old side of young. This shade is what you use to shape and contour the face, sculpt the cheek bones, sharpen jawline, etc.  Shiny makes the pores pop and seemingly double in size, and that&#x27;s never a good thing; so I only use the light, more shimmery power high on cheekbones, across temple, bridge of the nose and chin only...then blend, blend, blend! These colors do blend wonderfully  Again, packaging was great and the product arrived in perfect condition from seller.</li>
            <li> My package arrived 5 days earlier than expected which was nice. I wish we had this brand in America. The powders are so finely milled and soft, not chalky at all, which was my main concern with the highlighter. I bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade as i am quite fair (MAC nc15) it isnt too dark, very neutral not to gray not red. quite pigmented so use a light hand, i dont really have anything bad to say about this product, i do wish that the highlighter would show up more in photos although, summers coming up and no one wants to be super shiny looking. this is very natural looking, if you are a fan of the shimmery highlighters like i am you might want to try a different highlighter but for everyday this is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> Awesome Contour and highlighter. I really love this brand of makeup.  Shipping was fast!  Would def purchase again. Love that it has a mirror too!</li>
            <li> Its ok to me i don&#x27;t want to give it a bad name but i feel like the highlighter is a bit shimmery and the contour powder is a bit chalky but maybe in not using it correctly ive only used it once</li>
            <li> Didnt like it kinda muddy looking</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it was lighter then I expected.  The color online shows more of purple color, but in reality it is brown and very light pink highlight.  The brown is a good shade but the pink is to light for blush, so I apply it over my blush for a nice highlighted effect.</li>

            <li> Just got this in the mail.  I got the light kit and the light is more of a shimmer.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that but it looks nice.  Blends much better than other highlighter/contouring kits I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The product is very good.  The product blends well and the looks good.  Seems to last and stay on ... I like it a lot.  I use it on friends when I do their make up.  It is only for LIGHT skin (I have olive skin and it is definitely too light for me).</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve gotten this kit. Since summer, I have gotten pale and purchased the light and I love it! i still use the medium to contour my neck.</li>

            <li> I ordered the contour kits both in light and medium. Both are great, matte without the orange undertone. I use the light for daytime looks and the medium for night as it gives me a bolder contour. Although the light can be built up for a starker contrast. Highlights are pretty good as well. Definitely recommend the products. And RM Cosmetics service is outstanding. They shipped right away and I got my products undamaged and way sooner than what was expected considering they came from the UK. I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again.</li>

Most definitely will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, as a subtle highlight. For the areas that I really want to bump up, I&#x27;d use my Mary loumanizer, but this is great for tip of the nose, and Cupid&#x27;s bow. I don&#x27;t use the contour that much anymore, but this is my favorite, every day high lighter, for sure</li>

            <li> I realy love this contour set. I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> great for beginners to contouring!</li>
            <li> This item wasn&#x27;t very pigmented and didn&#x27;t match my skin well. The highlighter was too shimmery and yet didn&#x27;t show up well. I returned the item</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this product blended perfect.  I wont use any other product for powder contouring. I was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the dark contour color, however the highlighting color has too much shimmer and looked terrible on me.</li>
            <li> I love the contouring  color but wish the highlighter was a tad lighter. The shading color is a great shade that doesn&#x27;t look orange or too dark, at least not on my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I saw Fleur of FleurDeForce on Youtube usuing this and reccomending it as a lower-priced alternative to contouring/bronzing powder. I was skeptical about purchasing this because I find a lot of high street or drugstore product have think, chunky powders and overly glittery highlighters, but this was way beyond expecations. Both powders are so finely milled and creamy that they glide right on. The highlighter has just enough shimmer to enhance the face without enlarging pores or looking cakey. I also have fairly light skin (I wear Chanel Perfection Lumiere in 12 Beige Rose), and the color match was perfect! I will be using this product often, and I&#x27;m already looking forward to purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I bought the light version of this. In the photo the light version has almost a purple tint to it but the actual powders are flesh-colored. The highlighter is too shimmery for my liking. It makes my skin look oily almost. I like the contour for special occasions, it&#x27;s very pigmented. However I probably wouldn’t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I expected it to and I will definitely be buying more! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have!! The highlighter works great it goes smooth on skin.  I recommend this item for someone who loves to try newvmake up</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this contour kit!! I have pale skin and almost every other contour/bronzer looks orange on me. This one is excellent when I&#x27;m pale during winter or when I have a little color in the summer.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this little contour kit, once for me and once for a friend.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now and it&#x27;s a trooper.  Stays put all day and easily blends out.  It&#x27;s a nice shade, the sculpt color is neutral brown and not sparkly at all.  The highlight is similar to &amp;#34;mary lou manizer&amp;#34; by the Balm.  I really love it and that&#x27;s why I got it for a friend as well.  NOW that contour is the new big thing, these kits are selling for 45+ dollars!! It&#x27;s crazyyyyy, I went to find her a kit and decided to just go back to sleek.  Excellent price for this product.</li>
            <li> Never used contour kit before tried this and I love it!!!! Really makes you look amazing, deff worth a try for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly pigmented! I love it! I will def need a darker color though once i start tanning come the spring :)</li>
            <li> I choose it to countour the face&lt;br /&gt;Also Sleek it is a wounderful brand&lt;br /&gt;The color match my skin&lt;br /&gt;Thanx for the buyer</li>
            <li> i think a cream will work better than a powder</li>
            <li> I love it so much. It does make my face smaller!! And i will keep buying it! glad I found this product!</li>
