            <li>This stuff has been the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>It is probably the best acne cream that I have used.</li>
            <li>However, I can say that after two months of using this product it is the best thing I have found for my acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>

            <li>and wow..My skin looks happy!.</li>
            <li>and I have never ever been so happy with anything else.  </li>
            <li>, this just works great for the acne.  </li>
            <li>It also works great under makeup.</li>
            <li>I experienced noticeable results after 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do miracles but if used correctly over time it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for my acne; in my case better than prescription gels or antibiotics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 (ish) fair skinned woman, who&#x27;s always had acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many acne products and none have performed like this one!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I think this product deserves it!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to use this product and get results within a day!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>As good or better than the reviews on amazon say.</li>
            <li>but it did more harm than good for me.  </li>
            <li>I wish La Roche Posay was still offering their original formula, which was so effective and smelled great.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, effective and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Now that it is available on Amazon.com, I&#x27;m so overwhelmed with happiness.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried all the major brands, but this works best for him.</li>
            <li>I am just about to the point of wearing no foundation or concealer, and that is HUGE!</li>
            <li>In one week I feel much more confident than I have in years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome for use on occasional blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried literally hundreds of beauty products from many countries and in every price range.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad</li>
            <li>B002JL1Y6C Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Aczone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products including Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for some</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for bringing such great products to us!</li>
            <li>Retin-A Micro gave me really dry skin, so after I cut that out, everything else worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is that good.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for my type of skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get about 4 or 5 huge bumps on my jaws and along my chin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle on my skin, smells nice, and in just the two days I&#x27;ve been using it I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li>When applied to the whole face after a warm shower just before bed, you wake up with a clearer, cleaner, tighter face.  </li>
            <li>The whole consistency of the product has changed, the way it works changed, and when you begin using it, it no longer effectively spot treats acne.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, my face just felt better.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for another product and came across the La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Treament and decided to try it since so many others had positive results.    </li>
            <li>Was given a sample from my skin care professional, and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>We have tried other products, but this seems to work the best and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Everything I have tried has either made my skin turn bright red from irritation or it did nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting these deep zits since I was like 13, so it&#x27;s taken me 10 years to find something that works this good.</li>
            <li>Only 2 products have been able to keep my skin clear and happy...</li>
            <li>They say to wait for 2 weeks for full results, and if I&#x27;m this satisfied now it can only get better.</li>
            <li>I used it on my mild acne for over a month</li>
            <li>It smells great, and I did see a reduction in my acne in general but it didn&#x27;t live up to all my expectations.</li>
            <li>When I used the new formula, I got more blackheads</li>
            <li>Might be great if you have a milder case of acne or just a few spotty areas that need treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest ance solution, but I can promise you it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Might not work for everyone, but very much worth a try</li>
            <li>And as before, I developed more acne than what I had before using it.  </li>
            <li>Then I bought this because of all the positive reviews, and let me tell you, they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right, and I still get some breakouts, but this has helped- noticeably.      </li>
            <li>You really feel clean when using this product.</li>
            <li>according to my previous experience using this products, it should be good for acne.</li>
            <li>She does supplement with DermaCare and internal cleaners that assist a great deal, along with diet to avoid chocolate, ice cream, caffeine and deep fried foods.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets easily irritated by daily use of most products, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem using this one.  </li>
            <li>So, I read the reviews here, and as they seemed very promising, I decided to give it a go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been exactly one week today that I got it from Amazon and started using it.</li>
            <li>In the first week of using this I only noticed that my skin was softer, brighter, and more evenly colored.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li>I even stuck it out, finishing the entire tube, thinking my face was just adjusting and might come out better in the end.</li>
            <li>The acne not only resisted the cream, it also appeared to encourage even more outbreak around areas treated.</li>
            <li>and it is absorbed very well into your skin.</li>
            <li>For anyone interested in clearing their acne, I recommend purchasing the Panoxyl 10% BP cream.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the prescription products out there and, aside from accutane, this is the only one that&#x27;s really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and acne free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as expected in good condition and with out expiration</li>
            <li>While this cream may indeed result in positive results for some users, I assure you, it is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>but in my first year of college it really started to become noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old with a mild case of errupting acne.  </li>
            <li>Also, the healing time for acne lessened and they stopped getting as large and inflamed.</li>
            <li>This WILL NOT get rid of cystic acne, but it certainly helps them heal and stops them from growing as large.</li>
            <li>Since, I&#x27;ve hunted for the next best thing, spending a small fortune in vain to simply clear up my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and it works well.  </li>
            <li>It really did help me.</li>
            <li>Nothing made much of an impact</li>
            <li>it works extremely fast &amp; is not overly drying.</li>
            <li>It works on acne-prone face very well.</li>
            <li>I used it as a moisturizer since it&#x27;s really light-weight</li>
            <li>This product is really work on me.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried many products to treat my adult skin that breaks out (especially around the chin area).  </li>
            <li>(As a side note, I also avoided major plastic surgery as a result of the success.)</li>
            <li>Fantastic that this product has worked so well for so long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been reliable ever since I got it, unlike other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; treatments that would work wonderfully on my acne for only a few weeks before my skin adjusted to them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only ever once found an inexpensive and worthy product that worked, then Bath &amp; Body Works decided to discontinue it (figures) about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>The only thing pleasant was the smell, otherwise it was complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>In addition, I&#x27;ve heard from a friend, it worked perfect for her acne problem too; now that she is done with her treatment, she is still using it everyday to reduce the little imperfections she may have left and the size of her pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that would clear the cystic acne up that fast before.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I could continue getting the old formula, and now I have to find a replacement for the product I used to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Effaclar K is great because it&#x27;s an everyday insurance policy againt zits, plus it has a slight exfoliating quality that over time will make one&#x27;s skin smoother.</li>
            <li>Until then, I was spending alot of money to purchase and ship it here into the USA where I live.  </li>
            <li>I thought I try something new and ended up purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>If used regularly, it keeps them from forming in the first place.  </li>
            <li>which is exactly the same look as the pricture shows.    </li>
            <li>Clear skin is very worth an investment of one key product that actually gives results.</li>
            <li>This product while not cheap it is not ridiculously expensive and works far better than other products that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>I ended up going to a dermatologist and getting a couple of prescription creams for acne along with a medicated face wash, which did clear up my existing cystic acne and has so far stopped new acne from forming.  </li>
            <li>Instantly, my skin looks better - smoother, with the pores less visible.  </li>
            <li>Right around the time the bumps would almost be gone, which would take at least 2 weeks, I&#x27;d get 4-5 *new* huge bumps in different places on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a day when I&#x27;m all clear and twice when things start flaring up</li>
            <li>As far as its compatability with sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A 0.1% cream</li>
            <li>I started using this product in 2007, and it kept my face perfectly clear until 2011.</li>
            <li>I would get compliments on my clear skin all the time.</li>
            <li>It clears my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; acne up completely within 24-36 hrs also.</li>
            <li>It reduces visible zits when applied directly to them-</li>
            <li>Adult acne is now gone.  </li>
            <li>This acne treatment works very well for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble with moderate to severe acne for most of my 20s.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t try slathering it onto your skin, you don&#x27;t need very much anyways, and too much will treat your makeup just like a heavy moisturizer would.</li>
            <li>I have not had one new zit since last weekend and any zits I had when I started using this are gone now.</li>
            <li>anyone has any suggestions for products that are similar to the old formula of Effaclar K, please let me know!</li>
            <li>I got this instead of the more difficult and harsh kits that are also available online, though keep in mind</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and even, all the acne has cleared, and the redness from the really bad blemishes is fading more every day.</li>
            <li>I had minimal acne all through high school</li>
            <li>I just received this La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment Fluid, when I open the package, I was surprised because the tube&#x27;s design is different from the picture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product in combination with other Biomedic products from LaRoche-Posay for the treatment of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the positive reviews, I decided to waste $20+ on it to see if it will help.</li>

            <li> This WILL NOT get rid of cystic acne, but it certainly helps them heal and stops them from growing as large.</li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;ve hunted for the next best thing, spending a small fortune in vain to simply clear up my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and it works well.  </li>
            <li> It really did help me.</li>
            <li> Nothing made much of an impact</li>
            <li> it works extremely fast &amp; is not overly drying.</li>
            <li> It works on acne-prone face very well.</li>
            <li> I used it as a moisturizer since it&#x27;s really light-weight</li>
            <li> This product is really work on me.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried many products to treat my adult skin that breaks out (especially around the chin area).  </li>
            <li> (As a side note, I also avoided major plastic surgery as a result of the success.)</li>
            <li> Fantastic that this product has worked so well for so long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been reliable ever since I got it, unlike other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; treatments that would work wonderfully on my acne for only a few weeks before my skin adjusted to them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only ever once found an inexpensive and worthy product that worked, then Bath &amp; Body Works decided to discontinue it (figures) about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> The only thing pleasant was the smell, otherwise it was complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve heard from a friend, it worked perfect for her acne problem too; now that she is done with her treatment, she is still using it everyday to reduce the little imperfections she may have left and the size of her pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything that would clear the cystic acne up that fast before.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I could continue getting the old formula, and now I have to find a replacement for the product I used to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Effaclar K is great because it&#x27;s an everyday insurance policy againt zits, plus it has a slight exfoliating quality that over time will make one&#x27;s skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Until then, I was spending alot of money to purchase and ship it here into the USA where I live.  </li>
            <li> I thought I try something new and ended up purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> If used regularly, it keeps them from forming in the first place.  </li>
            <li> which is exactly the same look as the pricture shows.    </li>
            <li> Clear skin is very worth an investment of one key product that actually gives results.</li>
            <li> This product while not cheap it is not ridiculously expensive and works far better than other products that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going to a dermatologist and getting a couple of prescription creams for acne along with a medicated face wash, which did clear up my existing cystic acne and has so far stopped new acne from forming.  </li>
            <li> Instantly, my skin looks better - smoother, with the pores less visible.  </li>
            <li> Right around the time the bumps would almost be gone, which would take at least 2 weeks, I&#x27;d get 4-5 *new* huge bumps in different places on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a day when I&#x27;m all clear and twice when things start flaring up</li>
            <li> As far as its compatability with sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A 0.1% cream</li>
            <li> I started using this product in 2007, and it kept my face perfectly clear until 2011.</li>
            <li> I would get compliments on my clear skin all the time.</li>
            <li> It clears my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; acne up completely within 24-36 hrs also.</li>
            <li> It reduces visible zits when applied directly to them-</li>
            <li> Adult acne is now gone.  </li>
            <li> This acne treatment works very well for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble with moderate to severe acne for most of my 20s.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t try slathering it onto your skin, you don&#x27;t need very much anyways, and too much will treat your makeup just like a heavy moisturizer would.</li>
            <li> I have not had one new zit since last weekend and any zits I had when I started using this are gone now.</li>
            <li> anyone has any suggestions for products that are similar to the old formula of Effaclar K, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I got this instead of the more difficult and harsh kits that are also available online, though keep in mind</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and even, all the acne has cleared, and the redness from the really bad blemishes is fading more every day.</li>
            <li> I had minimal acne all through high school</li>
            <li> I just received this La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment Fluid, when I open the package, I was surprised because the tube&#x27;s design is different from the picture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product in combination with other Biomedic products from LaRoche-Posay for the treatment of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the positive reviews, I decided to waste $20+ on it to see if it will help.</li>
            <li> Everything else I have tried irritates my sensitive skin including benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, sulfur, anything with alcohol in it, and even other salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li> Finally, I went to a plastic surgeon to see about some scar treatments, and before he did any major procedures, he put me on a combination of effaclar K, a couple of other biomedic products, Retin-A micro, and I had regular micro-dermabrasion and/or facial peel treatments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I started breaking out with cystic acne for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I will be keeping this in my daily skin care regimen for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> It also did not dry my skin the way all other acne products seem to do.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product long ago.    </li>
            <li> However, after careful application for over a week, the effects were sadly opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if any negative changes happen, but so far, I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know other people&#x27;s recommendations can be annoying, especially when you&#x27;re certain that nothing will work, but I&#x27;d say that this product is worth a try!</li>
            <li> After two weeks my pores were much less clogged and my regular acne started diminishing.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a larger tube, I seem to go through a tube every 2 weeks, and while a tad spendy to buy that often, I am spending much less than when I was trying everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the standard oily T-zone, but with incredibly sensitive skin, and usually have a few blemishes hanging around.  </li>
            <li> I found this product in Paris, and a few years later it started to be exported to the USA.  </li>
            <li> I assumed it has been working as expected, since he mentioned I will be using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Typically, I find if I use a product like this twice a day my skin gets dry and flaky, so I limit to once a day.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and a small tube goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s other treatments for those things anyways</li>
            <li> I tend to go overboard on application, especially on the cystic areas.</li>
            <li> There was not much of a difference in acne other than less swelling.</li>
            <li> I buy a new product, but what I got is a used one, I&#x27;mreally not happy about that.</li>
            <li> Severe acne and uneven skin, sun damage, and unpredictable mood swings of either way too dry or way too oily skin.</li>
            <li> However, I would have much preferred to use this as opposed to expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was going to help with my congested pores, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> She immediately ceased to use it after noting the spreading, and the situation calmed down.</li>
            <li> just works not really fast, little by little, and i never feel hurt when i use it.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating, and I really needed something to deal with this issue.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and my skin is clearer, scaring is going away, and my skin is slightly less oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of the prescriptions from dermatologists, and had little to no success.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> and I disliked using all of them.</li>
            <li> The acidity kills acne-causing bacteria on and below the surface of the skin, dissolving oily residue, preventing clogged pores, and eating away dead skin.    </li>
            <li> It clears up his skin quite nicely in a few days.  </li>
            <li> All I need now is something to diminish a few small scars I have from years of zits.</li>
            <li> I had tried several OTC medications for a topical, but after a month, I was frustrated.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d see no more results.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab.  </li>
            <li> You apply a very thin layer of the cream on your skin, so that little tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s acne-prone and sensitive and reacts badly to anything even slightly comedogenic.</li>
            <li> I moved to a very humid climate that my skin is not used to, and for the last year have suffered from horrible skin problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I am hardly breaking out anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a spectacular treatment for blackheads, but it does make somewhat of a difference</li>
            <li> All expensive, drying, harsh.</li>
            <li> Once again, I&#x27;ve been left disappointed as although this product softens the skin and pores</li>
            <li> I do apply it very thick twice a day, and have not had any bothersome dryness as a result.</li>
            <li> What a waste and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> even worse.</li>
            <li> Now, if I use this product, my acne gets worse.</li>
            <li> Use the Azrec Secret as your mask.</li>
            <li> The thing is, they&#x27;re usually big, gnarly awful zits.</li>
            <li> , sorry.  </li>
            <li> I have weird skin</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately, the product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad for me to give Effaclar K two stars.</li>
            <li> This is my lifeline for clearing my skin, it&#x27;s been clearing up my stubborn cystic acne (horrible curse) within a couple days.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this and the Laroche Evaclar face wash. It&#x27;s been exactly one week today that I got it from Amazon and started using it. Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing. As good or better than the reviews on amazon say. I have not had one new zit since last weekend and any zits I had when I started using this are gone now. I&#x27;ve been getting these deep zits since I was like 13, so it&#x27;s taken me 10 years to find something that works this good. In one week I feel much more confident than I have in years. They say to wait for 2 weeks for full results, and if I&#x27;m this satisfied now it can only get better. You really feel clean when using this product. All I need now is something to diminish a few small scars I have from years of zits. I don&#x27;t think Laroche has a product like that yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the standard oily T-zone, but with incredibly sensitive skin, and usually have a few blemishes hanging around.  The thing is, they&#x27;re usually big, gnarly awful zits. And I have tried everything.  Everything I have tried has either made my skin turn bright red from irritation or it did nothing at all.  This stuff has been the perfect solution.  I use it once a day when I&#x27;m all clear and twice when things start flaring up and I have never ever been so happy with anything else.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest ance solution, but I can promise you it&#x27;s worth it.  Without a doubt.</li>
            <li> This is my lifeline for clearing my skin, it&#x27;s been clearing up my stubborn cystic acne (horrible curse) within a couple days.  I&#x27;ve never found anything that would clear the cystic acne up that fast before. It clears my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; acne up completely within 24-36 hrs also. It&#x27;s been reliable ever since I got it, unlike other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; treatments that would work wonderfully on my acne for only a few weeks before my skin adjusted to them and I&#x27;d see no more results. (I&#x27;ve been using this for just under a year) Fantastic that this product has worked so well for so long.  I use it on my forhead and nose to help control blackheads also.  It&#x27;s not really a spectacular treatment for blackheads, but it does make somewhat of a difference and there&#x27;s other treatments for those things anyways, this just works great for the acne.  As far as its compatability with sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I have no idea how well it works for that, sorry.  It also works great under makeup. Just don&#x27;t try slathering it onto your skin, you don&#x27;t need very much anyways, and too much will treat your makeup just like a heavy moisturizer would.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used most of the prescription products out there and, aside from accutane, this is the only one that&#x27;s really worked for me.  I have very sensitive skin that gets easily irritated by daily use of most products, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem using this one.  It&#x27;s gentle and it works well.  You apply a very thin layer of the cream on your skin, so that little tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for use on occasional blemishes.  It clears them up over night!  If used regularly, it keeps them from forming in the first place.  I&#x27;ve used many acne products and none have performed like this one!</li>
            <li> Was given a sample from my skin care professional, and LOVE it! I experienced noticeable results after 24 hours. I have tried a lot of the prescriptions from dermatologists, and had little to no success. I will be keeping this in my daily skin care regimen for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with both regular and cystic acne. In the first week of using this I only noticed that my skin was softer, brighter, and more evenly colored. There was not much of a difference in acne other than less swelling. After two weeks my pores were much less clogged and my regular acne started diminishing. Also, the healing time for acne lessened and they stopped getting as large and inflamed. This WILL NOT get rid of cystic acne, but it certainly helps them heal and stops them from growing as large. I have been using this product for about a month now and my skin is clearer, scaring is going away, and my skin is slightly less oily. Another thing: this is a great makeup base. After a month of using this 3 times a day I have used about 1/3 of the tube. I tend to go overboard on application, especially on the cystic areas. Everything else I have tried irritates my sensitive skin including benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, sulfur, anything with alcohol in it, and even other salicylic acid products. This does not irritate my skin, in fact it calms it. I absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is probably the best acne cream that I have used. Very gentle, effective and it smells good! Definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> Somehow this face cream worsened my acne. I even stuck it out, finishing the entire tube, thinking my face was just adjusting and might come out better in the end. What a waste and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have weird skin that&#x27;s acne-prone and sensitive and reacts badly to anything even slightly comedogenic. Only 2 products have been able to keep my skin clear and happy...this Effaclar K and Dermalogica&#x27;s Oil Control Lotion. Effaclar K is great because it&#x27;s an everyday insurance policy againt zits, plus it has a slight exfoliating quality that over time will make one&#x27;s skin smoother.</li>
            <li> it works as it needs to be. just works not really fast, little by little, and i never feel hurt when i use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product in combination with other Biomedic products from LaRoche-Posay for the treatment of stubborn acne. I had trouble with moderate to severe acne for most of my 20s. I tried everything - accutane, 5 kinds of antibiotics, differin gel, ortho tri-cyclen + aldactone, stuff from tv, and oftentimes, I used several of the treatments in combination, as directed by my ever-hopeful dermatologist. Finally, I went to a plastic surgeon to see about some scar treatments, and before he did any major procedures, he put me on a combination of effaclar K, a couple of other biomedic products, Retin-A micro, and I had regular micro-dermabrasion and/or facial peel treatments. Retin-A Micro gave me really dry skin, so after I cut that out, everything else worked perfectly. I know other people&#x27;s recommendations can be annoying, especially when you&#x27;re certain that nothing will work, but I&#x27;d say that this product is worth a try! It really did help me. I continued to use it even after I stopped going to regular microdermabrasion appointments, and I have never had a reoccurence of acne. (As a side note, I also avoided major plastic surgery as a result of the success.)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have tried literally hundreds of beauty products from many countries and in every price range.  I&#x27;ve used cetaphil and creme de la mer... However, I can say that after two months of using this product it is the best thing I have found for my acne-prone skin.  As my dermatologist always emphasizes after I tell him I feel like I&#x27;m wasting my money, there is no such thing as a miracle.  He&#x27;s right, and I still get some breakouts, but this has helped- noticeably.      It also did not dry my skin the way all other acne products seem to do. I pair it with LRP&#x27;s toleriane moisturizer and I get no flakes at all, and almost no zits.  Best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for my acne; in my case better than prescription gels or antibiotics. My skin started getting better in a few days, but give it a try for at least 2-3 weeks since it takes some people longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I buy a new product, but what I got is a used one, I&#x27;mreally not happy about that. The cover has damaged and the product has been used, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old with a mild case of errupting acne.  I had tried several OTC medications for a topical, but after a month, I was frustrated.  I searched Amazon for another product and came across the La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Treament and decided to try it since so many others had positive results.    I too am a believer in this product.  The acne that I have is in the T areas of my face.  In just two days, errupting acne seemed to just disapear.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. After reading some of the positive reviews, I decided to waste $20+ on it to see if it will help. I used it on my mild acne for over a month and I didn&#x27;t notice the smallest change or effectiveness. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I had minimal acne all through high school but in my first year of college it really started to become noticeable. I tried different topical ointments from the dermatologist (such as differin), as well as oral antibiotics. Nothing made much of an impact and I disliked using all of them. Then I bought this because of all the positive reviews, and let me tell you, they&#x27;re right! It&#x27;s really gentle on my skin, smells nice, and in just the two days I&#x27;ve been using it I already notice a difference. I&#x27;m sure glad I got this instead of the more difficult and harsh kits that are also available online, though keep in mind my acne wasn&#x27;t severe.     I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product long ago.    It is the only thing I&#x27;ve actually rated 5-star on Amazon because I believe it rates it.    It reduces visible zits when applied directly to them- sometimes in just a couple of hours.    When applied to the whole face after a warm shower just before bed, you wake up with a clearer, cleaner, tighter face.  The acidity kills acne-causing bacteria on and below the surface of the skin, dissolving oily residue, preventing clogged pores, and eating away dead skin.    I found this product in Paris, and a few years later it started to be exported to the USA.  Until then, I was spending alot of money to purchase and ship it here into the USA where I live.  Now that it is available on Amazon.com, I&#x27;m so overwhelmed with happiness.    I cannot possibly say enough.  This stuff really is that good.  10/10!!!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny! You can use the spot treatment anywhere you have \\&quot;issues\\&quot;... it works extremely fast &amp; is not overly drying.</li>
            <li> I just received this La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment Fluid, when I open the package, I was surprised because the tube&#x27;s design is different from the picture. Then I used it, and know it is the same product, because it smells the same and feel the same as the one I used before which is exactly the same look as the pricture shows.    So I guess they changed design of the tube recently, I think Amazon should update the picture of this product.    according to my previous experience using this products, it should be good for acne. I hope it works this time, too.</li>
            <li> I bought La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment for my wife after reading reviews, hoping for results equal to the raves. She has rather aggressive acne on her face and back, especially under her neck line. However, after careful application for over a week, the effects were sadly opposite. The acne not only resisted the cream, it also appeared to encourage even more outbreak around areas treated. She immediately ceased to use it after noting the spreading, and the situation calmed down. She does supplement with DermaCare and internal cleaners that assist a great deal, along with diet to avoid chocolate, ice cream, caffeine and deep fried foods.  While this cream may indeed result in positive results for some users, I assure you, it is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 (ish) fair skinned woman, who&#x27;s always had acne prone skin. I&#x27;d only ever once found an inexpensive and worthy product that worked, then Bath &amp; Body Works decided to discontinue it (figures) about 10 years ago. Since, I&#x27;ve hunted for the next best thing, spending a small fortune in vain to simply clear up my face. It&#x27;s just on the chin and forehead, but still there no matter what I use (including proactiv). So I thought I&#x27;d try this line of products. Once again, I&#x27;ve been left disappointed as although this product softens the skin and pores it didn&#x27;t do anything about the acne.</li>
            <li> My 15-year-old grandson loves this product.   It clears up his skin quite nicely in a few days.  It&#x27;s not instant, but the zits start fading in a couple of days and then disappear.  We&#x27;ve tried all the major brands, but this works best for him.</li>
            <li> After just two days of using this product, I woke up and walked over to the bathroom to discover a baby-smooth, breakout-free face. I was ecstatic! I&#x27;ll update this review if any negative changes happen, but so far, I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products I use:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YMJJSK CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, 12 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002K8MK0I The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, 8.4-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002B649V2 TNS Essential Serum 28.4g/1oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002JL1Y6C Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Aczone&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000IO8JYM La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Acne Treatment Fluid (30ml) 1 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0074ENPWA Skin Medica Daily Physical Defense SPF 30, 3 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A 0.1% cream</li>
            <li> This product while not cheap it is not ridiculously expensive and works far better than other products that cost twice as much.  It won&#x27;t do miracles but if used correctly over time it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It works on acne-prone face very well. I used it as a moisturizer since it&#x27;s really light-weight and it is absorbed very well into your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really work on me.  Only use one time, I can feel that something different on my face.  I&#x27;ll recommand to my friends</li>
            <li> This is a medicine. Please dont buy without medical recommendation.   It worked fine for my type of skin</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried many products to treat my adult skin that breaks out (especially around the chin area).  I received this about two weeks ago, and have been using it only at night before I go to bed.  Typically, I find if I use a product like this twice a day my skin gets dry and flaky, so I limit to once a day.  I am so impressed with this product!  Instantly, my skin looks better - smoother, with the pores less visible.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I am hardly breaking out anymore.  Based on this I am going to buy another product from their line.</li>
            <li> I thought I try something new and ended up purchasing this product. I see no difference at all. The only thing pleasant was the smell, otherwise it was complete waste of money. For anyone interested in clearing their acne, I recommend purchasing the Panoxyl 10% BP cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I think this product deserves it! I moved to a very humid climate that my skin is not used to, and for the last year have suffered from horrible skin problems. Severe acne and uneven skin, sun damage, and unpredictable mood swings of either way too dry or way too oily skin. I tried literally all of the \\&quot;designer\\&quot; skin care kits, nothing made any difference, it just made my skin freak out even worse. I found this product and read the reviews, tried it, and am hooked! The first time I applied it, my face just felt better. My skin looks fresh and even, all the acne has cleared, and the redness from the really bad blemishes is fading more every day. It seems to heal anything on my face practically overnight. I do apply it very thick twice a day, and have not had any bothersome dryness as a result. I am just about to the point of wearing no foundation or concealer, and that is HUGE! I wish this came in a larger tube, I seem to go through a tube every 2 weeks, and while a tad spendy to buy that often, I am spending much less than when I was trying everything under the sun. Clear skin is very worth an investment of one key product that actually gives results. Might not work for everyone, but very much worth a try if there&#x27;s a chance you will have results like I did.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awesome.  I&#x27;ve had acne since childhood and tried this when I was in my mid 30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried many products including Proactiv.  I was introduced to this at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Adult acne is now gone.  I bought some for my kids (ages 14 &amp; 21) and their acne is gone.  This product doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and a small tube goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to use much.  Just a small dab.  It also works wonders for preventing razor bumps.  After shaving, apply this to the shaved area and no razor bumps.  My 21 yo loves it for acne and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product. Then about six months ago, La Roche Posay changed the formula. Now there is an \\&quot;anti-relapse\\&quot; ingredient which wasn&#x27;t there before. The whole consistency of the product has changed, the way it works changed, and when you begin using it, it no longer effectively spot treats acne. I used to be able to use this product and get results within a day! Now, if I use this product, my acne gets worse. I wish La Roche Posay was still offering their original formula, which was so effective and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I started breaking out with cystic acne for no apparent reason.  I&#x27;d get about 4 or 5 huge bumps on my jaws and along my chin.  Right around the time the bumps would almost be gone, which would take at least 2 weeks, I&#x27;d get 4-5 *new* huge bumps in different places on my face.  It was very frustrating, and I really needed something to deal with this issue.  So, I read the reviews here, and as they seemed very promising, I decided to give it a go.  Well, unfortunately, the product just didn&#x27;t work for me. Actually, it caused me to break out with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; pimples.  So I stopped using it.  The pimples went away, but of course I still had the cystic acne.  I really wanted this to work so I tried using it again.  And as before, I developed more acne than what I had before using it.  At that point, I just threw it away.  I&#x27;m glad it works for some but it did more harm than good for me.  I ended up going to a dermatologist and getting a couple of prescription creams for acne along with a medicated face wash, which did clear up my existing cystic acne and has so far stopped new acne from forming.  However, I would have much preferred to use this as opposed to expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I use this with the acne duo and redermic r and wow..My skin looks happy!. For once in my life my acne and blackheads are quiet without dryness, flakiness, itchiness, and oily sludge!  I,m 45 and I finally found products that work. Forget retin a and tazorac and duac. All expensive, drying, harsh. These work!!! I wish I found them years ago. Use the Azrec Secret as your mask. So affordable on Amazon too! Thank you Amazon for bringing such great products to us!</li>
            <li> This acne treatment works very well for my teenage daughter.  We have tried other products, but this seems to work the best and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed Effaclar K for my acne treatment. I assumed it has been working as expected, since he mentioned I will be using it for a while. I like that it&#x27;s not oily at all. So If you have oily skin, go for it. In addition, I&#x27;ve heard from a friend, it worked perfect for her acne problem too; now that she is done with her treatment, she is still using it everyday to reduce the little imperfections she may have left and the size of her pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad for me to give Effaclar K two stars. I started using this product in 2007, and it kept my face perfectly clear until 2011. It was a miracle product! I would get compliments on my clear skin all the time. Then, in the fall of 2011, they changed the formula to add an \\&quot;Anti Relapse\\&quot; ingredient. When I used the new formula, I got more blackheads and I started breaking out again. The consistency of the formula has changed, and it simply doesn&#x27;t work. I REALLY wish I could continue getting the old formula, and now I have to find a replacement for the product I used to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any suggestions for products that are similar to the old formula of Effaclar K, please let me know!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and acne free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as expected in good condition and with out expiration and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was going to help with my congested pores, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. It smells great, and I did see a reduction in my acne in general but it didn&#x27;t live up to all my expectations. Might be great if you have a milder case of acne or just a few spotty areas that need treatment.</li>
