            <li>It&#x27;s strong, but it works!</li>
            <li>I love the Nutri-Biotic products with Grapefruit Seed Extract because GSE has been the most effective thing for me for sore throats.</li>

            <li>After 2 days of use it feels better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use since the benefit is greater than the drawback</li>
            <li>(taste).&lt;br /&gt;If taste was better</li>
            <li>worked great in the New England flu season that just hit us.</li>
            <li>Best cure for dry throat.</li>
            <li>Nutribiotic Throat Spray is another great product that contains my old friend grapefruit seed extract (GSE).</li>
            <li>however you must know the taste is quite strong.  </li>
            <li>Did feel light headed after using this and discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately neither I nor my kids are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural, tastes great (not too strong like altoids or listerine or anything...just the perfect amount of flavorful, and more complex and interesting than simply &amp;#34;peppermint&amp;#34;.)</li>
            <li>i will re-rate it even higher after getting more feedback from my dad.</li>
            <li>Love the effects of Grapesead extract (very anti-fungal and anti microbial, therefore it works well...</li>
            <li>I believe it in so much, I have also used it in my children for their sore throats and it&#x27;s saved use more than one trip to the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I started using this and thought &#x27;not bad&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It would be mean not to recommend this awesome product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste very good and it can burn a sore throat a little, but it works!</li>
            <li>Overall, great natural product we use as an immune booster.</li>
            <li>I have been using this almost daily as it leaves a nice minty aftertaste...</li>
            <li>My own issue with it is that I get gastrointestinal pain if it reaches my stomach, so I can&#x27;t use it for long.</li>
            <li>GSE is a very potent and effective antimicrobial that works against quite a few different invasive agents.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>At the first sign of throat irritation, we use 1 or 2 sprays of the NutriBiotic First Aid Throat Spray.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it tasked better so that the kids would use it</li>
            <li>I like the refreshing taste and soothing feeling when I spray it to the back of my throat.</li>
            <li>Never really got the chance to see if this is effective because it caused me to have nausea.</li>
            <li>We cannot find it in local stores so we have to buy it online but are glad to do it.</li>
            <li>Not only is it so soothing, I believe it&#x27;s really helped keep me healthy as our throat is one of the first areas of defense for our immunity.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>Works good but am not able to find this product again</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t go full blown then this stuff is a definite success.</li>
            <li>I have become such a huge fan of Nutribiotic products, I swear by them.</li>
            <li>I spray this as much as needed until that sensation goes away.</li>
            <li>If sharing with more than one user, you just have to be careful not to allow them to touch it to their mouths, to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used this throat spray before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>without saying too much if you have ever had  a stroke or immune problems please take this...</li>
            <li>One flu in December of 2015 that I remember because it knocked me out for a couple of days but NO sore throat the whole time.</li>
            <li>NO soar throat the whole time.</li>
            <li>We have found that we have to use it immediately at the first sign and then use it once every few hours, but there have been many a time when we felt a sore throat or a stuffy nose coming on</li>
            <li>I find that is a very helpful  immune support supplement that is direct and gives fast results.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders but they seemed to recently changed their formula (it tastes different but better) and I am doubting its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be something I could use in the middle of the night when my throat is the most dry and sore.</li>
            <li>She is very sensitive to medicines &amp; chemicals and this throat spray has been a godsend</li>
            <li>Recently when fighting a sore throat this was very helpful.</li>
            <li>I happened to be by a natural food store and walked in.</li>
            <li>Beware if you&#x27;re sensitive to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old does it too.</li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>Whenever I start to get a scratchy throat, if I remember about this spray, I spray a few times and go to bed, and it&#x27;s either better or gone the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Give yourself an immunity boost,  long lasting fresh breath and throat relief with this spray.</li>
            <li>I kid you not when I say by the very next day, they pain had subsided considerably.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also loaded with natural immunity boosters such as zinc.</li>
            <li>I had tried other things that seemed promising to no avail.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I use it sparingly, only because too much zinc can interfere with other minerals in the body and that could be detrimental while breastfeesing.</li>
            <li>If we have a sore throat, chest tightness or pain or just feel like we are getting sick, we all use this spray and it works amazing!</li>

            <li> If we have a sore throat, chest tightness or pain or just feel like we are getting sick, we all use this spray and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;d alleviate something major by itself, but for minor irritations such as from dry air, sinus/allergy issues, it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I had enormous white spots in the back of my throat so painful that I couldn&#x27;t even swallow my own saliva.</li>
            <li> I thank my giant tonsils for that, but I do get other throat irritations, especially when dealing with colds and post-nasal drip.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or cause a numb feeling like some other sprays do, and it does make your breath smell nice.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil in this made me have mini-burps all night long.</li>
            <li> In the future, I would probably try other products to see if the grass is greener.</li>
            <li> I keep it by my night stand to use if a scratchy throat due to allergies wakes me in the middle of the night with a cough.  </li>
            <li> I have throat issues due to an extensive cervical surgery that caused severe acid reflux disease.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I feel like my throat is a scratchy from allergies, dry air, etc.</li>
            <li> I find my colds are usually less intense than they have been in the past.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it has an odd taste and after taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lead singer in a church band, and I have had problems with my vocals due to age and allergies causing dry throat.</li>
            <li> But when my throat/voice was feeling rough, this stuff, along with resting my voice when I could, truly did the trick.</li>
            <li> I know this is a harsh bug I have because my kids have been suffering with it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff healed my throat years ago due to talking excessively on phone all day at work, combined with the constant heating over the long winters.</li>
            <li> I had the beginning of a viral infection which made my throat extremely sore.</li>
            <li> I have had several sore throats this winter which usually lead to sickness</li>
            <li> otherwise she would be coughing all night long and crying her throat hurts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want the pharmaceutical company nor any other company raising the price on this item because it does more that cure the common cold.</li>
            <li> It really helps numb throat pain in the short term, while also helping you heal!</li>
            <li> and and we can keep ourselves from coming down with it.  </li>
            <li> or you feel you&#x27;re coming down with tonsillitis, this spray is soothing, stops the hurt, stops the tickle and the phelgm.</li>
            <li> If we feel like we might be getting a cold we use this spray right away</li>
            <li> but I no full blown colds that I can remember.</li>
            <li> but I no full blown colds that I can remember.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and wanted a natural throat spray alternative to the disgusting drugstore one.</li>
            <li> I often have trouble sleeping at night due to coughing; I just spray a small amount and it relieves the tickle in my throat and lets me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> A spoonful of honey couldn&#x27;t help this go down!</li>
            <li> I have not had the flu or a cold this whole year , I spray my throat every nite when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> and I swear it stops the ailment dead in it&#x27;s tracks.  </li>
            <li> This may be effective but it tastes so awful that I almost threw up.</li>
            <li> When your throat is raw from coughing or you get that seasonal tickle in the throat</li>
            <li> This was so uncomfortable and felt like I had gas in my throat the entire night.</li>
            <li> That usually takes care of whatever was trying to cause problems.</li>
            <li> As a mom of an 8 month old who doesn&#x27;t sleep, when I catch a cold</li>
            <li> Usually I would reach for the GSE</li>
            <li> Once we are sick it seems that this helps shorten the duration of our colds, and it has a very analgesic effect on a soar throat too.  </li>
            <li> I can not handle taking Zinc vitamins, for some reason the make me violently ill (nausea, stomach cramping, dry heaves etc...)</li>
            <li> Use it regularly through cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> Really works to control that annoying allergy throat tickle.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a slight cold and no sore throat.</li>
            <li> Last summer, I came down with a viral throat infection so horrifyingly awful that strep would have been a welcomed relief.</li>
            <li> Got me thru some tough days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this until now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works very well! Product we will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Did feel light headed after using this and discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by nutribiotic now and I&#x27;m shocked they stand behind this</li>
            <li> ordered 2.  1 for me and one for my dad who has been having throat and immune system issues for a while.  does the job for me.  i will re-rate it even higher after getting more feedback from my dad.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and wanted a natural throat spray alternative to the disgusting drugstore one. I had the beginning of a viral infection which made my throat extremely sore. I started using this and thought &#x27;not bad&#x27;. Until I went to bed. The peppermint oil in this made me have mini-burps all night long. This was so uncomfortable and felt like I had gas in my throat the entire night. A friend had told me that peppermint can relax the stomach muscles and cause you to burp uncontrollably. I&#x27;ve never experienced this until now. I was hoping this would be something I could use in the middle of the night when my throat is the most dry and sore. Besides the burping problem, this is alright. Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad and is soothing. In the future, I would probably try other products to see if the grass is greener.</li>
            <li> Mrs. Raster: This stuff healed my throat years ago due to talking excessively on phone all day at work, combined with the constant heating over the long winters. I had tried other things that seemed promising to no avail. This stuff is all natural, tastes great (not too strong like altoids or listerine or anything...just the perfect amount of flavorful, and more complex and interesting than simply &amp;#34;peppermint&amp;#34;.) and is a very good value. It is a great breath freshener which is what I use it for now. But when my throat/voice was feeling rough, this stuff, along with resting my voice when I could, truly did the trick. At that time it was helpful to keep one at home, and one at work, so that I could use it the max. 3 times per day, at the longest intervals.</li>
            <li> At the first sign of throat irritation, we use 1 or 2 sprays of the NutriBiotic First Aid Throat Spray. That usually takes care of whatever was trying to cause problems. I recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li> I have had several sore throats this winter which usually lead to sickness but this seems to have helped.  Have not had a cold yet (knock, knock on wood).</li>
            <li> As a mom of an 8 month old who doesn&#x27;t sleep, when I catch a cold it winds up hanging around for a while. I use this throat spray (sparingly, though I haven&#x27;t had any weird reactions even when used as directed) when I start feeling any signs of a cold. I often have trouble sleeping at night due to coughing; I just spray a small amount and it relieves the tickle in my throat and lets me fall asleep. I find my colds are usually less intense than they have been in the past. Like I said, I use it sparingly, only because too much zinc can interfere with other minerals in the body and that could be detrimental while breastfeesing. Overall, great natural product we use as an immune booster.</li>
            <li> Really works to control that annoying allergy throat tickle.</li>
            <li> Works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> Love the effects of Grapesead extract (very anti-fungal and anti microbial, therefore it works well... however you must know the taste is quite strong.  It will do the job, but be prepared for a strong taste!</li>
            <li> worked great in the New England flu season that just hit us. Got me thru some tough days.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Anytime I start to feel a tingle in my throat I spray this as much as needed until that sensation goes away. I find that is a very helpful  immune support supplement that is direct and gives fast results. I would for sure recommend this to anyone! It is also just a great product to have on hand. I honestly found that this worked better than sovereign silver. Another great fact is that it tastes good too! Does not have a bad taste when you spray it your mouth. Go ahead and buy it if you are considering it!</li>
            <li> Nutribiotic Throat Spray is another great product that contains my old friend grapefruit seed extract (GSE). GSE is a very potent and effective antimicrobial that works against quite a few different invasive agents. I do not get strep throat... I thank my giant tonsils for that, but I do get other throat irritations, especially when dealing with colds and post-nasal drip. This spray has helped cut my throat irritation and helped heal my colds quicker, too. I believe it in so much, I have also used it in my children for their sore throats and it&#x27;s saved use more than one trip to the doctor&#x27;s office. If sharing with more than one user, you just have to be careful not to allow them to touch it to their mouths, to avoid cross-contamination. It doesn&#x27;t taste very good and it can burn a sore throat a little, but it works!</li>
            <li> Best cure for dry throat. I&#x27;m a lead singer in a church band, and I have had problems with my vocals due to age and allergies causing dry throat. This spray is amazing I use it every Sunday before I sing, and also haven&#x27;t had a cold in almost a year. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Recently when fighting a sore throat this was very helpful. I combined this with olive leaf and oregano and it knocked it out.</li>
            <li> Great preventive spray to keep you healthy!  I am a nurse and use this every day to keep the germs away!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this stuff.  If we feel like we might be getting a cold we use this spray right away and and we can keep ourselves from coming down with it.  We have found that we have to use it immediately at the first sign and then use it once every few hours, but there have been many a time when we felt a sore throat or a stuffy nose coming on and we used this and the soar throat went away, the nose cleared up, and we didn&#x27;t get sick.  Once we are sick it seems that this helps shorten the duration of our colds, and it has a very analgesic effect on a soar throat too.  My only wish is that it tasked better so that the kids would use it</li>
            <li> I have never put my children on antibiotics, nor ever hope to! When they have a sore or scratchy throat, we get out the throat spray and within a day or two, it is gone. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years now.  I consider it a &amp;#34;healthy mouth&amp;#34; spray, rather than a sore throat spray.  If I am feeling a cold come on or allergies, I start using this a couple times a day and I swear it stops the ailment dead in it&#x27;s tracks.  I feel like it helps keep my mouth and throat healthy too.</li>
            <li> I have used this throat spray before and really like it.  I keep it by my night stand to use if a scratchy throat due to allergies wakes me in the middle of the night with a cough.  I feel it works much better than a brand you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I can not handle taking Zinc vitamins, for some reason the make me violently ill (nausea, stomach cramping, dry heaves etc...) I started to feel like a sore throat was impending and ordered this as an alternative to zinc pills. It arrived just in time to help me fight off the sick germs.. I have been using this almost daily as it leaves a nice minty aftertaste...</li>
            <li> Ive been sitting at this computer typing and erasing everything  I wrote. I don&#x27;t want the pharmaceutical company nor any other company raising the price on this item because it does more that cure the common cold. without saying too much if you have ever had  a stroke or immune problems please take this...If you develop nausea or something miner reduce the dosage but don&#x27;t stop taking this product...</li>
            <li> My kids like this spray. It doesn&#x27;t burn or cause a numb feeling like some other sprays do, and it does make your breath smell nice.</li>
            <li> It would be mean not to recommend this awesome product. Use it regularly through cold and flu season. Tastes great!</li>
            <li> This works. Every member of my family has one.</li>
            <li> Works good but am not able to find this product again</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff... bought 2 bottles.  helped my Son with a sore throat and my husband with allergies.</li>
            <li> For sore throats the spray works well. My son also used it, and he recommends it to his business clients.  However...I need to add:  grapefruit seed extract can raise blood pressure and has caused heart fluttering for a friend of mine when she took it internally, so once you sprayed, don&#x27;t swallow, but spit it out. My own issue with it is that I get gastrointestinal pain if it reaches my stomach, so I can&#x27;t use it for long.</li>
            <li> Love this combo of illness-fighting ingredients. It really helps numb throat pain in the short term, while also helping you heal!</li>
            <li> Last summer, I came down with a viral throat infection so horrifyingly awful that strep would have been a welcomed relief. I had enormous white spots in the back of my throat so painful that I couldn&#x27;t even swallow my own saliva. After about 4 days of not being able to swallow let alone eat, I went to the doctor who comfirmed it was viral and not strep so there was nothing she could do. I begged for some sort of pain relief. She prescribed a topical anesthetic liquid that tasted so nasty it would make me vomit. By about the 8th day, I had lost about 6 lbs and I was at my wits end. I happened to be by a natural food store and walked in. Out of curiosity I asked if they had anything for a throat infection. The clerk pointed to the nutribiotic throat spay and said it was antibacterial, antiviral and anti fungal. Music to my ears. I had nothing to lose so I bought and gave it a try as soon as I got to my car in the parking lot. I kid you not when I say by the very next day, they pain had subsided considerably. I kept using the spray and by the third day of using it, my throat infection was all but gone. This stuff saved me from starving to death!! I am forever grateful that the clerk pointed me in the direction of this spray. I&#x27;ve had colds and one flu since and even though I&#x27;ve had coughs and congestion, I have yet to get another sore throat. Beware if you&#x27;re sensitive to any of the ingredients. Fortunately neither I nor my kids are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Update 08/2015*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since writing this review, I have gotten a couple of colds. I had the beginnings of a sore throat each time but I kept using the spray. I ended up with a slight cold and no sore throat. I can say the same for my kids, they have gotten colds but have yet to complain of a sore throat. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******update 3/14/17*******&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost three years since I started using this stuff and I STILL haven&#x27;t gotten a sore throat. One flu in December of 2015 that I remember because it knocked me out for a couple of days but NO sore throat the whole time. I get the occasional sniffles but I no full blown colds that I can remember. I cannot recommend this stuff enough!because it knocked me out for a couple of days but NO soar throat the whole time. I get the occasional sniffles but I no full blown colds that I can remember. I cannot recommend this stuff enough!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the positive feedback. I have throat issues due to an extensive cervical surgery that caused severe acid reflux disease. The medication that I take daily takes the symptoms away but does not stop the inflammation of my esophagus which causes a sore throat. This product helps relieve the pain temporarily and my throat seems to be getting better. I am having an endoscopy soon and will know more when those results are in. I like the refreshing taste and soothing feeling when I spray it to the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> Never really got the chance to see if this is effective because it caused me to have nausea. I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch  or something else. Anyway the refund went well.</li>
            <li> I have used GSE for years and always used it for that infrequent bout of bronchitis. It worked wonders but they seemed to recently changed their formula (it tastes different but better) and I am doubting its effectiveness. I bought this spray some time ago and it was sitting on my shelf for several months. Today I started feeling the beginning of that bronchitis tickle and phlegm. Usually I would reach for the GSE but this time I used the spray. It seems to be working. It immediately broke up the phlegm and it seemed to quell the tickle and cough urge.  I am hoping that it will nip this thing in the bud. If it doesn&#x27;t go full blown then this stuff is a definite success. I know this is a harsh bug I have because my kids have been suffering with it for several weeks. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think they can handle this spray as they are averse even to mint toothpaste. I will continue to use it and will update with results.</li>
            <li> best throat spray ever.  if a sore throat or cold is heading my way, I begin to spray my throat with this spray.. Usually the cold never materializes, or it is shorter and not as severe as it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I&#x27;ve told all my colleagues about this spray and how well it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, but it works! So glad I found this, and even more glad with the price. Works better for me than the therabreath products I have used.</li>
            <li> This may be effective but it tastes so awful that I almost threw up. Tried hiding it in OJ concentrate like the GSE drops but it&#x27;s still horrific. A spoonful of honey couldn&#x27;t help this go down!</li>
            <li> Seems to work great!  Whenever I start to get a scratchy throat, if I remember about this spray, I spray a few times and go to bed, and it&#x27;s either better or gone the next morning.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;d alleviate something major by itself, but for minor irritations such as from dry air, sinus/allergy issues, it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I feel like my throat is a scratchy from allergies, dry air, etc. It is soothing and the flavor isn&#x27;t bad. I love the Nutri-Biotic products with Grapefruit Seed Extract because GSE has been the most effective thing for me for sore throats. The spray makes using GSE on the throat convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> I have not had the flu or a cold this whole year , I spray my throat every nite when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Used on my seasonal allergy sore throat. After 2 days of use it feels better. The only problem is that it has an odd taste and after taste. But on the 2nd day I was used to it. I will continue to use since the benefit is greater than the drawback (taste).&lt;br /&gt;If taste was better it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I have become such a huge fan of Nutribiotic products, I swear by them. This throat spray is ideal for anyone with a tired/ sore/ prone to strain in their throat. It&#x27;s also loaded with natural immunity boosters such as zinc. Not only is it so soothing, I believe it&#x27;s really helped keep me healthy as our throat is one of the first areas of defense for our immunity. Give yourself an immunity boost,  long lasting fresh breath and throat relief with this spray.</li>
            <li> Works perfect when you feel a sore throat coming on for any reason.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this spray for 8+ years and we could never find anything that even compares. When your throat is raw from coughing or you get that seasonal tickle in the throat or you feel you&#x27;re coming down with tonsillitis, this spray is soothing, stops the hurt, stops the tickle and the phelgm. Our young daughter has terrible allergies and asks specifically for it when she feels a sore throat coming on. She is very sensitive to medicines &amp; chemicals and this throat spray has been a godsend otherwise she would be coughing all night long and crying her throat hurts. We cannot find it in local stores so we have to buy it online but are glad to do it.</li>
            <li> We use this all the time.  If we have a sore throat, chest tightness or pain or just feel like we are getting sick, we all use this spray and it works amazing! I ALWAYS take it on a trip just in case someone feels like they are getting sick.  My 4 yr old does it too. Tastes like peppermint but doesn&#x27;t bother her a bit.</li>
            <li> makes my mouth smell really good lol</li>
            <li> I had a itch problem after okra picking. Used this throat spray that has helped a lot. I sprayed it everywhere I had bumps on this useless body. Seems to give a 5+ hour relief and the bumps on the useless body goes away after some time... I get a burning sensation sometimes but I spray a lot. No problems so far. I hope this dam itch goes away soon.</li>
            <li> This purchase was for my mother and she swears by the stuff. This was by far the best price I have been able to find it.</li>
