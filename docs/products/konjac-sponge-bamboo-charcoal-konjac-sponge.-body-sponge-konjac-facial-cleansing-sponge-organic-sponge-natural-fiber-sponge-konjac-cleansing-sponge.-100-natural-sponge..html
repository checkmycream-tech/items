            <li>Very easy to use when cleaning  body.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I will wear out stuff faster than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not 100% sure that I can justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin and really exfoliates well.  </li>
            <li>So much better for your skin than most scrubs.  </li>
            <li>My girl stole it and I have to buy another one :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS THING AFTER 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>this feels like it was rubbing it in more.</li>
            <li>Maybe will be better for face.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have a hook where you store the sponge because it drys out after every use.</li>
            <li>better thickness and weight seemed like it would be easier to handle and have better value.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the material is made out of.  </li>
            <li>Very soft sponge great for getting rid of blackheads on the face.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve found the perfect balance between strong and soft that gets exfoliation just right.</li>
            <li>Love the Bonus Free beauty e-book.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell that the charcoal is doing anything good for my skin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly dense sponge but doesn&#x27;t hold liquid bath soap very well.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Works great and it does leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The sponge was VERY soft and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m just more aggressive at scrubbing</li>
            <li>Fine product, as described.</li>
            <li>probably best on face, but not full body.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s got a nice texture and feels very durable.</li>
            <li>Great... definitely would buy it again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and comfortable on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its a great starting point, but needs some improvement.</li>
            <li>I entered it in the Guines world book of records and they were amazed, they said nothing on earth would ever come close to beating this record of being so cheap.</li>
            <li>It feels great to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re dragging sand paper across your skin like most other loofahs/sponges.</li>
            <li>I use handmade bar soap that lathers amazingly (because I make it :) and it pretty much washed an arm...</li>
            <li>Weasel words like &amp;#34;it neutralizes acidic substances on the skin through the rich layers of water embedded within the sponge&amp;#34; should make you skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Konjac sponges to clean my face for a while now.</li>
            <li>I feel that my skin so clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>This sponge will give you a good 5 months of use if you use it daily.</li>
            <li>This sponge is much thicker, and the contours seem like they&#x27;re able to hold liquid soap a bit better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the huge cystic pimples have turned into the smaller, under the skin kind that aren&#x27;t as noticeable but that I can still feel.  </li>
            <li>Seems like the product was originally intended for washing one&#x27;s face which might be just right.  </li>
            <li>it answered my durability issue that I&#x27;ve experienced previously with the plastic ribbon that is wadded up and stapled together to be &amp;#34;loofah-like&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>Love it for my soft part</li>
            <li>Lathers up well and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Years and years of looking for the right loofa/sponge</li>
            <li>I paid more than 12 bucks for a sponge that does the exact same thing as most other cheap sponges/luffas.</li>
            <li>They are large enough to use as a body sponge and provide a nice gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to break within the first week of using the sponge</li>
            <li>After about 4 1/2 months, mine is pretty shot but can be used until I decide not to.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and economical</li>
            <li>Stays pretty intact.</li>
            <li>When I received this sponge, I was excited that it was better than the other tear-drop shaped Konjac sponges I had tried.</li>
            <li>*** might aswelll use hands,a typical kitchen sponge will probably clean you better than this s</li>
            <li>I prefer a sponge that feels like it is gently exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>It works even better than expected.</li>
            <li>Needed something a bit more rough.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and is non-abrasive.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and go straight for the charcoal pill or the powder.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I think the Chinese are paying them to use it, it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>myself, I like these a lot more than other options I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I love how they very gently slough off makeup and dead skin.</li>
            <li>I use the same bar of soap but using this sponge with it leaves my skin VERY smooth, not dry</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something that actually SCRUBBED you clean.  </li>
            <li>I got a tiny little rock that turns into nothing more than a durable smooth dish washing sponge.</li>
            <li>It takes very little soap to get nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a decent body washing loofah like sponge.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really hard at first, but when you follow the instructions it becomes this super soft yet strong body sponge.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a little more stiff/rough.  </li>
            <li>It did not do anything a normal sponge wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to deal with the older plastic ones coming unstapled and being a complete pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if the cost justifies the better quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a few minutes in warm water and its soft and bigger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty smooth and although my face does feel clean, I&#x27;m not sure it has really gotten down enough to &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rip apart, it&#x27;s easy to squeeze the soap, it&#x27;s also soft and rough at the same time and does the job.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Gets incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Too soft to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I like the not fluffy part a</li>
            <li>Too soft for body.</li>
            <li>course, the claims made in this listing are completely bunk.</li>
            <li>again, nice feeling just not good for actual washing</li>
            <li>He has some pretty rough skin and loves it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Structurally holding up so far, but is hung by only a cotton string.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also too soft for my taste (but that&#x27;s a personal preference).</li>
            <li>Once she soaked them for a minute and actually used it, she was completely sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>But after only a week of use, the sponge completely disintegrated.</li>
            <li>I always used sponges but the cheap ones always seemed to get so dirty looking to quick.</li>
            <li>The sponge arrives rather shriveled and crunchy and takes a little longer than expected to \\&quot;revive\\&quot; with water, but the instructions are accurate.</li>
            <li>Really neat product and seems durable enough to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It arrives hard but softens quickly with water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have previously used plastic loofah-like &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34; and they worked really well for her</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint, again, is that it&#x27;s just way too soft and has no ability to really exfoliate my skin.</li>

            <li> course, the claims made in this listing are completely bunk.</li>
            <li> again, nice feeling just not good for actual washing</li>
            <li> He has some pretty rough skin and loves it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Structurally holding up so far, but is hung by only a cotton string.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too soft for my taste (but that&#x27;s a personal preference).</li>

            <li> Once with a natural scrub and other with a regular cleanser</li>

            <li> Not just regular acne, but the HUGE, red, under the skin, painful, cystic pimples that would appear on my chin almost daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll likely justify the cost by the loss of irritation and frustration I feel by using other stuff.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed :(&lt;br /&gt;Would have been a great sponge, but is absolutely disposable, I tried 4 of them, they all fell apart after 4-5th use!</li>

            <li> Very small and not worth the price!</li>
            <li> When you take it out after receiving it you might think like I did that it is so small and hard.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Underwhelming.  Not sure what I was expecting, but this sponge is nothing too exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something other than a poof to use (keep tearing apart) but this is really too small and lacks roughness for scrubbing.  Seems like the product was originally intended for washing one&#x27;s face which might be just right.  Falls short for washing the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structurally holding up so far, but is hung by only a cotton string.  Not expecting that to last too long.</li>
            <li> Very soft sponge great for getting rid of blackheads on the face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in October of 2014. Upon first opening the charcoal sponge I noticed the string was very thin. I was expecting it to break within the first week of using the sponge but it still hasn&#x27;t broken. The sponge was VERY soft and pleasant to use. About a month ago the sponge started to tear in half and started coming apart bit by bit. I am now cleaning up sponge pieces in the shower after each use. This sponge will give you a good 5 months of use if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge for my teenage son.  He has been using it every day and likes the way his face feels.</li>
            <li> Hard To make it soft is too big for face</li>
            <li> OMG! can&#x27;t believe it is that good! will never shower without it !</li>
            <li> this sponge feels great like all the konjac sponges but if you plan on using it with soap you better plan on using lots of soap! I use handmade bar soap that lathers amazingly (because I make it :) and it pretty much washed an arm...lather again, the other arm...you get the idea. can&#x27;t really tell that the charcoal is doing anything good for my skin...don&#x27;t feel or see a difference or anything. again, nice feeling just not good for actual washing and I won&#x27;t be paying extra for charcoal additive again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t exfoliate and feels slimy</li>
            <li> This sponge is smaller than I would like, but I have used it for over two weeks and it has improved the dry condition of my skin. I use the same bar of soap but using this sponge with it leaves my skin VERY smooth, not dry and I feel cleaner. I don&#x27;t know how it works but I use it to scrub my neck down to my knees and my whole body feels normal without the usual tight, dry looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> Very small and not worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very angry! !!!! Sponge was in pieces when recieved.  I was never able to use.</li>
            <li> Really neat product and seems durable enough to last a long time.  I used to have a problem with loofah&#x27;s getting moldy, but I don&#x27;t anticipate that will be a problem with this sponge!  It is a little small for my liking, but it is very easily softened with a little water and hardens up until the next use.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised when I opened the package. The sponge arrives rather shriveled and crunchy and takes a little longer than expected to \\&quot;revive\\&quot; with water, but the instructions are accurate. After that it&#x27;s got a nice texture and feels very durable. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a feminine appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Konjac sponges to clean my face for a while now. I love how they very gently slough off makeup and dead skin. They are gentle enough for everyday use. This particular brand however is the best quality. Definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This sponge beats anything I have every used for bathing.  Leaves your skin refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love it for my soft part</li>
            <li> Notice reduced blackheads and small imperfections within 3 days. Also produced softer looking skin with washing 2 times per day. Once with a natural scrub and other with a regular cleanser</li>
            <li> This bath sponge does its purpose, but that&#x27;s about all I can say. It&#x27;s quite small and needs some time under the water before you can use it. It&#x27;s also too soft for my taste (but that&#x27;s a personal preference). I prefer a sponge that feels like it is gently exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!  They are large enough to use as a body sponge and provide a nice gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  It works even better than expected.</li>
            <li> My son raves about how good this cleans.. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought three of these for the wife and I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have previously used plastic loofah-like &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34; and they worked really well for her but I tend to end up with them falling apart in a matter of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try something different and, after researching a lot, I stumbled across these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was initially skeptical, which makes total sense as they ship dry and hard. Once she soaked them for a minute and actually used it, she was completely sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has it answered my durability issue that I&#x27;ve experienced previously with the plastic ribbon that is wadded up and stapled together to be &amp;#34;loofah-like&amp;#34;? Kinda. After about 4 1/2 months, mine is pretty shot but can be used until I decide not to. The wife&#x27;s is still doing well. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m just more aggressive at scrubbing and I will wear out stuff faster than most. I do like that I don&#x27;t have to deal with the older plastic ones coming unstapled and being a complete pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much more expensive so I&#x27;m not sure if the cost justifies the better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my wife, they are amazing. The can remove makeup without the use of makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I like these a lot more than other options I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m just not 100% sure that I can justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll likely justify the cost by the loss of irritation and frustration I feel by using other stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. Lathers up well and just the right size. When you take it out after receiving it you might think like I did that it is so small and hard. Just a few minutes in warm water and its soft and bigger. I always used sponges but the cheap ones always seemed to get so dirty looking to quick.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do a ton for me.</li>
            <li> I paid more than 12 bucks for a sponge that does the exact same thing as most other cheap sponges/luffas. I feel like a dumba$$</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a little more stiff/rough.  It&#x27;s pretty smooth and although my face does feel clean, I&#x27;m not sure it has really gotten down enough to &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to use.  He has some pretty rough skin and loves it!  Thank you de prettilicious!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a decent body washing loofah like sponge. I got a tiny little rock that turns into nothing more than a durable smooth dish washing sponge. Gets incredibly soft. Too soft to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Ripped after three uses</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with acne until I was in my late 20s.  Not just regular acne, but the HUGE, red, under the skin, painful, cystic pimples that would appear on my chin almost daily.  I&#x27;d wake up everyday and go straight to the mirror to examine my face to see what I was going to have to deal with.  It was humiliating and it lasted into my mid 30s and left dark, ugly scars.  Now that I&#x27;m in my late 30s the huge cystic pimples have turned into the smaller, under the skin kind that aren&#x27;t as noticeable but that I can still feel.  I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for around two months now and have seen a drastic improvement in the tone, texture, and overall appearance of my chin.  I have a teenage son who was starting to break out and ordered him one as well.  I don&#x27;t give a lot of 5 star reviews but this sponge definitely deserves one.</li>
            <li> This product is something I would not likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got to listen to the other reviews to purchase this!!!! I usually use the hammam and of this having the same exfoliating power. Oh boy! It&#x27;s like a slippery gum when wet</li>
            <li> Needed something a bit more rough.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> very sturdy and economical</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin and really exfoliates well.  I got the big size, but wish it was bigger.  The big size needs to be at least 50% bigger if you&#x27;re going to use it on your whole body.</li>
            <li> on time...as expected...product ++++</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  It gently exfoliates and is non-abrasive.  So much better for your skin than most scrubs.  I saw IMMEDIATE results after using this great product.  My skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, needed a sponge, not a luuufffffaaaa thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good?  It is awesome in ways that I will not describe because I am a guy.  I like the not fluffy part a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad?  My girl stole it and I have to buy another one :)</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fine product, as described.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING AFTER 2 WEEKS. It doesn&#x27;t rip apart, it&#x27;s easy to squeeze the soap, it&#x27;s also soft and rough at the same time and does the job. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Save your money and go straight for the charcoal pill or the powder.</li>
            <li> Great item to clean your face, but fell apart to soon!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be. Just a small scrubbing sponge. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> dosent scurb for s*** might aswelll use hands,a typical kitchen sponge will probably clean you better than this s***</li>
            <li> Not as rough as I thought it would be. When its wet, it fells almost the same as a wet dish sponge. Not very exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body sponges I&#x27;ve come across. Years and years of looking for the right loofa/sponge and I think this may have ended that search. It&#x27;s a small sponge (fits well in your hands) that&#x27;s really hard at first, but when you follow the instructions it becomes this super soft yet strong body sponge. It feels great to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re dragging sand paper across your skin like most other loofahs/sponges. They&#x27;ve found the perfect balance between strong and soft that gets exfoliation just right.</li>
            <li> It work great on my skin. I feel that my skin so clean. It is soft enough to not irritate my skin yet rough enough to exfoliate the my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(&lt;br /&gt;Would have been a great sponge, but is absolutely disposable, I tried 4 of them, they all fell apart after 4-5th use!</li>
            <li> Love the size. Stays pretty intact. Good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing sponge! Great exfoliant Works Great... definitely would buy it again!</li>
            <li> i need something that will scrub dead skin and dirty off. this feels like it was rubbing it in more. probably best on face, but not full body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this bath sponge. It is far too soft and I&#x27;m not sure how it can claim to be exfoliating. It arrives hard but softens quickly with water. It&#x27;s a fairly dense sponge but doesn&#x27;t hold liquid bath soap very well. It takes awhile to get it to form good suds. The softness of it also makes it hard to hold and use. Maybe if it was a little bigger it would be easier to hold. My biggest complaint, again, is that it&#x27;s just way too soft and has no ability to really exfoliate my skin. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Good product. It helps to cleanse and exfoliates skin. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Too soft for body. Maybe will be better for face.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this and it clears up his skin nicely.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face and body feels amazing when using the sponges.  It takes very little soap to get nice and sudsy. The sponges don&#x27;t take long at all to become moist!  Great investment.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Make sure that you have a hook where you store the sponge because it drys out after every use.</li>
            <li> Slimy memory foam is what this sponge is like. It did not do anything a normal sponge wouldn&#x27;t do. I think this is just a gimmick. I&#x27;m returning mine</li>
            <li> When I received this sponge, I was excited that it was better than the other tear-drop shaped Konjac sponges I had tried. This sponge is much thicker, and the contours seem like they&#x27;re able to hold liquid soap a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The better thickness and weight seemed like it would be easier to handle and have better value.  But after only a week of use, the sponge completely disintegrated. For the price, I expected it to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the claims made in this listing are completely bunk. The sponge does nothing for metabolic rate, and doesn&#x27;t change the pH of the user&#x27;s skin. The manufacturer has no basis for these claims. Weasel words like &amp;#34;it neutralizes acidic substances on the skin through the rich layers of water embedded within the sponge&amp;#34; should make you skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the material is made out of.  It&#x27;s durable and comfortable on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and very difficult to find a comfortable way to grip it.&lt;br /&gt;The string on it seems very thin and flimsy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and I&#x27;m expecting the string to give out any day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it looks great and the material is awesome.  I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again though.  I would buy it again if the made it a bit bigger, and/or made it so it can be worn like a glove. its a great starting point, but needs some improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great and it does leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Perfect texture for cleansing both face and body. I saw the result after 2 weeks of use. Very nice seller. Fast shipping. Love the Bonus Free beauty e-book.</li>
            <li> Very different from your usual bath scrubber, but I really like it, Can use it with or without soap, once it&#x27;s wet it softens into a very&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant experience,.I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than a month and it is already ripping. And they use the cheapest made in china string that is known to mankind. I think the Chinese are paying them to use it, it is so cheap. I entered it in the Guines world book of records and they were amazed, they said nothing on earth would ever come close to beating this record of being so cheap.</li>
            <li> Didnt expect it to be so small</li>
            <li> I work a tough job so I was looking for something that actually SCRUBBED you clean.  This thing is small and way too soft.  Definitely for a woman</li>
            <li> This sponge suds up nice with liquid soap.  Very easy to use when cleaning  body.  I haven&#x27;t had a problems.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    </ol>
