            <li>very nice invention but still prefer the comb over this brush</li>
            <li>Not the best brush for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and she went and bought her own!</li>
            <li>and I thought the concept was good</li>
            <li>this is still good.</li>

            <li>Love how it&#x27;s slotted to get that airflow in their!</li>
            <li>This brush is so perfect &amp; Fast.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair look any better.  </li>
            <li>it glides better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>and I used this and another magic ingredient: Crisco.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>okay not like that</li>
            <li>I love the boar bristle on this product.</li>
            <li>I like the more plastic-ky kind.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>, the bristles are nice and thick great to put shine into anyone&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>I was fine, but it did pull out my hair along my front temple.</li>
            <li>*also try best to not clamp brush tightly onto hair, lest you want to pull  hair out.</li>
            <li>It works great, still getting used to it for the back of my hair</li>
            <li>But overall Great product.</li>
            <li>Genuine ceramic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product because it distributes all of the heat protectant spray/serum while you are using a blow dryer or a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have very very curly latino hair, so for a brush to be able to pull this off is a miracle.</li>
            <li>I originally saw one on Folica.com for about $15.00</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for its high quality and durability, if you are someone like me who needs this kind of brush, this is the one to get!</li>
            <li>When I used a round brush and blow dryer, my hair remained incredibly poofy...</li>
            <li>This brush itself is not bad, but a screw popped out the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It also has a lock on the bottom of the brush to stop it from opening and easy storage and when ready to use push lock out and voila.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!</li>
            <li>I usually do not recommend anything, but this I love.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really hard which is good for gripping purposes</li>
            <li>This is kind of a hassle to use, I have only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>So impressed, very sturdy use it on clients that have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>This thing broke right out of the package and wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of shipping to return.</li>
            <li>I lose a ton of hair when I use this...pulls it right out of my head.</li>
            <li>no other :)</li>
            <li>Broke right after I received it better off purchasing the actual Denman straightener brush for $13</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get one of these brushes ever since I saw my first review about it on Youtube.</li>
            <li>If only I had one more hand...</li>
            <li>I so love this brush not only does it work with a blow dryer</li>
            <li>First I realized that you had to use a hair dryer too, which was a pain.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>brush bristles fell-out of the brush during the first time i triad it .. and the remaining bristles melted int my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush once you realize that you need to allow the blow dryer to sit for a few seconds before moving upwards.</li>
            <li>I love this brush it help flaten my hair with my flat iron</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and really does straighten curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very rough and every time that I used it, it made my hair incredibly frizzy and not straight.</li>
            <li>This really gets the hair straight without a whole bunch of heat transfer to your hair.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair really straight and silky.</li>
            <li>Everyone always ask me how I get it so straight.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>It does really straighten the hair.</li>
            <li>but it does straighten it very well..</li>
            <li>but now they are just as straight as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>Really made the process easier.</li>
            <li>If it work for me it will work for any one else even for my straight hair people</li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for years and this brush makes its so much easier.</li>
            <li>and I have really curl hair.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It straightens my natural hair like a charm and left it looking really healthy with just one pass.</li>
            <li>If you just want your hair straight, maybe it would be ok (looking at the other reviews).  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I really enjoy using this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for exactly 1 year and 4 months and is completely intact!</li>
            <li>like I stuck my finger in a light socket, but with this brush it was almost completely flat.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a nice, professional hair dryer a year or so ago and that too cut my time in half.  </li>
            <li>My arms and wrists no longer get tired and the elimination of the fly aways makes my hair look shiny and feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>I think that it works for  natural hair if you use a blow dryer with a comb attachment first and then straighten with the brush.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it a five is because I wish the brush was more geared to short and medium hair as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also have really kinky, doily, curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>It seems like such a good idea, and I was so excited when I got it, but it is too difficult to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>Its really easy to use, if you dont know how to dry your hair with a regular hair brush this one will be very helpful.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rough on the hair and is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was moving the brush too quickly without giving the dryer time to dry each section.</li>
            <li>The way the brush opens and closes makes it easy for anyone to blow dry their own hair, because its like having an extra hand to pull the hair tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt give it five stars because after about the fourth time I used it, the little nob that maitains</li>
            <li>Like it so far!</li>
            <li>My hair would fly everywhere and my wrists hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li>Will order another brand with softer, all natural hair bristles.</li>
            <li>If using with blow dryer, direct the heat on part of brush where the holes are.</li>
            <li>if they make brushes like these with soft bristles</li>
            <li>This gives me hair which is straight from the roots (or as close to the roots as possible).</li>
            <li>Does not seem to harm hair so far.</li>
            <li>this is a cheaply made brush, but because it was purchased for less than ten dollars, it is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>But this brush didn&#x27;t do any more than a regular round brush and took longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush tends to wear out fairly quickly so don&#x27;t expect this brush to last too long.</li>
            <li>I wear curly extentsions on my hair and decided to use this with my flat iron to get them bone straight.</li>
            <li>First make sure hair is detangled with a wide tooth comb then past the brush starting from ends.</li>
            <li>I like this brush very much, it really staightens my hair and helps me dry my hair alot faster.</li>
            <li>This entire process took a fraction of the time as my old methods.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s used as a pressing cream and a heat protectant</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t like to use it on my wet hair because it seems it tangles</li>
            <li>This brush moves smoothly and painlessly through even thick hair</li>
            <li>Used the brush w/ a flat iron to straighten my natural curly hair....</li>
            <li>After using the blow dryer, a few quick  swipes of the flat iron, and I was finished!  </li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t too strong for someone with extremely thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>i went natural a year ago and when i wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this product for anyone in need of a brush that really straightens, just watch out for the little nob at the bottom.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it works better on long hair than my short hair.  </li>
            <li> This product cuts my styling time in half, I partly blow dry then use this brush with blow dryer and my hair looks fantastico, just use flat iron for touch ups and ready to go....</li>
            <li> I had two left hands when it came to trying to blow dry my hair with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Straightened my hair like a DREAM when used ahead of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it also work well with a flat iron...</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the frizz and helps straighten the hair when using a flat iron &amp; it also helps when blow drying hair.</li>
            <li> Will never use a flat iron without it again!</li>
            <li> It is much easier to just dry your hair as usual and then just use a flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks before using again to allow my scalp time to recover from the shock of the tension near my temples.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t straightened my hair in a LONG time</li>
            <li> I dried my hair almost completely straight in half the time</li>
            <li> it gets dry and tangled..this hand dandy brush makes my hair look like i got a relaxer!</li>
            <li> both wet and dry</li>
            <li> totally not what I thought it was my hair was a tangled mess after trying to use this</li>
            <li> i just slide it down the hair with the flat iron and before this my ends were always poofy</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use this on daily basis only because the bristles are a bit hard.</li>
            <li> Notas sturdy as expected.</li>
            <li> the brush closed when not in use, fell off somehow.</li>
            <li> This brush was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> hair is halfway down my back, medium thickness, Caucasian, dark brown, and color-treated, for reference.</li>
            <li> It has literally cut my blow dry time in HALF.  </li>
            <li> Between the two of them, my hair is dry in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it got here quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy and thick hair that I usually have to dry then section by section straighten</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough, but it did straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair--biggest problem frizz.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, coarse hair this brush is not for you!  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this snapped in half the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> I never liked the flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I use the brush for my curly, thick, poofy hair when i straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Takes me less than and hour</li>
            <li> Now, it takes me 45 minutes to completely dry my hair (I have thick curly hair).  </li>
            <li> But the bristles are really hard and snag out a couple of my hairs, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, so I give it a heavy use.</li>
            <li> I would spend round brushing it with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I just opened this pack and tried to separate the heads, only to find that it is broken and</li>
            <li> but when you have only one hand to work with because the other is holding a hardryer, it&#x27;s difficult.</li>
            <li> Was a little too hard for my liking</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> i  am not sure if I don&#x27;t know how to use a tensor brush; but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since it was only 10 bucks I opted not to return it.</li>
            <li> Item hard to use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard, yet with product (leave in conditioner) on hair</li>
            <li> Too hard to use</li>
            <li> Bristles are hard.</li>
            <li> wife likes it, but showed me that the dryer is melting the plastic a very small amount where you put the dryer against the brush.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are very hard</li>
            <li> You should consider this if you have very thick, wavy, or curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is already quite straight but it tends to frizz horribly.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> as soon as I opened the box and took this brush out, a spring and broken plastic pieces shot out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bad for your hair because it tugs at your roots really tightly.</li>
            <li> It came with a little plastic smell but was not too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this thing.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting my hair out of it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like it so far! it got here quicker than expected! and works great when&lt;br /&gt;I am straightening my hair! its great</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift.  My hair is already quite straight but it tends to frizz horribly.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but this brush has helped me control the frizz when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get one of these brushes ever since I saw my first review about it on Youtube. I originally saw one on Folica.com for about $15.00 but I read the reviews on this one and decided to go with this one because it seemed great and was affordable. I wear curly extentsions on my hair and decided to use this with my flat iron to get them bone straight. It straightens my natural hair like a charm and left it looking really healthy with just one pass. However, I had to pass through it a few times to get it bone straight on my extensions. The bristles are really hard which is good for gripping purposes but it&#x27;s bad for your hair because it tugs at your roots really tightly. Other than that, I really enjoy using this product!</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to use the brush I was fine, but it did pull out my hair along my front temple. It&#x27;s still sore. It&#x27;s a good brush once you realize that you need to allow the blow dryer to sit for a few seconds before moving upwards. I was moving the brush too quickly without giving the dryer time to dry each section. It&#x27;s a little rough, but it did straighten my hair. I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks before using again to allow my scalp time to recover from the shock of the tension near my temples.</li>
            <li> Well, I always use this type of brush, I used to use those from Conair and they would break every 3 - 4 months. Until I got this one.. I&#x27;ve had one of these for exactly 1 year and 4 months and is completely intact! I use it every day, so I give it a heavy use. I highly recommend this product for its high quality and durability, if you are someone like me who needs this kind of brush, this is the one to get! no other :)</li>
            <li> Item hard to use. Didn&#x27;t make my hair look any better.  This product was not helpful to me at all.</li>
            <li> I just got mine about a week ago and I LOVE IT!! I have naturally wavy and thick hair that I usually have to dry then section by section straighten and it takes forever!! This product cuts my styling time in half, I partly blow dry then use this brush with blow dryer and my hair looks fantastico, just use flat iron for touch ups and ready to go....THANKS!!</li>
            <li> It is great, i love it, leaves my hair shiny and well straightened. Its really easy to use, if you dont know how to dry your hair with a regular hair brush this one will be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Works well but the bristles are very hard so I stopped using it out of fear that I would damage my hair.  Will order another brand with softer, all natural hair bristles.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used one of these on me and I thought the concept was good but when you have only one hand to work with because the other is holding a hardryer, it&#x27;s difficult. It is much easier to just dry your hair as usual and then just use a flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> Just tried the brush and with practice it can be worked it. The bristles are hard, yet with product (leave in conditioner) on hair it glides better. First make sure hair is detangled with a wide tooth comb then past the brush starting from ends. If using with blow dryer, direct the heat on part of brush where the holes are. ***also try best to not clamp brush tightly onto hair, lest you want to pull  hair out.*** im not sure if they make brushes like these with soft bristles so it&#x27;s a keeper for now.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel sticky and gross. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this thing. Would never buy or use again.</li>
            <li> Gets my hair really straight and silky. Everyone always ask me how I get it so straight. I love it</li>
            <li> I had two left hands when it came to trying to blow dry my hair with a regular brush.  My hair would fly everywhere and my wrists hurt like crazy.  Now, it takes me 45 minutes to completely dry my hair (I have thick curly hair).  My arms and wrists no longer get tired and the elimination of the fly aways makes my hair look shiny and feel very soft.  I got one for my sister and my mom.  Some of my friends also purchased one once I told me about it.  I usually do not recommend anything, but this I love.</li>
            <li> Was a little too hard for my liking</li>
            <li> The brush works well.  Unfortunately, it works better on long hair than my short hair.  It is exactly as described and really does straighten curly hair.  I never liked the flat irons.  My hair would not slide through.  This brush moves smoothly and painlessly through even thick hair</li>
            <li> It works great, still getting used to it for the back of my hair</li>
            <li> i  am not sure if I don&#x27;t know how to use a tensor brush; but this one is not for me. Too hard to use</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  It has literally cut my blow dry time in HALF.  I purchased a nice, professional hair dryer a year or so ago and that too cut my time in half.  Between the two of them, my hair is dry in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is halfway down my back, medium thickness, Caucasian, dark brown, and color-treated, for reference.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this brush, I had only stumbled upon it when investigating a chaser comb.  I am so glad I did!  I have extremely curly hair.  I dried my hair almost completely straight in half the time I would spend round brushing it with a blow dryer.  After using the blow dryer, a few quick  swipes of the flat iron, and I was finished!  This entire process took a fraction of the time as my old methods.  When I used a round brush and blow dryer, my hair remained incredibly poofy...like I stuck my finger in a light socket, but with this brush it was almost completely flat.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Notas sturdy as expected.</li>
            <li> This is kind of a hassle to use, I have only used it twice.  It seems like such a good idea, and I was so excited when I got it, but it is too difficult to manipulate.  If only I had one more hand...</li>
            <li> Does NOT work. It just tangles your hair. I had a difficult time getting my hair out of it. I would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This brush is so perfect &amp; Fast. I love this brush</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders, I just used mine today to straighten my &amp;#34;natural kinky&amp;#34; hair while blow drying it and I must say, it did not pull out a hair. I will be buying another one just because. I didnt see if anyone with African American hair had use this or not but I gave it a try and it is a must have for naturals.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair--biggest problem frizz.  I thought by sandwiching my hair with this brush while blow drying, it wouldn&#x27;t allow my hair to have curly, wiry hair sticking out all over.  But this brush didn&#x27;t do any more than a regular round brush and took longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks well made, I had no problem with the bristles holding my hair without pulling or hurting it.  It just didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for.  If you just want your hair straight, maybe it would be ok (looking at the other reviews).  But it didn&#x27;t help the frizz for me and my hair was not &amp;#34;sleek.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Broke right after I received it better off purchasing the actual Denman straightener brush for $13</li>
            <li> This gives me hair which is straight from the roots (or as close to the roots as possible). I hadn&#x27;t straightened my hair in a LONG time but I did so last weekend and I used this and another magic ingredient: Crisco. Apparently it&#x27;s used as a pressing cream and a heat protectant and I wanted to check it out. Worked really well.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much, it really staightens my hair and helps me dry my hair alot faster. I have very very curly latino hair, so for a brush to be able to pull this off is a miracle. The way the brush opens and closes makes it easy for anyone to blow dry their own hair, because its like having an extra hand to pull the hair tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt give it five stars because after about the fourth time I used it, the little nob that maitains the brush closed when not in use, fell off somehow. So I would recommend this product for anyone in need of a brush that really straightens, just watch out for the little nob at the bottom.</li>
            <li> very nice invention but still prefer the comb over this brush&lt;br /&gt;comb is way easier to use, I would not repurchase anything like this instead I\\&quot;ll buy another comb.</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t love it. This is a product that takes a lot of practice to use perfectly. I think that it works for  natural hair if you use a blow dryer with a comb attachment first and then straighten with the brush. Expect your arms to hurt though</li>
            <li> Straightened my hair like a DREAM when used ahead of my flat iron. But the bristles are really hard and snag out a couple of my hairs, so be careful.</li>
            <li> after looking at youtube videos on how to straighten hair i ran across someone mentioning a tension brush and when i bought this it changed my life...okay not like that but it worked wonders for my hair. i went natural a year ago and when i wash and dry my hair it gets dry and tangled..this hand dandy brush makes my hair look like i got a relaxer!</li>
            <li> I just opened this pack and tried to separate the heads, only to find that it is broken and the spring/small pieces into my hands</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too strong for someone with extremely thick and long hair. The brush tends to wear out fairly quickly so don&#x27;t expect this brush to last too long.</li>
            <li> I love the boar bristle on this product. It is perfect for even straightening with every strand. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it a five is because I wish the brush was more geared to short and medium hair as well. May a smaller tool would help speed up the straightening proces for shorter hair lengths.</li>
            <li> It does really straighten the hair. I didn&#x27;t read what the brizzles were made of.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was too static-ky, with the brizzle material. I like the more plastic-ky kind.&lt;br /&gt;But it did do the job. If you ever offer it in another material, please email me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Eileen Haiduk</li>
            <li> Love it. It works great</li>
            <li> Great price (around $4-5)! Works great with hair straightening. It came with a little plastic smell but was not too bad. Does not seem to harm hair so far.</li>
            <li> wife likes it, but showed me that the dryer is melting the plastic a very small amount where you put the dryer against the brush.</li>
            <li> totally not what I thought it was my hair was a tangled mess after trying to use this my hair became stuck in the brush</li>
            <li> I so love this brush not only does it work with a blow dryer but it also work well with a flat iron...i really don&#x27;t like to use it on my wet hair because it seems it tangles but it does straighten it very well..both wet and dry</li>
            <li> Love it. Used the brush w/ a flat iron to straighten my natural curly hair.... I also used it on a friend with extensions. Very pleased with the results. Wouldn&#x27;t use this on daily basis only because the bristles are a bit hard. But overall Great product.</li>
            <li> I use the brush for my curly, thick, poofy hair when i straighten it with a flat iron. i just slide it down the hair with the flat iron and before this my ends were always poofy but now they are just as straight as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I lose a ton of hair when I use this...pulls it right out of my head. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
            <li> This brush itself is not bad, but a screw popped out the very first time I used it. There is no doubt this is a cheaply made brush, but because it was purchased for less than ten dollars, it is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product didnt work for me at all. First I realized that you had to use a hair dryer too, which was a pain. The bristles are very rough and every time that I used it, it made my hair incredibly frizzy and not straight. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it help flaten my hair with my flat iron</li>
            <li> Poorly made. My hair is thick and this snapped in half the second time I used it. Bristles are hard. Not the best brush for healthy hair. Promotes breakage.</li>
            <li> The is a king of all king straightening brush. This really gets the hair straight without a whole bunch of heat transfer to your hair. Really made the process easier. I also have really kinky, doily, curly natural hair. If it work for me it will work for any one else even for my straight hair people this is still good. It also has a lock on the bottom of the brush to stop it from opening and easy storage and when ready to use push lock out and voila.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It gets rid of the frizz and helps straighten the hair when using a flat iron &amp; it also helps when blow drying hair. It&#x27;s a great product because it distributes all of the heat protectant spray/serum while you are using a blow dryer or a flat iron. You should consider this if you have very thick, wavy, or curly hair. It works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This brush was not what I expected.  If you have thick, coarse hair this brush is not for you!  The bristles are rough on the hair and is not user friendly.  Unfortunately, since it was only 10 bucks I opted not to return it.</li>
            <li> as soon as I opened the box and took this brush out, a spring and broken plastic pieces shot out.  I never even got to use it.</li>
            <li> This thing broke right out of the package and wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of shipping to return. I didn&#x27;t even use it once.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Big help with keep my poofy curly hair, makes it shiner and doesnt look so damaged at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for years and this brush makes its so much easier. Takes me less than and hour and I have really curl hair.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Very well made. So impressed, very sturdy use it on clients that have thick curly hair. Genuine ceramic, the bristles are nice and thick great to put shine into anyone&#x27;s hair! Love how it&#x27;s slotted to get that airflow in their! Thx guys!!</li>
            <li> I love this tool. They work hand and hand and should be sold together! Will never use a flat iron without it again! I let my sister in law borrow it and she went and bought her own!</li>
            <li> am really disappointed by the beeches&lt;br /&gt;the brush bristles fell-out of the brush during the first time i triad it .. and the remaining bristles melted int my hair</li>
