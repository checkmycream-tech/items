            <li>This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but it was the best investment.  </li>
            <li>Best I can describe it is this</li>
            <li>So instead of shaving every day for 2 week, I&#x27;ve tried using it for a year to see if the promise of the best shave ever from Philips would come close and</li>
            <li>The best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li>If this razor continues to perform as it has, I will have saved a lot of money over time, protected my skin and have another awesome gadget that works as well as my iPad</li>

            <li>I purchased this product because of a friend who has one and he was very impressed with the movement of the blades, closeness of the shave and the way it cleans the blades between uses.  </li>
            <li>GREAT RAZOR !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while the razor is itself costly, and the replacement blades are costly, it does an excellent job shaving.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s been the best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a close shave, no nicks, and the travel case is very nice to have!</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t complain at all, it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
            <li>the bells and whistles all work great, but the razor itself is a letdown.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll find this review of great use.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great razor that produces the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>I decided to give this razor a shot, as it had great reviews; however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is great shaver.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I got this product.</li>
            <li>Jet cleaner works great.</li>

            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>Works great, very nice to skin.</li>
            <li>And he just LOVED LOVED it when he used it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS THING !!</li>
            <li>The trimmer also has very nice touch.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning system yet, but the shaves are amazing!</li>
            <li>Being able to shave in the shower is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of mid-priced Norelco razors since giving up the blade in 2006, including the very impressive 8170XL and able AT830.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver that i&#x27;ve ever owned, have tried many</li>
            <li>And it does alot more than a PERFECT shave.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to get updated in electric razors!  </li>
            <li>This thing gives a great shave..feels good in my hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best self cleaning system made, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This Norelco works and is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li>but this one has may features and shaves me clean!!!</li>
            <li>Very good shaver, I love it,</li>
            <li>The prices is very good, I love it.</li>
            <li>So my Norelco arrives today (6/10/2013) and like a good boy, I charge it for the recommended time of one hour.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get one if you need a good shave that is.</li>
            <li>Was as advertised, good price, was prompt shipping..</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband and he just loved.</li>
            <li>its not that good.</li>
            <li>For the price I got it for, it is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>but it says it works and have read testimony from others on how good it works this way.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>Im good and set up for quite sometime now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good, but not AS good.</li>
            <li>I tried this on and within one week I feel that it shaves every bit as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I did some fair searching and narrowed on this.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a good deal on these</li>
            <li>After that, every shave ended up being good, painless shave.</li>
            <li>So about a year ago I bought a Panasonic ES8109 based on the good reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
            <li>but this does a real good job of being smooth and close.</li>
            <li>, it feels to my touch just about as good as any manual blade</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good and was always pinching me as I shaved.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor, the jet cleaning system takes up a lot of space, but it works well.  </li>
            <li>I got a good deal on it via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while the razor is itself costly, and the replacement blades are costly, it does an excellent job shaving.on how to clean the razor manually.  </li>
            <li>However, it is a very nice system and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a very nice features.  </li>
            <li>very good, I highly recommend to u guys who wanna good shaver, very good, choose it.</li>
            <li>Still provides a great shave after more than a year with blade replacement.</li>
            <li>We recommend this product and we are very satisfying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I am still very happy with this razor and feel it was worth the price</li>
            <li>I am still very happy with this razor and feel it was worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The razor is very good, very powerful.</li>
            <li>Wonderful easy use and clean razor!  </li>
            <li>If you have or used one, YOU WILL LOVE THE JET CLEANER SYSTEM!  </li>
            <li>And I Love it!</li>
            <li>but I am confident that it will perform just as well there!</li>
            <li>Even in comparing with the higher priced Norelco shavers in the comparison chart, this one seems to be best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent performance and speed of use - a good shave within 3 minutes and an excellent shave in about 5 minutes and very little &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and all, a very good shaver, worth the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and all, a very good shaver, worth the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>The 1250x is by far the most wonderful electric shave that I have ever experienced or</li>
            <li>cleaning system works amazingly, leaves no hair whatsoever in the razor head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a great, smooth shave, with no nicks or cuts like my razor blade did used to.</li>
            <li>and he is happy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I ran the shaving head under warm water before shaving each section of my face (cheek, side of neck, chin, etc.)</li>
            <li>And the travel case is really nice because my husband and I do travel a lot for work.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system has worked well for me and hums nicely in the background.</li>
            <li>Even though its a bit pricey I decided I would like to own it.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning option is also nice.</li>
            <li>I love the result, as It does a good job.</li>
            <li>It still irritates my skin, but it comes in handy</li>
            <li>It still irritates my skin, but it comes in handy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely liked foil shavers because it feels like they eat away at your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you already own a Norelco</li>
            <li>One of the best item in market, I really recommend it for everybody.</li>
            <li>So far so good wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>Product has been really effective.</li>
            <li>Now again, I am comparing to the foil shavers I own and</li>
            <li>but that is another nice touch on how you can use this razor.  </li>
            <li>This is nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice looking pouch and 2 sets of chargers.</li>
            <li>I have never had an electric razor that shaves as good or better than a razor.  </li>
            <li>Switched to this Norelco and is so nice.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a neat gimmick but to be honest</li>
            <li>It cleans up nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that the razor is cleaned and reaady to go all the time.</li>
            <li>I have never been impressed with someone as much as I was with Amazon that day.  </li>
            <li>nice shave always.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth and the cleaning system is very handy.</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is another great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great razor - surprisingly close shave, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I will update on the wetshave using foam tomorrow to try something new but this norelco takes the cake and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>One good thing about this razor is, when it shaves, it would be smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Razor, could not be more happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does provide a fairly close shave and is easy on the face.</li>
            <li>very easy to get finger print on the surface.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco is just not ordinary razor, this razor will be your best friend.</li>
            <li>This is the best design so far from Norelco!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use and nice finish.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, which is perfect for electric shavers because it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The 1250x is superb, close shave and comfortable with the easy clean after use each day with the jetwash.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, because this is far and away the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>I can say unequivocally that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>WOW, this works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li>It is excellent so far.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is wonderful and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all.</li>
            <li>The great news is that Amazon stepped right up to the plate and took care of the product IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li>you are thinking about buying this, I would strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I am happy with and will stay with.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try an electric razor for the first time this year and this razor gives a great shave plus you can use it while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>very light weight.  </li>
            <li>This new razor has a real nice glide to it.</li>
            <li>I am still giving this product 5 star, because the return process was nice and easy.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used many more before this one</li>
            <li>At the moment I&#x27;m in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews of the 8000 series and despite of</li>
            <li>It has now been more than two months</li>
            <li>What more could you ask....</li>
            <li>Love the razor.</li>
            <li>and I think they have done a great job in making a razor that really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, make sure to get Amazon&#x27;s frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re giving this as a gift, get the better packaging for</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco Shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>Then just turn it on and watch it work its magic.</li>
            <li>Be sure you have the cleaning tank PLUGGED in before you try to insert the razor.</li>
            <li>I have to go over the hairs, that somehow pop out to 1/4 inch over night, many times before they cut.  </li>
            <li>They should fire the artists and hire better engineers and testers.  </li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my father as he always wanted some fancy shaver and according to him, he is definitely enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>and the results got better</li>
            <li>I have used Philips Norelco electric razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have lived with for many years.  </li>
            <li>Ive never owned the top of line norelco like now having the jetwash to dip into.</li>
            <li>This baby slices around the contours of your face and works better than I ever thought it would work.</li>
            <li>so I have always preferred shaving cream and the latest 3,4,5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>My wife is happier too because I shave more often</li>
            <li>This thing caused more nicks, ingrown hairs, and irritation than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li>Not only face, but the best body shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Value，i love it，Surprise and is looking forward to wait for its arrival</li>
            <li>I waited a couple of months before writing this ti be sure that I was used to the razor and it continued to work as it did out of the box.</li>
            <li>running this razor under water for 5-10 seconds does most of the cleaning.</li>
            <li>it could be a smoother, better shave if you decide to use it.</li>
            <li>I figure in about a month it will be even better.</li>
            <li>and you get a much better shave after a week or so of just using the Electric razor.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It feels a lot better.</li>
            <li>This may work for (no pun intented) people with more fleshy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As mentioned in manual I tried and waited for more than a month for the skin to get adjusted.</li>
            <li>I love this electric razor</li>
            <li>it does the job and more.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on how well it works, but many reviewers have and can tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have not used the cleaning/lubrication solution yet, but love the idea.  </li>
            <li>and although I cannot see paying over $200 for a shaver as I cannot seeing it being that much better (though MSRP is $250 on this one) unless it puts velvet protector betweeen shaver and your face.  </li>
            <li>But hell, Ipad and Android tablet batteries cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I have had this razor for about 4 months and here is my update:  </li>
            <li>I paid.ies cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I have had this razor for about 4 months and here is my update:  </li>
            <li>This product worked great and price was really affordable as well.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Deciding to go top notch, I chose this model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using all different types of shaving cream, foam works best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks, the shaving has continued to be excellent.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the razor could shave me so smooth in 1 pass, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor does that.  </li>
            <li>Does not replace a razor blade, but better than most of the electric shavers out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this, for my father just to try and see if it works better that my Bruan 7 series, it did not.</li>
            <li>It looks awesome and quiet but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with my purchase,</li>
            <li>Battery life is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Also, the self-cleaning mechanism is better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like the Norelco a lot more.  </li>
            <li>and I do like it for the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>love that it is water proof.</li>
            <li>Love this Norelco.</li>
            <li>I was using another electric razor that was working OK, but then the company &amp;#34; Re- designed&amp;#34; the shaving head on it</li>
            <li>I know there are some more legthy reviews out there</li>
            <li>Braun worked better for me, and gave me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Very smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I thought I was purchasing a more technological improved model than I received.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at grabbing flat lying hair, but does get MOST of it.</li>
            <li>You can clean it faster and more effectively without the system itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>this is a great move forward from older models.</li>
            <li>I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li>it is better to keep it clean!</li>
            <li>This really gives a nice, close shave and has bevels that glide around the contours of your face, so you never miss a spot!</li>
            <li>The system is a good concept, but it does not work consistently.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor and I wanted it to be a good one.</li>
            <li>, whihc gives the very best shave, although a dry shave is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>But it woks great and the smell from the cleaning solution makes the razor smell like you are getting a shave from a brand new razor every time you use it.</li>
            <li>I get a nice, smooth, pain free shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean for a nice close shave</li>
            <li>Also very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Also very easy to clean with or without the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>This Christmas I came across this razor and saw all the positive reviews and though, maybe he just hasn&#x27;t used a good electric razor, so I got it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, her friends looked say it is value for money, the transport process is long, but for me, is a very pleasant shopping experience.</li>
            <li>But, for the huge price I&#x27;d expect everything to be a lot better.</li>
            <li>Thank you Philips Norelco for making something that I will enjoy for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Old one wore out this one is great.</li>
            <li>This has to be the best money that I have ever  spent on an Item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Love the frustration free packaging&lt;</li>
            <li>This is especially handy for 2 day beards when you know it&#x27;s going to be a rough shave.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job on my neck, which my old razor didn&#x27;t do so well with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still -- I love the shave and hope to enjoy the auto-cleaner with this model.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>I do believe its a good razor but for the money I was expecting a really close shave.</li>
            <li>He likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good goods.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it so much, and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t long before I had my flight commander in my face after an ORI for not having a clean and perfect</li>
            <li>My wife was quite impressed too as the other shavers, no matter the angle or how hard/soft</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Jet Clean system works okay, but not a \\&quot;killer feature\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>easy use.</li>
            <li>better to just clean it under the tap.  </li>
            <li>, easy shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The cleaning unit works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Clean System:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not he most aesthetically pleasing piece but charges the razor while cleaning it making it a great-to-have if you don&#x27;t want that &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I love the jet clean too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with Gel and with cleaning liquid its one touch cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I find the trimmer easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>razor burn/ingrown hairs easily</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s convenient and easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to the shave he had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that once I am done shaving I can easily rinse it off.</li>
            <li>I still use mine and it&#x27;s a good device, but it&#x27;s comes second place to a nice manual razor.</li>
            <li>I still use mine and it&#x27;s a good device, but it&#x27;s comes second place to a nice manual razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this two years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be pleasantly surprised with such awesome performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this appears to be a great product, as long as you are willing to make the investment in a fairly pricey system.</li>
            <li>this is a very comfort tool for me, every day and night keep clean is good feeling, you know it.</li>
            <li>Comfortable shave, lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use, and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The real joy was the next day when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li>The cleaning unit works fine,</li>
            <li>The razor is just as smooth and easy as if I had shaved the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I assume it will work fine.</li>
            <li>razor glides easily over problem areas on my neck as well, leaving all of my neck smooth shaved.  </li>
            <li>On that subject, I was very happy with the ability to handle a longer beard.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I already HAVE a perfectly fine shaver!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Most of them were inexpensive  models, and they all worked adequately.</li>
            <li>You can charge it in the plastic stand, or in the Jet Clean cradle if you purchased a model with the Jet Clean system (more on that</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was a lot more than what I wanted to spend on a razor, but after a year of getting my face tore up, I thought it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get something good.</li>
            <li>so I was super excited about that too!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so accurate when shaving.</li>
            <li>He said the pivoting head makes a huge amount of difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 3D movement to fit the various angles of the face is great.</li>
            <li>but this is the one that I actually enjoy shaving with.</li>
            <li>In fact I can now skip a day or 2 and still get a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>great shaver gives a close and quiet shave.</li>
            <li>It cleans its self well gives a comfortable shave and does all I expect</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to maintain and clean with the automated jet cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is also a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>but the areas the razor did go over well were baby smooth.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth shave - close as a blade (or 5)&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth as a blade.</li>
            <li>Everything but the actual saving experience was great.</li>
            <li>If you wanna buy an electric razor still, buy a cheap one rather than this.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the jet cleaning station.</li>
            <li>i have never felt my face so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The razor felt smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and had no rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this would fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit is so easy to clean by just running it under water.  </li>
            <li>The descriptions of the different models were insufficient to make an intelligent purchasing decision.  </li>
            <li>cleaner system is far superior to either Panasonic or Braun, using a non alcohol solution and a device that lifts the shaver out of the liquid to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Original replacement shaver heads are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>this sound familiar to you</li>
            <li>It uses a soapy, lightly perfumed liquid to clean the blades, and you&#x27;re supposed to replace the liquid about every two weeks.</li>
            <li>The jet clean system is fantastic even though the solution my be a bit costly as are the heads</li>
            <li>The unit was delivered in sturdy cardboard packaging and it was easy to get everything out and get the shaver charging quickly.</li>
            <li>Shaves well cleans easily recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t hold the &#x27;whiskers&#x27; as effectively as the older models.  </li>
            <li>Empty your razor and blow it out really good or rinse it good with HOT water and it will stay clean longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to push a button and let it clean itself and I would recommend this shaver to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>gotta love it..;-)</li>
            <li>Cost to shave Is higher, albeit better quality.</li>
            <li>This was able to rinse under hot tap water and worked well.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the big discount, It is a gift, I hope it will work good and easy to clean</li>
            <li>20 years later, I gave this another try, and it truly is improved remarkably.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, built well, sturdy, quiet, good motor to spin the blades.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a blade, but it did give a pretty decent shave.  </li>
            <li>JET CLEAN</li>
            <li>bought a unit that came with the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li>And you can decide for yourself whether the Jet Clean system is worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have to clean every time.</li>
            <li>READ the book before you try to clean it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a close, clean shave and doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or burns whatsoever (with the aid of pre-shave liquid).</li>
            <li>Will update this review as soon as I use the jet clean system.</li>
            <li>He keeps it clean using the jet cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I did not try yet the Jet Clean station and solution.</li>
            <li>so there is not need for me to clean it every day.  </li>
            <li>jet clean system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shaver and after shaving with a blade most of my life, I am a complete</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system works well</li>
            <li>also decided to go with the jet clean system, based on the idea that it is supposed to help keep the blades cleaner and sharper longer.</li>
            <li>I have not tried to jet clean yet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot perform a clean cut / shave for side burns - even with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The cleansing of the razor I do about once a week using the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li>The cleansing of the razor I do about once a week using the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li>Norelco 1250X47 with Jet Clean System</li>
            <li>the jet clean system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that the Jet Clean System would be a gimmick</li>
            <li>you are on travel, there are instructions on how to clean the razor manually.  </li>
            <li>The Braun seems to handle my scalp better, but again the Norelco is by far a better face shave.  </li>
            <li>I like the Jet clean system</li>
            <li>with Jet Clean System]]</li>
            <li>cuts very close and is easy to operate,cleans itself well in the cleaning station,easy to figure out, charges quickly, have not seen a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver it has saved my face its just not natural how much l love it!</li>
            <li>a $50 off special going on as we speak.  </li>
            <li>missed the special offer while this has a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and no taking out the brush heads, just place it under hot water and you can watch the residue run out.</li>
            <li>it works GREAT with a wet shave.  </li>
            <li>The complete set is amazing.</li>
            <li>The wet shave feature works great.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a low grade because it cost a fair piece of change and in reading the user&#x27;s manual</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  have the heart to tell them what a true pain the butt it has become.</li>
            <li>good stuff - everything about the shaver from the design, functionality and reliability is solid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but I notice it.</li>
            <li>I love its smooth shave, close and comfort to a new level.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave right out of the box...</li>
            <li>It cleans easily, either using  hot water from the tap or the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, extremely close shave, easy to clean especially with jet clean system</li>
            <li>Wet shave is most comfortable with Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1250x, even more comfortable and closer than ProGlide.</li>
            <li>Did a fair amount of research prior to buying, so I was pretty comfortable</li>
            <li>1250x is able to cut more hairs with less passes and is a hell of lot more efficient per shave versus 1150x.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your razor heads clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>so I have and older one and this home one that I really love.</li>
            <li>Everything was simple to set up and use for the most satisfactory and rewarding shave that I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will say they have to many models and way high priced.</li>
            <li>It was shipped pretty quickly, and also came in frustration free packing.</li>
            <li>It takes about five minutes to clean, so I pop it in the cradle right after shaving and it finishes the wash cycle just as I finish getting dressed.</li>
            <li>Cleaning was real easy and simple.</li>
            <li>I primarily chose this because I have heard from many reviews the cleaning system on the Braun is cheaply made and lasts only about a year before it stops working.</li>
            <li>I admit I am pretty cheap when it comes to buying items like this.  </li>
            <li>Great razor, but the jet clean was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this, I have to use my old fashioned shaving set to make sure I have a clean shave</li>
            <li>And I love not buying him new razors and blades anymore.</li>
            <li>Previously used Braun and am happy I switched.</li>
            <li>It is an improvement from the Braun version I was previously using and I am happy that I switched.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it does a good job, but the way the razor is designed, it is so easy to clean on its own</li>
            <li>Also, solution price is higher!</li>
            <li>Earlier cases could be opened; many of us are not so inept that we could not replace the Li-ion battery!  </li>
            <li>A great new product from Norelco close shaves charging stand and indicates when cleaning with the included ceaning system is necessary.</li>
            <li>After a few days with this new shaver he said he thought it was the best shave he&#x27;d had with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance and the first few times he seemed to love it but more and more</li>
            <li>I have some issues most of you are lucky not to have - primarily lymphedema from rad and chemo after my second radical head and neck cancer surgery.</li>
            <li>Also, the little trimmer is great for keeping his hair trimmed around his neck and ears.</li>
            <li>I did only whashed out with just water, and it stay very clean all the time easily.</li>
            <li>, In the beginning,  It was not as easy and fast that I thought it should be, but, if you use it regularly, like, day by day, in 2 ou 3 weeks it turns easy to do a nice job shaving and pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I get a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>With this product the skin is calm and shaving is actually fun again.</li>
            <li>Is this razor worth the money?</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband for Christmas,as he rarely has time to shave every morning.  </li>
            <li>My old razor was having to be charged more often</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can get it to work after unplugging it, but rarely and eventually not at all.</li>
            <li>and it is worth and</li>
            <li>Better than my old self cleaning Braun.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>it came as in good quality as i expected it should be.</li>
            <li>And I did try it with this SensoTouch, but frankly the experience wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for just under 4 months now and while it has some nice features overall</li>
            <li>Quiet and effective for a close shave that rivals a blade.</li>
            <li>to clean, just rinse under warm water and let dry.</li>
            <li>Was it worth it?  </li>
            <li>But if this shaver performs this well in a year or two like it does now, the costs and downsides will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>But if this shaver performs this well in a year or two like it does now, the costs and downsides will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Battery Indicator is a useful bonus.</li>
            <li>The jet cleaner device is also nice, although the only thing it does is dipping the shaver blades in the solution and running it.</li>
            <li>Wow, am I glad</li>
            <li>I also thought it would shave better than my 5 year old norelco that i replaced...</li>
            <li>i can only speak for  my partner and me, but we love this razor, and it was worth the money to us!</li>
            <li>Item was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>There are way more expensive ones out there, and of course, cheaper shavers, but I think this one hits the sweet spot in between, and gives a great shave for your investment.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>The coupon is good for other comparable models too.  </li>
            <li>The coupon is good for other comparable models too.  </li>
            <li>right away and get an added 6 months of warranty to 2 1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>jet clean works very well.</li>
            <li>Runs very smothly and has the cleaning station thats always keep the blades clean.</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system works much easier that a previous&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love to see more powerful motors and blades in the future rather than just a redesign over old hardware.  </li>
            <li>I have not had the shaver long enough to report on the sharpness claim, but it does a great job of keeping the shaving heads clean.</li>
            <li>I only use the cleaning process - which is smooth and easy to use - once a month relying on just rinsing it daily.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip that might be helpful is that since you can use this razor wet, with or without shaving cream, or dry you may need to experiment with each to see what works best for your skin.</li>
            <li>Shaving my beard OK; it is better than my old Norelco at shaving several days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li>razor reliably shaves those hard-to-reach places like the neck and angles of the mandible, all while barely making any sound!</li>
            <li>My husband has tried electric razors in the past and wasn&#x27;t happy with them.</li>
            <li>This new style razor is very light and takes some getting used to compared to the older one-piece style.  </li>
            <li>After receiving it I was impressed with it out of the package but after turning it on I noticed it was very quiet and wondered if the blades were turning fast enough to provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li>actually, the razor works fine, cuts close, comfortable, etc.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Norelco 3D electric razor, it clean my face very well.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say, wet or dry, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This new architecture finally fit me.</li>
            <li>It is adequate for drawing a straight line for sideburns, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>this razor does a great job on the different lengths of facial hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed it didn&#x27;t do the greatest job at getting all of my facial hair, especially on my neck and around my jaw, but it was quick and overall painless</li>
            <li>This is replacing my Norelco Speed-8160XL which is still working good, but wanted to have state of the art as my current razor is approx 4 years old.</li>
            <li>this package is also a good option for me.&lt;br /&gt;why not, just less than 20 bux for an additional accessory.</li>
            <li>I only clean it about every two weeks or so, which would be about a week for someone shaving almost every day, and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li>And the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>He like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like the razor very much.  </li>
            <li>This razor has done an excellent job as a daily shaver and has yet to show any real down side.</li>
            <li>tHE CLEANER IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT IS A GREAT IDEA!!!</li>
            <li>Certainly makes it easy for him to stay clean shaven regularly.</li>
            <li>Kinda funny</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the first time use of the razor.</li>
            <li>The heads have enough rotation to handle the grand canyons of my face.  </li>
            <li>Definitely works better with shaving cream/lotion.  </li>
            <li>first shave</li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll most likely shave in the evening when he comes home to shower and keeps this in his car to touch up on the way to work.  </li>
            <li>When you are done shaving, you should rinse the blades of Philips Norelco under hot water, and make sure that there is nothing left in the blades.</li>
            <li>I knew better than paying so much for a shaver, but I wanted something better.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out my old $50 Philips shaver cuts long hairs way better than this one</li>
            <li>The first few cuts may irritate the skin, but after that, the shave is about as good as a shave can get.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave, but irritates sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is its ultimate goal and it  does that and so much more.</li>
            <li>As I said, it was my first eletric razor.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how close and smooth it is.</li>
            <li>But now that I own it, I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money.</li>
            <li>The jet cleaner is motorized, so plug it in first before you try to figure out how the razor fits in.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver system.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>This is no mere marketing gimmick as this razor shaves closer and smoother than I thought an electric could do.  </li>
            <li>After I shave, I open the heads and run it under water for about 5 seconds and most of the hair is gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if not, return and get the Braun, but try this one first.</li>
            <li>It is also alot more quiet than the cheaper electic razors out there that wake up the whole household!</li>
            <li>electric razors, you always get what you pay for, and while the SensoTouch razors may be a tad pricy, you&#x27;ll know exactly where your money went.</li>
            <li>Close shave almost from the first attempt</li>
            <li>Because of the way the heads rotate and pivot not only does it give a better shave then his braun but also shaves his head in minutes.</li>
            <li>It can only give a close shave on the cheeks; or more fleshy and chubby face.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>The second one that was sent to me by amazon was OK though).</li>
            <li>but really only marginally better.</li>
            <li>Works great if you don&#x27;t mind going over the same stubble 10 times or more, my old Phillips was a 1 minute shave if I did it everyday, this thing is 5 times that, way overpriced, it doesn&#x27;t follow the lines of your face at all.  </li>
            <li>The problem I have had and continue to have is that the system \\&quot;thinks\\&quot; there is not enough solution in the solution basin, even when full, and will refuse to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>Apparently rinsing well works fine.</li>
            <li>Excellent build quailty, for those who shave every day, dry or wet with sensitive skin, must-buy product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny over the older style electric razors.</li>
            <li>albeit it takes nearly 2 hours to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave and very little irritation!</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Braun series 7 ultrasonic razor which I liked very much.</li>
            <li>Directions for use were not clear as they were directed at many of their razors and not just the one I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I have not given up on this product because in the long run it is better than cleaning the razor manually.</li>
            <li>In time I am sure the minor irritation will go away.  </li>
            <li>I realize you pretty much get what you pay for</li>
            <li>The whole package is first rate.</li>
            <li>The Philips customer support was awesome and will only encourage me to choose Philips over other brands in the future.</li>
            <li>I have tried this model the past few days and it works great and is very comfortable to shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very quickly and it&#x27;s blonde, so I never get a &#x27;5 o&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the instructions were very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>There certainly is residue at the bottom of the cleaner tank when I change the cleaner.</li>
            <li>one shaves close and the cleaning system while not a necessity of life is certainly nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hope to see new better products in future.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor, and I reviewed many other models before choosing this one.</li>
            <li>I have a real tough beard and no razor is perfect for my face.</li>
            <li>Great gift for guys with tough beard.</li>
            <li>For best results: wet blades, use with a non-foaming shaving cream, and don&#x27;t push too hard against your face</li>
            <li>The razor gets a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>When you put it on it just looks like you&#x27;ve applied too much sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze, and it always looks sleek and modern in its stand (in fact I&#x27;ve received compliments from guests on its &amp;#34;sculpture-like&amp;#34; form).</li>
            <li>Saves so much time over manual shaving</li>
            <li>Noisy, needs many passes  to shave smooth, back to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I would recommend this a an \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot; shaver, because the reviews are reasonably correct and the product works well.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for himself, never owned one, and he just loves it, saves him so much time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely LOVES it.</li>
            <li>It does the job and does it very well.</li>
            <li>It seems as though they really thought this thing through.</li>
            <li>I also use a Norelco electric razor when I don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li>Found the SensoTouch 3D on sale on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Not expecting much except a sleek looking razor, I was happy to see it looked like something of an advancement over the tired old design when I pulled it out of the box.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philips Norelco&#x27;s for years and found them very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Chest, legs, shaves really close.</li>
            <li>I spent way more time shaving with this one, than the Gillette.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend the upgrade.  </li>
            <li>I also really like about this shaver</li>
            <li>and  keeps the blades ready to go at all times.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Husband is AMAZED at the whole Packaged deal.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It is fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over and over areas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after much anticipation.</li>
            <li>Very flexible heads.</li>
            <li>I did not expect the separate charging station, a real plus.</li>
            <li>1st impression was very favorable when you receive the package and see the care taken to protect and display</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much closer and there is no pulling my hairs out when my whiskers are longer.  </li>
            <li>, I notice when I use this shaver that sometimes it causes the zits to cluster, but when I use a real, bladed razor this does not happen.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really need the cleaning</li>
            <li>I use the razon daily and it does an OK job but not as close as my old Norelco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few reviews perhaps overhyped how effective the razor would be in the neck area.  </li>
            <li>to have the old Norelco rotary, and while, like the Braun mentioned above, it was just ok, it didn&#x27;t come close to blade quality.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself is very good - not any different from other standard philips shavers.</li>
            <li>so if you do it right it will be a wash in cost vs razors disposable or semi disposable but its a nicer cut for every day use on sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then all you do is plug-in the Jet Clean system into the power source, and put the razor head down in the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li>As a life long razor user my husband said it was an easy transition to the electric</li>
            <li>/&gt;it gets the cheeks very fast, but chin and neck take a little longer (like most electric razors)</li>
            <li>Every 2 weeks, remove the tray, empty and clean it, and add fresh fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every 2 weeks, remove the tray, empty and clean it, and add fresh fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works so much better than the other one I bought for him.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable head works better than other models.</li>
            <li>I have experienced very little irritation or burn even when going over my neck several times.</li>
            <li>got a new Norelco electric as a gift and used it a handful of times only to decide it wasn&#x27;t better than my 10 year old electric.</li>
            <li>The cleaning unit is a big plus to maintain a clean use of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Not necessary need to buy the Jet Clean Station.</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system is a notch above nice-to-have but not a must-have.  </li>
            <li>After reading several reviews, I decided on the Norelco 1250X/47 with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>I use the Jet Clean every 3rd or 4th time of use.  </li>
            <li>lots of ppl said the jet clean system is not necessary</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and shaves closer with much less time and effort.  </li>
            <li>It works fine dry as well.</li>
            <li>When traveling, it would be nice NOT to have to carry the small recharging stand.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to make sure not to press down, move in circles, not move in circles.</li>
            <li>The jet cleaner looks quite catchy , but is very bulky and does not clean any better than what I do with my hand and some water using about 30 secs of my time.</li>
            <li>But expense of new heads Is deterrent!  </li>
            <li>This new Norelco 3D is a world of difference!  </li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard, and often let it go over weekends, but this shaver has never had any issues giving me a nice, close shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li>easy to clean, very quiet ( My other one sounded like a lawn mower )</li>
            <li>They say to give a new razor 45 days to really start working well, for your face to &amp;#34; get used&amp;#34; to the razor.</li>
            <li>The razor does a decent job, but I bought this product for the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, relatively painless, and waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to this I had used a Braun for most of the last ten years.</li>
            <li>This particular does not shave well.</li>
            <li>Particularly because you don&#x27;t have to buy solution cartridges.</li>
            <li>The solution it comes with will last quite a while (6 months or more) depending on how often you use and is simple to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The person there told me unfortunately he sees this more and more.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is sad at best and why it only gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li>High end performance should compliment a high end price, cause I could got and electric shaver for a lot less but am truly glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product, great shave, I was disappointed that it only lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>Cleaning mechanism is pretty cool but sad that the amount of liquid really doesn&#x27;t give that many</li>
            <li>You should not have high expectations for the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have wanted a high quality razor for years.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor and the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However; I know he would highly recommend the shaver for</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this type of packaging.  </li>
            <li>If you have a beard, I would highly recommend purchasing the optional beard trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>IT IS PURE SEX COMPARED TO THE OLD SYSTEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend springing the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, since it is a far easier method.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend springing the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, since it is a far easier method.  </li>
            <li>As with all new electric razors, it took a couple uses for my face to get used to it, but it is very comfortable now with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li>and I was having difficulty constantly bending over to clean out my old razor over the garbage can.</li>
            <li>The heads in this model have special slots that grab longer hairs (like a few days worth of stubble)</li>
            <li>Bought this razor set for my husband as a Christmas gift because he wanted a new electric razor and this one got decent reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco electric shaver and this new unit is like going from a Yugo to a BMW.  </li>
            <li>And, according to their site, you have to go thru this discharge recharge deal a few times each year to keep the battery meter accurate!</li>
            <li>would note, that after having tried probably eight shavers over the years, I find that they really are a personal fit to the individual face.  </li>
            <li>If you come from a normal razor blade, your skin will take time to adjust to this one.</li>
            <li>This should only come into play on a long trip as the razor holds a charge for over two weeks, but if you need it, then it&#x27;s one more cumbersome thing to pack ,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get pretty much the same result as when using razor blades</li>
            <li>I am normally a stright razor shaver</li>
            <li>transport process more careful is better, the bottle rupture in the transport process, half a bottle of cleaning fluid leakage.</li>
            <li>The liquid level in the Jet cleaner has to be exactly right - if not it throws back error to you</li>
            <li>( I actually returned one because although there was no problem with the shaver, the jet cleaner required  a rocket science knowledge to get the liquid level right.</li>
            <li>looked on amazon for a new razor and read about the Norelco 1250xl47 SenoTouch.  </li>
            <li>Twice Norelco has sent me a new one with no questions asked, which leads me to believe others are also having issues with it.  </li>
            <li>But nothing like the new 1250x.</li>
            <li>Shipped in a protected box...arrived on time and brand new just like how you would receive it in store.....</li>
            <li>I pressed against my beard growth, it just would not get as close or all the hair (even with the new foils).  </li>
            <li>I had to pay $89 for a new handle.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t wet shaved with shaving gel, because one of the reasons I got this was to not have to clean up shaving gel all the time.</li>
            <li>first time, It doesn&#x27;t trim very well as it should be for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new one shows how far the technology has come!  </li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system works satisfactorily, but truth be told, it&#x27;s not completely necessary and adds to the total cost of ownership because you have to buy new bottles of cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This razor 1250x is better than all the others ive had in the past.</li>
            <li>This is the first norelco that actually shaves just as close as my mach razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an electric razor for many years, usually a Norelco or Remington.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers I have tried many different electric razors over the years and haven&#x27;t found one that works well.  </li>
            <li>but I was willing to spend the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The razor came without the usual elaborate plastic maze of packaging designed to prevent thieves from stealing the razor at retail stores.  </li>
            <li>My Husband was in complete awe of this thing!  </li>
            <li>Hey it&#x27;s worth it for the quality, and in the long run still cheaper than a manual razor and blade shaver.  </li>
            <li>the past I had been using a coolskin razor which also gives a great long lasting shave..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as an early Valentine&#x27;s Day gift and he loves this razor!</li>
            <li>and I carefully suck out the clean fluid on top and them dump what is left with all the hairs down the sink and rinse the container with HOT water and refill it.  </li>
            <li>this is the electric shaver I have wanted for decades - it shaves (with shaving cream - wet shave) as close as a blade yet is easy and gentle on skin - you can still use it dry for quick touch ups on the run but the wet shave is by far worth the extra time it takes</li>
            <li>With any new man-toy, he should use it until it&#x27;s completely worn out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The new unit, with self cleaning base and additional charger is great!  </li>
            <li>I got it for a good deal from amazon which brought the total down to like 185$ for the shaver, extra jet wash, and replacement blades already stored away for next year.</li>
            <li>While that really is not a big problem it speaks to the need to fully discharge and recharge about 5x to get the meter showing anywhere near the real minutes remaining.</li>
            <li>The higher end models have features that are not worth the money (e.g., do you really need a five-bar battery indicator instead of a three-bar?)</li>
            <li>After some research, bought this to replace my boyfriend&#x27;s 6+yr old razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor shaves very well and cleans easily,  it actually cleans itself.  </li>
            <li>My husband did not use electric razors because they caused ingrown hair on his face; but has not trouble with this Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, coming off Norelco 1150X 2D Sensotouch after I had switched from Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li>Night and day difference over my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I cant believe the difference in my old norelco that is like 4 yrs old and is now toast</li>
            <li>What a complete package.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I should preface by saying that I have sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li>old and have had 4 electric razors in my life.</li>
            <li>only real negatives I have found are: the model I have, with the self-cleaning unti, takes up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li>I have even gone 7-8 days and had nearly a 1/4&amp;#34; beard and this knocked it out.</li>
            <li>His sensitive skin is now being babied.  </li>
            <li>replacement for old one</li>
            <li>I also have a triple head Norelco that is about 4 years old but strictly an A/C shaver.  </li>
            <li>shave is smooth and although it may take a few passes to get all the stubble, man</li>
            <li>So far I have not had this issue with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t quite fixed my razor burn/</li>
            <li>You need to use one of the chargers, since the charging cord does not plug directly into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the jet cleaner is a piece of junk that should go directly to the morgue.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I noticed is that shave not near as close as with my Bruan, I think it because Braun uses micro vibrations, and it really works!</li>
            <li>Have used several times with shaving gel and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>after he used it he couldn&#x27;t stop RAVING!&lt;br /&gt;Instead of grinding his old thing across his face a million times, one swipe does it all.</li>
            <li>I just remember that I could never get the feeling of soft skin that I could get after shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>I get a shave that is really very close if not equal to that of a razor; but I get the benefit of taking the shaver with me wherever I go, and keep it for days without recharging.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It is a very close shave, but still requires several passes on the neck</li>
            <li>Despite replacing shaver head, though, the Braun would still miss some spots, didn&#x27;t give the cleanest of shaves and was outright loud.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>He still uses it frequently though, but I think we will try the Dollar Shave Club for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny especially since I use the electric daily.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a bottle of cleaning liquid but its a joke - wont last for more than a few</li>
            <li>Many years ago I owned a corded Phillips rotating head shaver, and used it until the blades needed replacement, then threw it away because I was never impressed with it and did not think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>good item ,too expensive</li>
            <li>did a quick comparo over the SensoTouch lineup and the only major difference between the various models is the design and finish.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, cuts close and smooth with little irritation and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, cuts close and smooth with little irritation and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more money than I&#x27;d typically spend, but I think we&#x27;ve definitely gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  </li>
            <li>the  He has far less red bumps and irritation and his face is baby smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The package it came in was secured, but for some reason when I opened the package I just saw a plain cover with the picture of Philips Norelco instead of the original packaging.</li>
            <li>high price tag decided to give them one last try.</li>
            <li>This takes him about double the time shaving than a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean system also is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>It lightly dances across the face - wet or dry - leaving no stubble in its wake.</li>
            <li>The first shave was as close as a razor wet shave in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I had to switch back to a normal shaver to get my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shave is - you don&#x27;t need to apply heavy pressure to your face to get a close shave (BIG change from the Braun).  </li>
            <li>In fact, I normally use shaving gel when shaving with this so that could be the key for me getting a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>packaging comes with the large Jet Clean system, a smaller travel-friendly charger, a travel pouch, the razor, a small bottle of the Jet Clean solution, the charging cable, a small cleaning brush and some instructions.  </li>
            <li>Not really an issue, as long as you clean it AFTER you</li>
            <li>but I point it out because it certainly can be if your space is limited.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I paid a little extra and got the self-cleaning model, for two primary reasons: it was on sale</li>
            <li>but they do work and you only need a new razor every 2 years</li>
            <li>I decided to try a new approach the next day.</li>
            <li>Now know that shaving is also a live technical</li>
            <li>Wish there was an extra set of shaver head - but I can live without that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had to buy a new razor today, it would be this same razor,.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor late in December 2012, because I wanted a complete shave which was smooth on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried it in the shover - not only does it not shave as close, it takes longer to do, so I gave up on wet-shaving fairly early early in the year.</li>
            <li>The razor is not as quiet as when I first opened up the box, but it is still not loud at all.  </li>
            <li>The razor is not as quiet as when I first opened up the box, but it is still not loud at all.  </li>
            <li>went with the 1250/47 model because I wanted the jet cleaning system not offered in the 1250/40, but didn&#x27;t think the extra battery length was really all that necessary in the 1280/42.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m gonna go through all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother?</li>
            <li>all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother?</li>
            <li>Price is some what higher than other products.</li>
            <li>Returned, but not due to build quality...just not for me.</li>
            <li>The blade is as sharp as it was when I first got it, no complaints there.</li>
            <li>It will probably do fine, but I still like the security of the hard travel case.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it is more difficult to clean manually than some other Norelco and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my experience, it is more difficult to clean manually than some other Norelco and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not coming from foil shaver world with fast motors; my current shaver a ten year old phili-shave (European model).</li>
            <li>The packaging to me is about right as it has an outer box that does need to be cut open due to tape to keep it sealed.  </li>
            <li>So far my husband is enjoying this Electric Razor, he has both dry shaved and wet and enjoys the close shave which he has never achieved with previous Electric Razors.</li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR IS WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT!!!</li>
            <li>This is the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, my old one was 8-9 years ago</li>
            <li>When I had my old shaver it would pull the hair, and leave red spots on my neck when I was done with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li>I guess I should try to replace the battery in my old Philips shaver and go back to using</li>
            <li>Speaking for only myself I found the Braun to be the easiest to  use and it delivered the closest shave with no razor burn whatsoever, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a solid device, but it does NOT replace a manual razor for people with sensitive skin nor does it provide as close a shave.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a solid device, but it does NOT replace a manual razor for people with sensitive skin nor does it provide as close a shave.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with in-grown facial hair for years, and within a month of using the product, my face is almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>I think Norelco did this to cut costs and not because a soft pouch was not necessary for protection.</li>
            <li>So based on our friends comments and my checking on line reviews I purchased this product and my husband was delightfully surprised and totally agrees with his buddy !!  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to shaving with a blade, but because I have sensitive skin and get</li>
            <li>/&gt;I only have 2 complaints:  1) wish the cord would plug directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver is made in the Netherlands and the quality is apparent.</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old male, so every so often I still get a zit or two</li>
            <li>you can barely tell that this one is running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only other downside is that for frequent travelers, you have to take the charging cord and the stand with you as you cannot plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it as you could with older models.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great razor, but expect to only get about 12-15 months out of it before you have to buy another brand new razor to get the same quality shaver head.</li>
            <li>Battery charges fairly quickly and holds on for about 2 weeks with a daily heavy shave.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>If I had known that these new electric razors shaved this close without any irritation, I would have done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li>I always use the shaver after the hot shower and dry shave once face is dry.</li>
            <li>I was surprised of how much juice this little razor has in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could repeat all of the positive feedback from the other reviews of this shaver, but I want to share my recent experience with Philips customer</li>
            <li>That is the biggest issue I have always run into, especially on my neck, so I always use some sort of shaving gel, but it never really helped the irritation on my neck much.</li>
            <li>It does okay on cheeks, but chin, upper lip, jawline and neck results are all poor no matter how I try to move the razor</li>
            <li>One nice thing that carries over is that the razor chargers are compatible so cudos to Norelco for keeping an eye on old customers be that intentional or just a cost cutting attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particularly like the wet shave option.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on this because I had one of the older style Norelco shavers that just never seemed to work as well as I expected it should.  </li>
            <li>First shave irritated my neck a little but got 99% of the hairs.</li>
            <li>To me, unless you grow a heavy beard in a 24 hour period, every other day should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Dry shaving on the 2nd day IS better with SensoTouch than with a manual razor, but only because I&#x27;m choosing between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;</li>
            <li>Dry shaving on the 2nd day IS better with SensoTouch than with a manual razor, but only because I&#x27;m choosing between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;</li>
            <li>it is awkward at first, but you get used to it very quick.</li>
            <li>At first it took my skin a few shaves to adjust to using a triple rotary system without irritation.</li>
            <li>Worth the trade off for no more face cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>rinse my shaver every couple of days under hot water although they say to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li>This is my 5th Norelco shaver, having upgraded a few times since the first one I received as a hand-me-down from my grandfather.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time with shaving cream and it was just as smooth as if I had done it with a razor but without the razor burn and without the fear of cutting myself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors in the past and decided to get myself a new, high tech one.</li>
            <li>I do not love having to purchase new solution once a month as they say is normal to do.  </li>
            <li>But this one can be used wet or dry, and always gives you a real close shave.</li>
            <li>nothing big and still less than I got from the foil shavers since I had to keep repeating the areas so much to get rid of pesky hairs or to get a closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that you can use this wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>(super lazy ) and cant bring yourself to spend another 30 secs cleaning the shaver head !&lt;</li>
            <li>Was concerned that the new head might be fragile since it only sits on a center post but seems well built and rugged.  </li>

            <li> the bells and whistles all work great, but the razor itself is a letdown.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll find this review of great use.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a great razor that produces the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> lol)</li>
            <li> I decided to give this razor a shot, as it had great reviews; however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> Worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is great shaver.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got this product.</li>
            <li> Jet cleaner works great.</li>
            <li> I am happy I selected this razor.</li>
            <li> Norelco had a great deal this holiday season on it.</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> Works great, very nice to skin.</li>
            <li> And he just LOVED LOVED it when he used it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING !!</li>
            <li> The trimmer also has very nice touch.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning system yet, but the shaves are amazing!</li>
            <li> Being able to shave in the shower is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of mid-priced Norelco razors since giving up the blade in 2006, including the very impressive 8170XL and able AT830.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver that i&#x27;ve ever owned, have tried many</li>
            <li> And it does alot more than a PERFECT shave.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to get updated in electric razors!  </li>
            <li> This thing gives a great shave..feels good in my hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best self cleaning system made, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This Norelco works and is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> but this one has may features and shaves me clean!!!</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, I love it,</li>
            <li> The prices is very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> So my Norelco arrives today (6/10/2013) and like a good boy, I charge it for the recommended time of one hour.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get one if you need a good shave that is.</li>
            <li> Was as advertised, good price, was prompt shipping..</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and he just loved.</li>
            <li> its not that good.</li>
            <li> For the price I got it for, it is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> but it says it works and have read testimony from others on how good it works this way.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Im good and set up for quite sometime now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good, but not AS good.</li>
            <li> I tried this on and within one week I feel that it shaves every bit as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I did some fair searching and narrowed on this.</li>
            <li> Amazon had a good deal on these</li>
            <li> After that, every shave ended up being good, painless shave.</li>
            <li> So about a year ago I bought a Panasonic ES8109 based on the good reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
            <li> but this does a real good job of being smooth and close.</li>
            <li> , it feels to my touch just about as good as any manual blade</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good and was always pinching me as I shaved.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor, the jet cleaning system takes up a lot of space, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> I got a good deal on it via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, while the razor is itself costly, and the replacement blades are costly, it does an excellent job shaving.on how to clean the razor manually.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a very nice system and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and a very nice features.  </li>
            <li> very good, I highly recommend to u guys who wanna good shaver, very good, choose it.</li>
            <li> Still provides a great shave after more than a year with blade replacement.</li>
            <li> We recommend this product and we are very satisfying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I am still very happy with this razor and feel it was worth the price</li>
            <li> I am still very happy with this razor and feel it was worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, very powerful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful easy use and clean razor!  </li>
            <li> If you have or used one, YOU WILL LOVE THE JET CLEANER SYSTEM!  </li>
            <li> And I Love it!</li>
            <li> but I am confident that it will perform just as well there!</li>
            <li> Even in comparing with the higher priced Norelco shavers in the comparison chart, this one seems to be best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent performance and speed of use - a good shave within 3 minutes and an excellent shave in about 5 minutes and very little &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and all, a very good shaver, worth the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and all, a very good shaver, worth the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> The 1250x is by far the most wonderful electric shave that I have ever experienced or</li>
            <li> cleaning system works amazingly, leaves no hair whatsoever in the razor head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a great, smooth shave, with no nicks or cuts like my razor blade did used to.</li>
            <li> and he is happy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I ran the shaving head under warm water before shaving each section of my face (cheek, side of neck, chin, etc.)</li>
            <li> And the travel case is really nice because my husband and I do travel a lot for work.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system has worked well for me and hums nicely in the background.</li>
            <li> Even though its a bit pricey I decided I would like to own it.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning option is also nice.</li>
            <li> I love the result, as It does a good job.</li>
            <li> It still irritates my skin, but it comes in handy</li>
            <li> It still irritates my skin, but it comes in handy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely liked foil shavers because it feels like they eat away at your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you already own a Norelco</li>
            <li> One of the best item in market, I really recommend it for everybody.</li>
            <li> So far so good wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> Product has been really effective.</li>
            <li> Now again, I am comparing to the foil shavers I own and</li>
            <li> but that is another nice touch on how you can use this razor.  </li>
            <li> This is nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice looking pouch and 2 sets of chargers.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric razor that shaves as good or better than a razor.  </li>
            <li> Switched to this Norelco and is so nice.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a neat gimmick but to be honest</li>
            <li> It cleans up nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that the razor is cleaned and reaady to go all the time.</li>
            <li> I have never been impressed with someone as much as I was with Amazon that day.  </li>
            <li> nice shave always.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth and the cleaning system is very handy.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is another great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great razor - surprisingly close shave, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I will update on the wetshave using foam tomorrow to try something new but this norelco takes the cake and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> One good thing about this razor is, when it shaves, it would be smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Razor, could not be more happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does provide a fairly close shave and is easy on the face.</li>
            <li> very easy to get finger print on the surface.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco is just not ordinary razor, this razor will be your best friend.</li>
            <li> This is the best design so far from Norelco!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and nice finish.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, which is perfect for electric shavers because it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li> It is, by far, the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The 1250x is superb, close shave and comfortable with the easy clean after use each day with the jetwash.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, because this is far and away the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I can say unequivocally that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> WOW, this works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li> It is excellent so far.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is wonderful and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all.</li>
            <li> The great news is that Amazon stepped right up to the plate and took care of the product IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> you are thinking about buying this, I would strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I am happy with and will stay with.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try an electric razor for the first time this year and this razor gives a great shave plus you can use it while you are in the shower.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> very light weight.  </li>
            <li> This new razor has a real nice glide to it.</li>
            <li> I am still giving this product 5 star, because the return process was nice and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used many more before this one</li>
            <li> At the moment I&#x27;m in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews of the 8000 series and despite of</li>
            <li> It has now been more than two months</li>
            <li> What more could you ask....</li>
            <li> Love the razor.</li>
            <li> and I think they have done a great job in making a razor that really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, make sure to get Amazon&#x27;s frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re giving this as a gift, get the better packaging for</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> Then just turn it on and watch it work its magic.</li>
            <li> Be sure you have the cleaning tank PLUGGED in before you try to insert the razor.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the hairs, that somehow pop out to 1/4 inch over night, many times before they cut.  </li>
            <li> They should fire the artists and hire better engineers and testers.  </li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my father as he always wanted some fancy shaver and according to him, he is definitely enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> and the results got better</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Norelco electric razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have lived with for many years.  </li>
            <li> Ive never owned the top of line norelco like now having the jetwash to dip into.</li>
            <li> This baby slices around the contours of your face and works better than I ever thought it would work.</li>
            <li> so I have always preferred shaving cream and the latest 3,4,5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> My wife is happier too because I shave more often</li>
            <li> This thing caused more nicks, ingrown hairs, and irritation than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li> Not only face, but the best body shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Value，i love it，Surprise and is looking forward to wait for its arrival</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of months before writing this ti be sure that I was used to the razor and it continued to work as it did out of the box.</li>
            <li> running this razor under water for 5-10 seconds does most of the cleaning.</li>
            <li> it could be a smoother, better shave if you decide to use it.</li>
            <li> I figure in about a month it will be even better.</li>
            <li> and you get a much better shave after a week or so of just using the Electric razor.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It feels a lot better.</li>
            <li> This may work for (no pun intented) people with more fleshy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As mentioned in manual I tried and waited for more than a month for the skin to get adjusted.</li>
            <li> I love this electric razor</li>
            <li> it does the job and more.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on how well it works, but many reviewers have and can tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not used the cleaning/lubrication solution yet, but love the idea.  </li>
            <li> and although I cannot see paying over $200 for a shaver as I cannot seeing it being that much better (though MSRP is $250 on this one) unless it puts velvet protector betweeen shaver and your face.  </li>
            <li> But hell, Ipad and Android tablet batteries cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I have had this razor for about 4 months and here is my update:  </li>
            <li> I paid.ies cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I have had this razor for about 4 months and here is my update:  </li>
            <li> This product worked great and price was really affordable as well.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Deciding to go top notch, I chose this model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using all different types of shaving cream, foam works best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks, the shaving has continued to be excellent.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the razor could shave me so smooth in 1 pass, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor does that.  </li>
            <li> Does not replace a razor blade, but better than most of the electric shavers out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this, for my father just to try and see if it works better that my Bruan 7 series, it did not.</li>
            <li> It looks awesome and quiet but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with my purchase,</li>
            <li> Battery life is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Also, the self-cleaning mechanism is better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like the Norelco a lot more.  </li>
            <li> and I do like it for the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> love that it is water proof.</li>
            <li> Love this Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was using another electric razor that was working OK, but then the company &amp;#34; Re- designed&amp;#34; the shaving head on it</li>
            <li> I know there are some more legthy reviews out there</li>
            <li> Braun worked better for me, and gave me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing a more technological improved model than I received.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at grabbing flat lying hair, but does get MOST of it.</li>
            <li> You can clean it faster and more effectively without the system itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> this is a great move forward from older models.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li> it is better to keep it clean!</li>
            <li> This really gives a nice, close shave and has bevels that glide around the contours of your face, so you never miss a spot!</li>
            <li> The system is a good concept, but it does not work consistently.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor and I wanted it to be a good one.</li>
            <li> , whihc gives the very best shave, although a dry shave is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> But it woks great and the smell from the cleaning solution makes the razor smell like you are getting a shave from a brand new razor every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I get a nice, smooth, pain free shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean for a nice close shave</li>
            <li> Also very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Also very easy to clean with or without the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> This Christmas I came across this razor and saw all the positive reviews and though, maybe he just hasn&#x27;t used a good electric razor, so I got it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , her friends looked say it is value for money, the transport process is long, but for me, is a very pleasant shopping experience.</li>
            <li> But, for the huge price I&#x27;d expect everything to be a lot better.</li>
            <li> Thank you Philips Norelco for making something that I will enjoy for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Old one wore out this one is great.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best money that I have ever  spent on an Item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Love the frustration free packaging&lt;</li>
            <li> This is especially handy for 2 day beards when you know it&#x27;s going to be a rough shave.  </li>
            <li> It also does a great job on my neck, which my old razor didn&#x27;t do so well with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still -- I love the shave and hope to enjoy the auto-cleaner with this model.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I do believe its a good razor but for the money I was expecting a really close shave.</li>
            <li> He likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good goods.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it so much, and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long before I had my flight commander in my face after an ORI for not having a clean and perfect</li>
            <li> My wife was quite impressed too as the other shavers, no matter the angle or how hard/soft</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Jet Clean system works okay, but not a \\&quot;killer feature\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> easy use.</li>
            <li> better to just clean it under the tap.  </li>
            <li> , easy shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Clean System:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not he most aesthetically pleasing piece but charges the razor while cleaning it making it a great-to-have if you don&#x27;t want that &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I love the jet clean too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with Gel and with cleaning liquid its one touch cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I find the trimmer easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> razor burn/ingrown hairs easily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s convenient and easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to the shave he had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that once I am done shaving I can easily rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I still use mine and it&#x27;s a good device, but it&#x27;s comes second place to a nice manual razor.</li>
            <li> I still use mine and it&#x27;s a good device, but it&#x27;s comes second place to a nice manual razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this two years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be pleasantly surprised with such awesome performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this appears to be a great product, as long as you are willing to make the investment in a fairly pricey system.</li>
            <li> this is a very comfort tool for me, every day and night keep clean is good feeling, you know it.</li>
            <li> Comfortable shave, lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> The real joy was the next day when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit works fine,</li>
            <li> The razor is just as smooth and easy as if I had shaved the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I assume it will work fine.</li>
            <li> razor glides easily over problem areas on my neck as well, leaving all of my neck smooth shaved.  </li>
            <li> On that subject, I was very happy with the ability to handle a longer beard.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I already HAVE a perfectly fine shaver!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Most of them were inexpensive  models, and they all worked adequately.</li>
            <li> You can charge it in the plastic stand, or in the Jet Clean cradle if you purchased a model with the Jet Clean system (more on that</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was a lot more than what I wanted to spend on a razor, but after a year of getting my face tore up, I thought it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get something good.</li>
            <li> so I was super excited about that too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so accurate when shaving.</li>
            <li> He said the pivoting head makes a huge amount of difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3D movement to fit the various angles of the face is great.</li>
            <li> but this is the one that I actually enjoy shaving with.</li>
            <li> In fact I can now skip a day or 2 and still get a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> great shaver gives a close and quiet shave.</li>
            <li> It cleans its self well gives a comfortable shave and does all I expect</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to maintain and clean with the automated jet cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is also a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> but the areas the razor did go over well were baby smooth.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth shave - close as a blade (or 5)&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth as a blade.</li>
            <li> Everything but the actual saving experience was great.</li>
            <li> If you wanna buy an electric razor still, buy a cheap one rather than this.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the jet cleaning station.</li>
            <li> i have never felt my face so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The razor felt smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and had no rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this would fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit is so easy to clean by just running it under water.  </li>
            <li> The descriptions of the different models were insufficient to make an intelligent purchasing decision.  </li>
            <li> cleaner system is far superior to either Panasonic or Braun, using a non alcohol solution and a device that lifts the shaver out of the liquid to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Original replacement shaver heads are no longer available.  </li>
            <li> this sound familiar to you</li>
            <li> It uses a soapy, lightly perfumed liquid to clean the blades, and you&#x27;re supposed to replace the liquid about every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The jet clean system is fantastic even though the solution my be a bit costly as are the heads</li>
            <li> The unit was delivered in sturdy cardboard packaging and it was easy to get everything out and get the shaver charging quickly.</li>
            <li> Shaves well cleans easily recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t hold the &#x27;whiskers&#x27; as effectively as the older models.  </li>
            <li> Empty your razor and blow it out really good or rinse it good with HOT water and it will stay clean longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to push a button and let it clean itself and I would recommend this shaver to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> gotta love it..;-)</li>
            <li> Cost to shave Is higher, albeit better quality.</li>
            <li> This was able to rinse under hot tap water and worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the big discount, It is a gift, I hope it will work good and easy to clean</li>
            <li> 20 years later, I gave this another try, and it truly is improved remarkably.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, built well, sturdy, quiet, good motor to spin the blades.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a blade, but it did give a pretty decent shave.  </li>
            <li> JET CLEAN</li>
            <li> bought a unit that came with the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li> And you can decide for yourself whether the Jet Clean system is worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have to clean every time.</li>
            <li> READ the book before you try to clean it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a close, clean shave and doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or burns whatsoever (with the aid of pre-shave liquid).</li>
            <li> Will update this review as soon as I use the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> He keeps it clean using the jet cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I did not try yet the Jet Clean station and solution.</li>
            <li> so there is not need for me to clean it every day.  </li>
            <li> jet clean system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and after shaving with a blade most of my life, I am a complete</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system works well</li>
            <li> also decided to go with the jet clean system, based on the idea that it is supposed to help keep the blades cleaner and sharper longer.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to jet clean yet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cannot perform a clean cut / shave for side burns - even with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The cleansing of the razor I do about once a week using the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li> The cleansing of the razor I do about once a week using the Jet Clean System</li>
            <li> Norelco 1250X47 with Jet Clean System</li>
            <li> the jet clean system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that the Jet Clean System would be a gimmick</li>
            <li> you are on travel, there are instructions on how to clean the razor manually.  </li>
            <li> The Braun seems to handle my scalp better, but again the Norelco is by far a better face shave.  </li>
            <li> I like the Jet clean system</li>
            <li> with Jet Clean System]]</li>
            <li> cuts very close and is easy to operate,cleans itself well in the cleaning station,easy to figure out, charges quickly, have not seen a better price.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver it has saved my face its just not natural how much l love it!</li>
            <li> a $50 off special going on as we speak.  </li>
            <li> missed the special offer while this has a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and no taking out the brush heads, just place it under hot water and you can watch the residue run out.</li>
            <li> it works GREAT with a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> The complete set is amazing.</li>
            <li> The wet shave feature works great.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a low grade because it cost a fair piece of change and in reading the user&#x27;s manual</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  have the heart to tell them what a true pain the butt it has become.</li>
            <li> good stuff - everything about the shaver from the design, functionality and reliability is solid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but I notice it.</li>
            <li> I love its smooth shave, close and comfort to a new level.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave right out of the box...</li>
            <li> It cleans easily, either using  hot water from the tap or the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, extremely close shave, easy to clean especially with jet clean system</li>
            <li> Wet shave is most comfortable with Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1250x, even more comfortable and closer than ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Did a fair amount of research prior to buying, so I was pretty comfortable</li>
            <li> 1250x is able to cut more hairs with less passes and is a hell of lot more efficient per shave versus 1150x.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your razor heads clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> so I have and older one and this home one that I really love.</li>
            <li> Everything was simple to set up and use for the most satisfactory and rewarding shave that I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will say they have to many models and way high priced.</li>
            <li> It was shipped pretty quickly, and also came in frustration free packing.</li>
            <li> It takes about five minutes to clean, so I pop it in the cradle right after shaving and it finishes the wash cycle just as I finish getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Cleaning was real easy and simple.</li>
            <li> I primarily chose this because I have heard from many reviews the cleaning system on the Braun is cheaply made and lasts only about a year before it stops working.</li>
            <li> I admit I am pretty cheap when it comes to buying items like this.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, but the jet clean was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this, I have to use my old fashioned shaving set to make sure I have a clean shave</li>
            <li> And I love not buying him new razors and blades anymore.</li>
            <li> Previously used Braun and am happy I switched.</li>
            <li> It is an improvement from the Braun version I was previously using and I am happy that I switched.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it does a good job, but the way the razor is designed, it is so easy to clean on its own</li>
            <li> Also, solution price is higher!</li>
            <li> Earlier cases could be opened; many of us are not so inept that we could not replace the Li-ion battery!  </li>
            <li> A great new product from Norelco close shaves charging stand and indicates when cleaning with the included ceaning system is necessary.</li>
            <li> After a few days with this new shaver he said he thought it was the best shave he&#x27;d had with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and the first few times he seemed to love it but more and more</li>
            <li> I have some issues most of you are lucky not to have - primarily lymphedema from rad and chemo after my second radical head and neck cancer surgery.</li>
            <li> Also, the little trimmer is great for keeping his hair trimmed around his neck and ears.</li>
            <li> I did only whashed out with just water, and it stay very clean all the time easily.</li>
            <li> , In the beginning,  It was not as easy and fast that I thought it should be, but, if you use it regularly, like, day by day, in 2 ou 3 weeks it turns easy to do a nice job shaving and pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I get a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> With this product the skin is calm and shaving is actually fun again.</li>
            <li> Is this razor worth the money?</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas,as he rarely has time to shave every morning.  </li>
            <li> My old razor was having to be charged more often</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can get it to work after unplugging it, but rarely and eventually not at all.</li>
            <li> and it is worth and</li>
            <li> Better than my old self cleaning Braun.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> it came as in good quality as i expected it should be.</li>
            <li> And I did try it with this SensoTouch, but frankly the experience wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for just under 4 months now and while it has some nice features overall</li>
            <li> Quiet and effective for a close shave that rivals a blade.</li>
            <li> to clean, just rinse under warm water and let dry.</li>
            <li> Was it worth it?  </li>
            <li> But if this shaver performs this well in a year or two like it does now, the costs and downsides will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> But if this shaver performs this well in a year or two like it does now, the costs and downsides will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Battery Indicator is a useful bonus.</li>
            <li> The jet cleaner device is also nice, although the only thing it does is dipping the shaver blades in the solution and running it.</li>
            <li> Wow, am I glad</li>
            <li> I also thought it would shave better than my 5 year old norelco that i replaced...</li>
            <li> i can only speak for  my partner and me, but we love this razor, and it was worth the money to us!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> There are way more expensive ones out there, and of course, cheaper shavers, but I think this one hits the sweet spot in between, and gives a great shave for your investment.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> The coupon is good for other comparable models too.  </li>
            <li> The coupon is good for other comparable models too.  </li>
            <li> right away and get an added 6 months of warranty to 2 1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> jet clean works very well.</li>
            <li> Runs very smothly and has the cleaning station thats always keep the blades clean.</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system works much easier that a previous&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love to see more powerful motors and blades in the future rather than just a redesign over old hardware.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the shaver long enough to report on the sharpness claim, but it does a great job of keeping the shaving heads clean.</li>
            <li> I only use the cleaning process - which is smooth and easy to use - once a month relying on just rinsing it daily.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip that might be helpful is that since you can use this razor wet, with or without shaving cream, or dry you may need to experiment with each to see what works best for your skin.</li>
            <li> Shaving my beard OK; it is better than my old Norelco at shaving several days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li> razor reliably shaves those hard-to-reach places like the neck and angles of the mandible, all while barely making any sound!</li>
            <li> My husband has tried electric razors in the past and wasn&#x27;t happy with them.</li>
            <li> This new style razor is very light and takes some getting used to compared to the older one-piece style.  </li>
            <li> After receiving it I was impressed with it out of the package but after turning it on I noticed it was very quiet and wondered if the blades were turning fast enough to provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li> actually, the razor works fine, cuts close, comfortable, etc.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco 3D electric razor, it clean my face very well.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say, wet or dry, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This new architecture finally fit me.</li>
            <li> It is adequate for drawing a straight line for sideburns, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> this razor does a great job on the different lengths of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed it didn&#x27;t do the greatest job at getting all of my facial hair, especially on my neck and around my jaw, but it was quick and overall painless</li>
            <li> This is replacing my Norelco Speed-8160XL which is still working good, but wanted to have state of the art as my current razor is approx 4 years old.</li>
            <li> this package is also a good option for me.&lt;br /&gt;why not, just less than 20 bux for an additional accessory.</li>
            <li> I only clean it about every two weeks or so, which would be about a week for someone shaving almost every day, and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li> And the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> He like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like the razor very much.  </li>
            <li> This razor has done an excellent job as a daily shaver and has yet to show any real down side.</li>
            <li> tHE CLEANER IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT IS A GREAT IDEA!!!</li>
            <li> Certainly makes it easy for him to stay clean shaven regularly.</li>
            <li> Kinda funny</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the first time use of the razor.</li>
            <li> The heads have enough rotation to handle the grand canyons of my face.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works better with shaving cream/lotion.  </li>
            <li> first shave</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll most likely shave in the evening when he comes home to shower and keeps this in his car to touch up on the way to work.  </li>
            <li> When you are done shaving, you should rinse the blades of Philips Norelco under hot water, and make sure that there is nothing left in the blades.</li>
            <li> I knew better than paying so much for a shaver, but I wanted something better.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out my old $50 Philips shaver cuts long hairs way better than this one</li>
            <li> The first few cuts may irritate the skin, but after that, the shave is about as good as a shave can get.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave, but irritates sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is its ultimate goal and it  does that and so much more.</li>
            <li> As I said, it was my first eletric razor.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how close and smooth it is.</li>
            <li> But now that I own it, I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> The jet cleaner is motorized, so plug it in first before you try to figure out how the razor fits in.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver system.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> This is no mere marketing gimmick as this razor shaves closer and smoother than I thought an electric could do.  </li>
            <li> After I shave, I open the heads and run it under water for about 5 seconds and most of the hair is gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if not, return and get the Braun, but try this one first.</li>
            <li> It is also alot more quiet than the cheaper electic razors out there that wake up the whole household!</li>
            <li> electric razors, you always get what you pay for, and while the SensoTouch razors may be a tad pricy, you&#x27;ll know exactly where your money went.</li>
            <li> Close shave almost from the first attempt</li>
            <li> Because of the way the heads rotate and pivot not only does it give a better shave then his braun but also shaves his head in minutes.</li>
            <li> It can only give a close shave on the cheeks; or more fleshy and chubby face.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> The second one that was sent to me by amazon was OK though).</li>
            <li> but really only marginally better.</li>
            <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t mind going over the same stubble 10 times or more, my old Phillips was a 1 minute shave if I did it everyday, this thing is 5 times that, way overpriced, it doesn&#x27;t follow the lines of your face at all.  </li>
            <li> The problem I have had and continue to have is that the system \\&quot;thinks\\&quot; there is not enough solution in the solution basin, even when full, and will refuse to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Apparently rinsing well works fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent build quailty, for those who shave every day, dry or wet with sensitive skin, must-buy product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny over the older style electric razors.</li>
            <li> albeit it takes nearly 2 hours to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave and very little irritation!</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Braun series 7 ultrasonic razor which I liked very much.</li>
            <li> Directions for use were not clear as they were directed at many of their razors and not just the one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have not given up on this product because in the long run it is better than cleaning the razor manually.</li>
            <li> In time I am sure the minor irritation will go away.  </li>
            <li> I realize you pretty much get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The whole package is first rate.</li>
            <li> The Philips customer support was awesome and will only encourage me to choose Philips over other brands in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried this model the past few days and it works great and is very comfortable to shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very quickly and it&#x27;s blonde, so I never get a &#x27;5 o&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the instructions were very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> There certainly is residue at the bottom of the cleaner tank when I change the cleaner.</li>
            <li> one shaves close and the cleaning system while not a necessity of life is certainly nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hope to see new better products in future.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor, and I reviewed many other models before choosing this one.</li>
            <li> I have a real tough beard and no razor is perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> Great gift for guys with tough beard.</li>
            <li> For best results: wet blades, use with a non-foaming shaving cream, and don&#x27;t push too hard against your face</li>
            <li> The razor gets a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> When you put it on it just looks like you&#x27;ve applied too much sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze, and it always looks sleek and modern in its stand (in fact I&#x27;ve received compliments from guests on its &amp;#34;sculpture-like&amp;#34; form).</li>
            <li> Saves so much time over manual shaving</li>
            <li> Noisy, needs many passes  to shave smooth, back to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I would recommend this a an \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot; shaver, because the reviews are reasonably correct and the product works well.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for himself, never owned one, and he just loves it, saves him so much time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely LOVES it.</li>
            <li> It does the job and does it very well.</li>
            <li> It seems as though they really thought this thing through.</li>
            <li> I also use a Norelco electric razor when I don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li> Found the SensoTouch 3D on sale on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Not expecting much except a sleek looking razor, I was happy to see it looked like something of an advancement over the tired old design when I pulled it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Norelco&#x27;s for years and found them very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Chest, legs, shaves really close.</li>
            <li> I spent way more time shaving with this one, than the Gillette.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend the upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I also really like about this shaver</li>
            <li> and  keeps the blades ready to go at all times.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Husband is AMAZED at the whole Packaged deal.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over and over areas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after much anticipation.</li>
            <li> Very flexible heads.</li>
            <li> I did not expect the separate charging station, a real plus.</li>
            <li> 1st impression was very favorable when you receive the package and see the care taken to protect and display</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much closer and there is no pulling my hairs out when my whiskers are longer.  </li>
            <li> , I notice when I use this shaver that sometimes it causes the zits to cluster, but when I use a real, bladed razor this does not happen.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really need the cleaning</li>
            <li> I use the razon daily and it does an OK job but not as close as my old Norelco.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few reviews perhaps overhyped how effective the razor would be in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> to have the old Norelco rotary, and while, like the Braun mentioned above, it was just ok, it didn&#x27;t come close to blade quality.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very good - not any different from other standard philips shavers.</li>
            <li> so if you do it right it will be a wash in cost vs razors disposable or semi disposable but its a nicer cut for every day use on sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then all you do is plug-in the Jet Clean system into the power source, and put the razor head down in the Jet Clean system.</li>
            <li> As a life long razor user my husband said it was an easy transition to the electric</li>
            <li> /&gt;it gets the cheeks very fast, but chin and neck take a little longer (like most electric razors)</li>
            <li> Every 2 weeks, remove the tray, empty and clean it, and add fresh fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every 2 weeks, remove the tray, empty and clean it, and add fresh fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the other one I bought for him.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable head works better than other models.</li>
            <li> I have experienced very little irritation or burn even when going over my neck several times.</li>
            <li> got a new Norelco electric as a gift and used it a handful of times only to decide it wasn&#x27;t better than my 10 year old electric.</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit is a big plus to maintain a clean use of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Not necessary need to buy the Jet Clean Station.</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system is a notch above nice-to-have but not a must-have.  </li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I decided on the Norelco 1250X/47 with Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> I use the Jet Clean every 3rd or 4th time of use.  </li>
            <li> lots of ppl said the jet clean system is not necessary</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and shaves closer with much less time and effort.  </li>
            <li> It works fine dry as well.</li>
            <li> When traveling, it would be nice NOT to have to carry the small recharging stand.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to make sure not to press down, move in circles, not move in circles.</li>
            <li> The jet cleaner looks quite catchy , but is very bulky and does not clean any better than what I do with my hand and some water using about 30 secs of my time.</li>
            <li> But expense of new heads Is deterrent!  </li>
            <li> This new Norelco 3D is a world of difference!  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, and often let it go over weekends, but this shaver has never had any issues giving me a nice, close shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, very quiet ( My other one sounded like a lawn mower )</li>
            <li> They say to give a new razor 45 days to really start working well, for your face to &amp;#34; get used&amp;#34; to the razor.</li>
            <li> The razor does a decent job, but I bought this product for the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, relatively painless, and waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to this I had used a Braun for most of the last ten years.</li>
            <li> This particular does not shave well.</li>
            <li> Particularly because you don&#x27;t have to buy solution cartridges.</li>
            <li> The solution it comes with will last quite a while (6 months or more) depending on how often you use and is simple to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The person there told me unfortunately he sees this more and more.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is sad at best and why it only gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> High end performance should compliment a high end price, cause I could got and electric shaver for a lot less but am truly glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product, great shave, I was disappointed that it only lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> Cleaning mechanism is pretty cool but sad that the amount of liquid really doesn&#x27;t give that many</li>
            <li> You should not have high expectations for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a high quality razor for years.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor and the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However; I know he would highly recommend the shaver for</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this type of packaging.  </li>
            <li> If you have a beard, I would highly recommend purchasing the optional beard trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> IT IS PURE SEX COMPARED TO THE OLD SYSTEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend springing the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, since it is a far easier method.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend springing the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, since it is a far easier method.  </li>
            <li> As with all new electric razors, it took a couple uses for my face to get used to it, but it is very comfortable now with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li> and I was having difficulty constantly bending over to clean out my old razor over the garbage can.</li>
            <li> The heads in this model have special slots that grab longer hairs (like a few days worth of stubble)</li>
            <li> Bought this razor set for my husband as a Christmas gift because he wanted a new electric razor and this one got decent reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco electric shaver and this new unit is like going from a Yugo to a BMW.  </li>
            <li> And, according to their site, you have to go thru this discharge recharge deal a few times each year to keep the battery meter accurate!</li>
            <li> would note, that after having tried probably eight shavers over the years, I find that they really are a personal fit to the individual face.  </li>
            <li> If you come from a normal razor blade, your skin will take time to adjust to this one.</li>
            <li> This should only come into play on a long trip as the razor holds a charge for over two weeks, but if you need it, then it&#x27;s one more cumbersome thing to pack ,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get pretty much the same result as when using razor blades</li>
            <li> I am normally a stright razor shaver</li>
            <li> transport process more careful is better, the bottle rupture in the transport process, half a bottle of cleaning fluid leakage.</li>
            <li> The liquid level in the Jet cleaner has to be exactly right - if not it throws back error to you</li>
            <li> ( I actually returned one because although there was no problem with the shaver, the jet cleaner required  a rocket science knowledge to get the liquid level right.</li>
            <li> looked on amazon for a new razor and read about the Norelco 1250xl47 SenoTouch.  </li>
            <li> Twice Norelco has sent me a new one with no questions asked, which leads me to believe others are also having issues with it.  </li>
            <li> But nothing like the new 1250x.</li>
            <li> Shipped in a protected box...arrived on time and brand new just like how you would receive it in store.....</li>
            <li> I pressed against my beard growth, it just would not get as close or all the hair (even with the new foils).  </li>
            <li> I had to pay $89 for a new handle.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t wet shaved with shaving gel, because one of the reasons I got this was to not have to clean up shaving gel all the time.</li>
            <li> first time, It doesn&#x27;t trim very well as it should be for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new one shows how far the technology has come!  </li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system works satisfactorily, but truth be told, it&#x27;s not completely necessary and adds to the total cost of ownership because you have to buy new bottles of cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This razor 1250x is better than all the others ive had in the past.</li>
            <li> This is the first norelco that actually shaves just as close as my mach razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric razor for many years, usually a Norelco or Remington.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I have tried many different electric razors over the years and haven&#x27;t found one that works well.  </li>
            <li> but I was willing to spend the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The razor came without the usual elaborate plastic maze of packaging designed to prevent thieves from stealing the razor at retail stores.  </li>
            <li> My Husband was in complete awe of this thing!  </li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s worth it for the quality, and in the long run still cheaper than a manual razor and blade shaver.  </li>
            <li> the past I had been using a coolskin razor which also gives a great long lasting shave..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as an early Valentine&#x27;s Day gift and he loves this razor!</li>
            <li> and I carefully suck out the clean fluid on top and them dump what is left with all the hairs down the sink and rinse the container with HOT water and refill it.  </li>
            <li> this is the electric shaver I have wanted for decades - it shaves (with shaving cream - wet shave) as close as a blade yet is easy and gentle on skin - you can still use it dry for quick touch ups on the run but the wet shave is by far worth the extra time it takes</li>
            <li> With any new man-toy, he should use it until it&#x27;s completely worn out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The new unit, with self cleaning base and additional charger is great!  </li>
            <li> I got it for a good deal from amazon which brought the total down to like 185$ for the shaver, extra jet wash, and replacement blades already stored away for next year.</li>
            <li> While that really is not a big problem it speaks to the need to fully discharge and recharge about 5x to get the meter showing anywhere near the real minutes remaining.</li>
            <li> The higher end models have features that are not worth the money (e.g., do you really need a five-bar battery indicator instead of a three-bar?)</li>
            <li> After some research, bought this to replace my boyfriend&#x27;s 6+yr old razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor shaves very well and cleans easily,  it actually cleans itself.  </li>
            <li> My husband did not use electric razors because they caused ingrown hair on his face; but has not trouble with this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, coming off Norelco 1150X 2D Sensotouch after I had switched from Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> Night and day difference over my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I cant believe the difference in my old norelco that is like 4 yrs old and is now toast</li>
            <li> What a complete package.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I should preface by saying that I have sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> old and have had 4 electric razors in my life.</li>
            <li> only real negatives I have found are: the model I have, with the self-cleaning unti, takes up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> I have even gone 7-8 days and had nearly a 1/4&amp;#34; beard and this knocked it out.</li>
            <li> His sensitive skin is now being babied.  </li>
            <li> replacement for old one</li>
            <li> I also have a triple head Norelco that is about 4 years old but strictly an A/C shaver.  </li>
            <li> shave is smooth and although it may take a few passes to get all the stubble, man</li>
            <li> So far I have not had this issue with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t quite fixed my razor burn/</li>
            <li> You need to use one of the chargers, since the charging cord does not plug directly into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the jet cleaner is a piece of junk that should go directly to the morgue.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I noticed is that shave not near as close as with my Bruan, I think it because Braun uses micro vibrations, and it really works!</li>
            <li> Have used several times with shaving gel and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> after he used it he couldn&#x27;t stop RAVING!&lt;br /&gt;Instead of grinding his old thing across his face a million times, one swipe does it all.</li>
            <li> I just remember that I could never get the feeling of soft skin that I could get after shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> I get a shave that is really very close if not equal to that of a razor; but I get the benefit of taking the shaver with me wherever I go, and keep it for days without recharging.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It is a very close shave, but still requires several passes on the neck</li>
            <li> Despite replacing shaver head, though, the Braun would still miss some spots, didn&#x27;t give the cleanest of shaves and was outright loud.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> He still uses it frequently though, but I think we will try the Dollar Shave Club for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny especially since I use the electric daily.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a bottle of cleaning liquid but its a joke - wont last for more than a few</li>
            <li> Many years ago I owned a corded Phillips rotating head shaver, and used it until the blades needed replacement, then threw it away because I was never impressed with it and did not think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> good item ,too expensive</li>
            <li> did a quick comparo over the SensoTouch lineup and the only major difference between the various models is the design and finish.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, cuts close and smooth with little irritation and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, cuts close and smooth with little irritation and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more money than I&#x27;d typically spend, but I think we&#x27;ve definitely gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  </li>
            <li> the  He has far less red bumps and irritation and his face is baby smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package it came in was secured, but for some reason when I opened the package I just saw a plain cover with the picture of Philips Norelco instead of the original packaging.</li>
            <li> high price tag decided to give them one last try.</li>
            <li> This takes him about double the time shaving than a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean system also is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It lightly dances across the face - wet or dry - leaving no stubble in its wake.</li>
            <li> The first shave was as close as a razor wet shave in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I had to switch back to a normal shaver to get my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shave is - you don&#x27;t need to apply heavy pressure to your face to get a close shave (BIG change from the Braun).  </li>
            <li> In fact, I normally use shaving gel when shaving with this so that could be the key for me getting a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> packaging comes with the large Jet Clean system, a smaller travel-friendly charger, a travel pouch, the razor, a small bottle of the Jet Clean solution, the charging cable, a small cleaning brush and some instructions.  </li>
            <li> Not really an issue, as long as you clean it AFTER you</li>
            <li> but I point it out because it certainly can be if your space is limited.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I paid a little extra and got the self-cleaning model, for two primary reasons: it was on sale</li>
            <li> but they do work and you only need a new razor every 2 years</li>
            <li> I decided to try a new approach the next day.</li>
            <li> Now know that shaving is also a live technical</li>
            <li> Wish there was an extra set of shaver head - but I can live without that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had to buy a new razor today, it would be this same razor,.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor late in December 2012, because I wanted a complete shave which was smooth on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried it in the shover - not only does it not shave as close, it takes longer to do, so I gave up on wet-shaving fairly early early in the year.</li>
            <li> The razor is not as quiet as when I first opened up the box, but it is still not loud at all.  </li>
            <li> The razor is not as quiet as when I first opened up the box, but it is still not loud at all.  </li>
            <li> went with the 1250/47 model because I wanted the jet cleaning system not offered in the 1250/40, but didn&#x27;t think the extra battery length was really all that necessary in the 1280/42.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m gonna go through all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother?</li>
            <li> all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother?</li>
            <li> Price is some what higher than other products.</li>
            <li> Returned, but not due to build quality...just not for me.</li>
            <li> The blade is as sharp as it was when I first got it, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> It will probably do fine, but I still like the security of the hard travel case.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it is more difficult to clean manually than some other Norelco and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience, it is more difficult to clean manually than some other Norelco and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not coming from foil shaver world with fast motors; my current shaver a ten year old phili-shave (European model).</li>
            <li> The packaging to me is about right as it has an outer box that does need to be cut open due to tape to keep it sealed.  </li>
            <li> So far my husband is enjoying this Electric Razor, he has both dry shaved and wet and enjoys the close shave which he has never achieved with previous Electric Razors.</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, my old one was 8-9 years ago</li>
            <li> When I had my old shaver it would pull the hair, and leave red spots on my neck when I was done with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li> I guess I should try to replace the battery in my old Philips shaver and go back to using</li>
            <li> Speaking for only myself I found the Braun to be the easiest to  use and it delivered the closest shave with no razor burn whatsoever, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a solid device, but it does NOT replace a manual razor for people with sensitive skin nor does it provide as close a shave.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a solid device, but it does NOT replace a manual razor for people with sensitive skin nor does it provide as close a shave.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with in-grown facial hair for years, and within a month of using the product, my face is almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> I think Norelco did this to cut costs and not because a soft pouch was not necessary for protection.</li>
            <li> So based on our friends comments and my checking on line reviews I purchased this product and my husband was delightfully surprised and totally agrees with his buddy !!  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a blade, but because I have sensitive skin and get</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only have 2 complaints:  1) wish the cord would plug directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver is made in the Netherlands and the quality is apparent.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old male, so every so often I still get a zit or two</li>
            <li> you can barely tell that this one is running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other downside is that for frequent travelers, you have to take the charging cord and the stand with you as you cannot plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it as you could with older models.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great razor, but expect to only get about 12-15 months out of it before you have to buy another brand new razor to get the same quality shaver head.</li>
            <li> Battery charges fairly quickly and holds on for about 2 weeks with a daily heavy shave.</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> If I had known that these new electric razors shaved this close without any irritation, I would have done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I always use the shaver after the hot shower and dry shave once face is dry.</li>
            <li> I was surprised of how much juice this little razor has in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could repeat all of the positive feedback from the other reviews of this shaver, but I want to share my recent experience with Philips customer</li>
            <li> That is the biggest issue I have always run into, especially on my neck, so I always use some sort of shaving gel, but it never really helped the irritation on my neck much.</li>
            <li> It does okay on cheeks, but chin, upper lip, jawline and neck results are all poor no matter how I try to move the razor</li>
            <li> One nice thing that carries over is that the razor chargers are compatible so cudos to Norelco for keeping an eye on old customers be that intentional or just a cost cutting attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> particularly like the wet shave option.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance on this because I had one of the older style Norelco shavers that just never seemed to work as well as I expected it should.  </li>
            <li> First shave irritated my neck a little but got 99% of the hairs.</li>
            <li> To me, unless you grow a heavy beard in a 24 hour period, every other day should be fine.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving on the 2nd day IS better with SensoTouch than with a manual razor, but only because I&#x27;m choosing between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;</li>
            <li> Dry shaving on the 2nd day IS better with SensoTouch than with a manual razor, but only because I&#x27;m choosing between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;</li>
            <li> it is awkward at first, but you get used to it very quick.</li>
            <li> At first it took my skin a few shaves to adjust to using a triple rotary system without irritation.</li>
            <li> Worth the trade off for no more face cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> rinse my shaver every couple of days under hot water although they say to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li> This is my 5th Norelco shaver, having upgraded a few times since the first one I received as a hand-me-down from my grandfather.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time with shaving cream and it was just as smooth as if I had done it with a razor but without the razor burn and without the fear of cutting myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors in the past and decided to get myself a new, high tech one.</li>
            <li> I do not love having to purchase new solution once a month as they say is normal to do.  </li>
            <li> But this one can be used wet or dry, and always gives you a real close shave.</li>
            <li> nothing big and still less than I got from the foil shavers since I had to keep repeating the areas so much to get rid of pesky hairs or to get a closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that you can use this wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> (super lazy ) and cant bring yourself to spend another 30 secs cleaning the shaver head !&lt;</li>
            <li> Was concerned that the new head might be fragile since it only sits on a center post but seems well built and rugged.  </li>
            <li> I have only given this four stars because, although my husband absolutely loves this for shaving (and believe me, he has done his research and has even tested it against his existing shaver - shaving half of his face with each one in order to feel the difference!)</li>
            <li> I have used high end Brauns and Panasonics...and previous Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> My other ones, you turn it on and you know it as they are quite loud, especially compared to this one.  </li>
            <li> My older shavers all came with a hard case, and this one has a soft pouch.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use small, circular motions and resist the urge to push the blades too hard against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I highly doubt that it will last as long as my previous ones.</li>
            <li> So, I would expect the battery to really last a long time and Norelco gives you 2 year warranty plus an extra 6 months if you register your shaver online.  </li>
            <li> So, I would expect the battery to really last a long time and Norelco gives you 2 year warranty plus an extra 6 months if you register your shaver online.  </li>
            <li> My main problem is the battery indicator that seems to drop minutes showing after recharge by 10% after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time he used it, I can honestly say we were both a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> In less than five minutes, Philips advised that they would send me a replacement JetClean system along with a pre-paid envelope to return the faulty one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it would have been nice if the JetClean system didn&#x27;t fail</li>
            <li> I think maybe these expensive shavers mostly focus on trying to be gentler instead of actually cutting better.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I was not sure whether I wanted to spend so much money on a razor or not</li>
            <li> It looks like already used a long time as I used only once.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> stars, not 5 because I have not had it long enough to see just how durable it is yet.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it did not fix our marriage problems as sadly, irrelevant of how good this razor is, her mustache growth was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> To make it short, I&#x27;ve used for about 2 months now and gotten more aggressive on my neck which I was afraid to even shave before.</li>
            <li> If she had to choose a side, she would choose the left cheek (which was the dry side)</li>
            <li> as he says, you can do this by just leaving it to air dry as there is no hot/warm air blowing on it in the stand, and as for the cleaning solution, he only does that about once a week.  </li>
            <li> Each head swivels and flexes independently, gliding over my dry face with no friction or irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews referring to the poor placement of the trimmer I think are correct, but its placement works fine for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> While I was a bit wary of paying so much for a shaver, I decided that it was worth it to give it a try, especially with the option of returning it after trying it out for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : daily use causes irritation regardless of wet or dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;does not shave close at all, which is why I am ultimately returning the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately</li>
            <li> I resort to only using the SensoTouch for dry shaving - when I don&#x27;t have the time to do a wet shave OR if, for any reason, I need to shave on the 2nd day after shaving.</li>
            <li> I resort to only using the SensoTouch for dry shaving - when I don&#x27;t have the time to do a wet shave OR if, for any reason, I need to shave on the 2nd day after shaving.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am replacing a Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver that is just a little over a year old.  </li>
            <li> When I put the shaver back in the Jet Clean system, I merely pushed a button.  </li>
            <li> I unplug it at this point so the battery isn&#x27;t charging constantly (not sure if always being on charge will have a negative impact on the battery life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with enough liquid to fill the Jet Clean tub about three times.</li>
            <li> , I find using the base station once a week gets it extra clean, and the quality of the shave is noticeably consistent week to week.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon has it at a reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seems to hold a charge for long time</li>
            <li> He can go days using it and just not putting it in the cleaner to charge, and it&#x27;ll hold a charge that long.  </li>
            <li> skin is not sensitive at all</li>
            <li> Holds an extremely long charge</li>
            <li> There were times in the military when I used a razor but after bootcamp, back to the norelco.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all day long.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit of time to hit the stragglers since it isn&#x27;t made to do that long of hair all the time....</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was really rough on my face and it still missed the areas that were not getting well done by the Norelcos: especially the neck and under the chin.</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than the less expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The closeness of the shave - doesn&#x27;t even compare to a regular razor in either dry or wet shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for the last 18 years, but have been shaving every day for the last three and a half years.</li>
            <li> This razor has cut everything from a thick 3 day stubble to a quick everyday shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you press hard, instead of pushing each plate flat against your face like a good balanced design would do, it instead just pushes the inside of the plates all the way down, so you are essentially pushing the bulk of the cutting surface away from you face.  </li>
            <li> I guess getting a few nicks from the razor is better than walking around with random long hairs that were missed.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary, but it does lube the parts up and offer extra cleaning compared to the alternate water cleaning.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> The razor is very quiet and the blades still seem to be sharp as I am still getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very quiet and the blades still seem to be sharp as I am still getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The charge of the battery is still very long</li>
            <li> The charge of the battery is still very long</li>
            <li> was dry, with about four days of beard growth.</li>
            <li> Dry or with shaving cream</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference compared to the dry shave.</li>
            <li> even dry...</li>
            <li> And it did not come with a brush for dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> It was always a challenge to find a razor that would shave close enough to last thru the day without tearing a few layers of skin off.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> (Prying open the current case would destroy it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried all the stupid gentle pressure and twisting motion tips and again that is just for sensitive folks, I have to really push to get this to cut at all.  </li>
            <li> and that is not saying much because it is not good at that either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry its to rough</li>
            <li> Previously, I could only shave 2-3 times a week,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This brings me to the last subject: cost.</li>
            <li> and you can shave wet or dry...</li>
            <li> here I find that the price of the replacement head would be $98 - or essentially, half the price of the entire razor.  </li>
            <li> This baby glides across the skin wet or dry, with minimum presssure, and seems to massage the skin as it lifts and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I use this shaver to shave my head every other day due to a medical device I must wear.  </li>
            <li> A particular problem with this razor is it gives me a serious case of razor burn on my neck with every shave.</li>
            <li> it two weeks to try and adjust, wet and dry, but it still ate my face.</li>
            <li> I have rather rough skin, so dry shaving didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I will be returning it next week, after one more week of trial :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Series 7 for the past several years and have been overall \\&quot;Ok\\&quot; with it.  </li>
            <li> pretty discouraging and messy to say the least.  </li>
            <li> cuz the other one he&#x27;d had for a long time broke.  </li>
            <li> Although I am still getting used to it, and the shave can be rough some days, overall the time it takes to shave is drastically faster than my previous Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> and I decided to spend a little extra for the gyrating head.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how long the offer will last.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure how long the offer will last.  </li>
            <li> actually chatted with a Norelco rep telling them I would be no longer using their products after I had bought my second 700 model in May of last year and just got tired of</li>
            <li> my sons, who are in the military, swear by it with all the shaving they do....</li>
            <li> SO HE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TO SHAVE TO TRADITIONAL WAY EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> : Expensive (but worth</li>
            <li> But if you shave every day and NEED to shave every day, then it&#x27;s not really applicable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After checking out quite a few different options I settled on the 1250x/47.</li>
            <li> so I spent weeks trying that method to &amp;</li>
            <li> Even tried shaving cream and wet shaving and that seems to help some but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have not used it wet yet but hoping for an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> I always used a Gillette, but then was curious on trying a electric razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if I went over it multiple times, I guess a few hairs were just too stubborn to give away.</li>
            <li> it takes few extra passes around the neck and chin area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it as a wet shaver yet</li>
            <li> This product under all conditions, pulls at the facial hairs, and no matter how slow and careful shaving is performed, the facial hairs are not cleanely cut.</li>
            <li> He had told me he spent $35 five years ago and has never changed the blade.</li>
            <li> I did not use the wet shave function of the SensoTouch).  </li>
            <li> it was rough on the face; this razor seems to have solved the problem</li>
            <li> have a thick beard, and my neck can get sensitive from shaving.  </li>
            <li> Mmmmm, does this mean they will be discontinuing this razor as they did with the last one I bought (actually, they stopped making the replacement razor heads).  </li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade, even those tiny little hairs growing sideways on my neck that all other razors have missed.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Not much over due to Amazon price and</li>
            <li> although I empty the head of hairs every other day.  </li>
            <li> although I empty the head of hairs every other day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions are actually pretty thick for a shaver, at least to me.  </li>
            <li> My husband recently shaved his head and was finding it hard to keep up with the everyday upkeep using regular clippers and trimmers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is not exactly as close as you&#x27;d get with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> other than that a close shave with automatic cleaning</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband since his other Norelco was not doing well.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the SensoTouch design and found that all approval ratings by Consumer Reports and other testing labs to be correct.  </li>
            <li> The other problem is, in my mind, a design flaw.  </li>
            <li> if you are trying to decide due to cost, I could say get it without.</li>
            <li> Had this product in the past, so after buying a Braun that was a piece of junk, went back  to the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Inside are 2 other boxes that hold the shaver and keep it well protected.  </li>
            <li> The other downside besides the cleaning/lubrication solution purchases would be for the head replacement.  </li>
            <li> The other downside besides the cleaning/lubrication solution purchases would be for the head replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re just back ordered from Phillips or if they are no longer being manufactured.</li>
            <li> Also, the pop out trimmer for sideburns is too small, but I only use that on one</li>
            <li> However, buy the Jet cleaner only if you are a lazy dude</li>
            <li> With my Braun I can shave every other day, but with Philips you have to do it every day, and that was a deal breaker for my father.</li>
            <li> I may be biased, but I have been a fan of Norelco shavers ever since my brief forays with Remington, Braun and Panasonic in the past.  </li>
            <li> My neck hairs, never shaved by any other electric, disappear in a flash.  </li>
            <li> I would not trade this one for any other one.</li>
            <li> the other deciding factor for me was the self cleaning stationg that came with the Series 7.  </li>
            <li> The unit just isn&#x27;t built as stout as the other models.</li>
            <li> only one bad thing is that the clean solution is expensive to get some new ones.!</li>
            <li> I have been using a panasonic and was hoping to get rid of the two slight irritation spots that come and go, as well as some harder to reach hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed it did not have a digital screen to show how much time I had left to shave.</li>
            <li> Razor:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months now and can say it&#x27;s not a major improvement over my past razor.  </li>
            <li> I could only clean my Braun in the cleaning base with solution since I could not use water.  </li>
            <li> that it only comes with one power cord but two base stations (the stand and the jet clean system).</li>
            <li> so I did half and half (half dry, half pre shaved) and did the wife test.</li>
            <li> Still went over my neck lightly since I&#x27;ve always had bad burn there.</li>
            <li> the only negative thing is the pop up side trimmer...</li>
            <li> He did not like it, saying it was uncomfortable and tugged the hair too much.</li>
            <li> With the cleaner my only complaint is it makes alot of noise which is within reason</li>
            <li> The only negative is the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be in the travel pouch provided.</li>
            <li> friend has a thick beard and recommended this to me, but it&#x27;s simply not a viable option for me.</li>
            <li> and I am still jumping up and down.</li>
            <li> I was hestitant to buy because of the price, but broke down and bought it for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t see the purpose of the so called &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; cycle as it just seems to suspend the shaver in an upside down position for about two hours.......</li>
            <li> It also was very rough on my face and the neck was all patchy and dried out.</li>
            <li> I was never able to do this in the past because the hair would pull, even with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I was using Gillette Fusion ProGlide disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Also on the subject of recurring costs, they recommend replacing the blades annually, and I expect those are not inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could care less about the style of the shaver, function is what matters.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one we replaced also a Norelco, pretty disappointed especially for the price of the product.</li>
            <li> not give close shave for less fleshy jaws and neck.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight vibration in my hand but heard just a slight hum.  </li>
            <li> I also have not had the irritation I used to get with previous 3 head shavers I have had and the reason why I switched to the foil ones.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor, a Braun Series 5 razor, would shave well, but often leave stubble even after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the predecessor model 3D shaver end of July, 2011 -- less than two years ago.  </li>
            <li> Confusing Jet Clean System; messy, smelly and just plain weird.</li>
            <li> Sometime I get mad and pull out the old shaver whose battery only lasts 20 minutes just to cut those stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> have always used electric shavers, but went with the cheaper ones because I never really thought it would make that much of a difference in shave quality, boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Its a shame such a fine product is soured by such horrible Manufacture Customer Support.</li>
            <li> it is very small hard to get to face because the shaving heads on the top make a awkward angle.</li>
            <li> I have used other electric razors in the past and always buying replacement heads to try to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> A Little irritation</li>
            <li> I do get a little around my neck but</li>
            <li> In the past, he had previously tried other electric razors and was never happy because they didn&#x27;t get a close enough shave.  </li>
            <li> However, it is at least 95% there, and it is far less irritating.</li>
            <li> an aside, it takes almost 2 hours to run down the battery till the motor stops.....strange!</li>
            <li> every few days this will give you the longest life.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Ion batteries dont like to be drained but can deliver allot of power</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I&#x27;ll amend this review if something changes.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> now I shave everyday</li>
            <li> Small bottle of cleaning solution is not  last too long and too expensive.</li>
            <li> Checking the solution level is a messy task and there is no way to add solution without taking it apart.  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this razor I had bought the Braun Series 3 razor and had been using it for approximately a week.</li>
            <li> LOVES IT AS AN EVERYDAY SHAVER</li>
            <li> I use the cleaner twice a week, instead of everyday like it states, because all I get is the baby face Finster beard</li>
            <li> It finally broke and I was tired of paying for the cleaning solution</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not cheap I will continue to use for now but at some point before the end of the year I will probably replace this with something else</li>
            <li> The biggest issue with shaving with this is that, it would just not shave a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> If it was not for the stubborn hairs I would have kept it, but since I still had to use a manual razor to remove a few stubborn hairs, I had to return this.</li>
            <li> ; smell that lingers after a few rounds of use even with thorough cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to waste money on the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Cannot use the shaver close to side burns given the shape - the 3 round blades.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> It went against my grain, but I read a few pages as this thing looks like it came from a sci-fi movie.  </li>
            <li> With a few passes, the razor removed all of the hair, no matter what direction I moved my hand on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The system then cleaned the razor (which takes around 5 minutes) and, while it dried in the unit, charged the razor.  </li>
            <li> While manual razor manufacturers continue their merry one-upsmanship and march toward 6-bladed razors and may eventually hit the 10-blade mark in a few years, I refuse to play into their marketing gimmickry and pay the money they are asking for manual cartridge refills these days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not mandatory if you want to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> The charging unit does not fit into the razor case, which means that you need to have another way of carrying the charging unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m known for always getting people super BA gifts, and when he opened this he was seriously disappointed.  </li>
            <li> if you have kids, bumping it hard, picking it up &amp;#34;to look at it&amp;#34;, or knocking it over will result in spilling all the cleaning fluid and a mess!!!</li>
            <li> the only criticism I have is the beard/mustache trimmer is a bit too short and a bit awkward to use - at least not what I&#x27;m used to from other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> have tried it with shaving gel, soap, plain water...</li>
            <li> First bad experience - the part is not available on their site.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey for some but with price of razors now it will payoff in a few months!</li>
            <li> very  confusing, and I am still not clear about a lot of things.</li>
            <li> know this razor is very expensive, and i really hesitated to buy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad stuf (aka why only 2 stars) - it does not come anywhere as close to a regular razor shave</li>
            <li> The one complaint i have is that when i shave i notice the little shaving coming out and ends up littering my counter area...</li>
            <li> To add to it, it is a serious pain to get it replaced apparently since their warranty is a very tedious and long process.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is too small.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s cleaning it as directed and using it as noted in the product guide so not sure on the problem</li>
            <li> I cannot review the small charger or travel bag because I have not used them yet, but they seem to be convenient.</li>
            <li> This piece shaves so close that the 5:00 pm shadow is almost a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> not sure I would order this model again.  </li>
            <li> I finally got an expensive one, and it is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;pros</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m disappointed, especially considering the cost of this unit.</li>
            <li> It truly shaves as close as a blade, and i have a thick and heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric razors in the past and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> A rotary shaver that is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco Spectra 8831XL in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I usually have it go through the process</li>
            <li> 35 years have passed since I owned an electric razor, and was not pleased at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went from manual back to electric after 5 years of being a manual user, and getting bored of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I am not sure if gel or shaving cream would help or not</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a defected unit or what.</li>
            <li> The system has a small container into which you pour the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> The system has a small container into which you pour the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> I used the razor as lightly as possible for two weeks and was extremely uncomfortable with a red/irritated neck until a week after I stopped.  </li>
            <li> seems excessive for a shaver.</li>
            <li> The neck skin is very sensitive, and was always a little &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, I literally had to start shaving once a week because it was so bad.</li>
            <li> That makes this a very expensive razor, since after one year you&#x27;ll have to toss it and get a new one.</li>
            <li> and so he&#x27;d have these random long hairs on his face.  </li>
            <li> the beard trimmer is a little weak.  </li>
            <li> However, when I had a mechanical problem with the razor less than 3 months or so after purchase and called Philips Norelco to have it resolved, the run around and abysmal customer apathy for their product was so bad I actually considered just throwing it away.  </li>
            <li> Do you have a hard time shaving?</li>
            <li> Just hard to find the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this product, with the exception of teens with bad breakouts, or people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Give at least a week or two to break in the heads and blades.</li>
            <li> I was afraid electric razors wouldn&#x27;t shave close enough or that they would pull</li>
            <li> but since I actually read the instructions (crazy huh???  </li>
            <li> , the one thing he has stated in a slightly negative way is the cleaning stand......</li>
            <li> For me, at least, this is a winner.  </li>
            <li> it works really well and the cleaning charger base is a geat plus.</li>
            <li> But the motor is so damn slow.</li>
            <li> (and if you have an iPad you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I had the chance to use both the SensoTouch and the Braun Serious 7.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with a blade for years, but, had to switch to electric due to an injury to my hand ( couldn&#x27;t shave without cutting myself).  </li>
            <li> I am not only disappointed with the razor but with Amazon&#x27;s misrepresentation of the product.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time between this and the Braun 7 series.</li>
            <li> I thought is was a little crazy to get the cleaning kit along with the razor</li>
            <li> it adds little time to the cutting process, but still works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s poor performance.  </li>
            <li> So I figure I will get ahead of the game and buy the replacement head, using the 15% off.  </li>
            <li> However, irritation did not go away and was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I am confused with the model.</li>
            <li> It was extremely frustrating to get a shave.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse my neck looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it did a fairly poor job on my head.  </li>
            <li> Earlier (2D) models accepted a cord plug-in at the base -- not so on this model.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I used it for a month as directed, but I found that it never stopped giving me bad razor burn and missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> A bit past due, but I&#x27;ve started looking for the RQ12 replacement heads and have found to my dismay that they are either unavailable or they are outrageously over priced, i.e. $98.50 on Amazon 7/13/14!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I was getting a bit disappointed with their missing areas.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used every electric shaver you could imagine, but he&#x27;s obsessed with this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s weird</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use this unless your trying to get rid of a 5 oclock shadow because if you try to shave after not shaving for the weekend it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> cleaner is bit expensive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d even say that it is the closest if not better than a razor!!!!!</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical with the rotary style electric razors because I have owned one before.</li>
            <li> The liquid is a bit expensive to replace all the time though.</li>
            <li> I got tired of losing the battles with razors and cutting my face.  </li>
            <li> But failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves uncut hair between.</li>
            <li> + is a disappointingly inferior shaver</li>
            <li> The shave is close and I never worrry about cutting myself or running out of power.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe it was even cutting the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the fact that all your hair stays inside the cutting head (unlike foil shavers which throw it all on the sink).</li>
            <li> It is awkward to use for some parts unless you have wrap around mirrors.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find here in Brazil.</li>
            <li> i STARTED GETTING BAD RAZOR BUMPS</li>
            <li> for about 5 dollars a month for the cleaning solution, it really isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> you will not regret this purchase...shaves as close as a razor with our all the expense of buying those rip-off razors we&#x27;ve been cornered to purchase at those outrageous prices...</li>
            <li> I was shocked and still am every time I use</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m shocked by how well this shaver works!&lt;br /&gt;i was always a Braun fan... but took a leap of faith and tried this.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed since I don&#x27;t think I can return it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to compare the two products and after having used both must admit I was thoroughly disappointed with the Philips Norelco Rotary Senso Touch.</li>
            <li> but I can say I&#x27;m disappointed with the shave quality I get from this razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and we are really disappointed with this Product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> The stupid cleaning station is a gimmick,</li>
            <li> And even though I have the self cleaning charging base, I cleaned it with water like</li>
            <li> Oh, and the shave was crap.  </li>
            <li> Also, the crap settles to the bottom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always hated shaving-----now</li>
            <li> I used but hated the Razormate Cleaner!  </li>
            <li> Utterly terrible design, not something I can fix either</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product out of the package and got the closest shave I have ever had. I love this shaver. This is the best gift my wife has ever bought for me. It is easy to clean and no taking out the brush heads, just place it under hot water and you can watch the residue run out. I cannot say enough good things about this razor. I have used other electric razors in the past and always buying replacement heads to try to get a close shave.  But this one can be used wet or dry, and always gives you a real close shave. Thank you Philips Norelco for making something that I will enjoy for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is too small.  My last Norelco had a larger trimmer.</li>
            <li> After some research, bought this to replace my boyfriend&#x27;s 6+yr old razor.  He&#x27;s definitely getting a closer shave.  Cleaning mechanism is pretty cool but sad that the amount of liquid really doesn&#x27;t give that many cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would be 5 stars if my boyfriend didn&#x27;t get a 5oclock shadow still *sigh</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  I have no problems with it and the charge lasts forever.  My ex-wife also used it and her mustache simply vanished, unfortunately it did not fix our marriage problems as sadly, irrelevant of how good this razor is, her mustache growth was too much for me.  But a great razor nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It has been a month since I have bough this and I am completely happy with it. I have used many more before this one but this is the one that I actually enjoy shaving with. No pain, No itchiness perfect</li>
            <li> its another great philips razor.but no self cream/gel. dry its to rough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will say they have to many models and way high priced. but they do work and you only need a new razor every 2 years so if you do it right it will be a wash in cost vs razors disposable or semi disposable but its a nicer cut for every day use on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this i can either shave every day or ever 4 days or bit longer and no worries.&lt;br /&gt;even with a razor after 4 days it hurt. or every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge the razor every few days this will give you the longest life.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Ion batteries dont like to be drained but can deliver allot of power Kinda funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun foil razor for about three years now and replaced the cutters and foil numerous times.  It always left stubble, especially between my neck and cheek.  I&#x27;ve fought it for years.  It has a pivoting head that conforms to the contour of your face. So my Norelco arrives today (6/10/2013) and like a good boy, I charge it for the recommended time of one hour.  I shave.  NO STUBBLE ANYWHERE!  A Little irritation but it&#x27;s the first time use of the razor. Wow! And even though I have the self cleaning charging base, I cleaned it with water like the instruction manual said.  Piece of cake.  I could only clean my Braun in the cleaning base with solution since I could not use water.  WHAT A MONEY SAVER this Norelco is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we&#x27;ll see how it goes.  At the moment I&#x27;m in love with it.  After a few weeks I&#x27;ll amend this review if something changes.  But my guess is, after reading all the reviews of this razor, you&#x27;ll not be hearing from me again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and the first few times he seemed to love it but more and more I noticed that it just didn&#x27;t get every hair and so he&#x27;d have these random long hairs on his face.  When he tried to go over the areas again his skin would get irritated.  He&#x27;s cleaning it as directed and using it as noted in the product guide so not sure on the problem but he&#x27;s going to stop using it.  I guess getting a few nicks from the razor is better than walking around with random long hairs that were missed.  Disappointed since I don&#x27;t think I can return it.</li>
            <li> The item was a birthday gift and he just loves it!  The razor gets a really close shave.  The charge holds for days</li>
            <li> I love this shaver it has saved my face its just not natural how much l love it! Do yourself a favor and get one if you need a good shave that is.</li>
            <li> I have some issues most of you are lucky not to have - primarily lymphedema from rad and chemo after my second radical head and neck cancer surgery. There are mornings I get up and give the Elephant Man a run for his money with my swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I actually chatted with a Norelco rep telling them I would be no longer using their products after I had bought my second 700 model in May of last year and just got tired of it&#x27;s poor performance.  I read many of the reviews of the 8000 series and despite of it&#x27;s high price tag decided to give them one last try. As She Who Must Be Obeyed said, it is something you do every day you need to have something that works.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box i was blown away. The first shave was as close as a razor wet shave in my opinion.  The heads have enough rotation to handle the grand canyons of my face.  Being able to shave in the shower is awesome. It has now been more than two months and I am still jumping up and down. I only use the cleaning process - which is smooth and easy to use - once a month relying on just rinsing it daily.&lt;br /&gt;For all of the concern I had on purchase I was blown away by the performance. It&#x27;s nice to be pleasantly surprised with such awesome performance.</li>
            <li> Was as advertised, good price, was prompt shipping.. What more could you ask....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Next time I will buy another $10 electric razor.  Does the same as this way over priced Norelco.</li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  Definitely works better with shaving cream/lotion.  In fact I can now skip a day or 2 and still get a close comfortable shave.  I was never able to do this in the past because the hair would pull, even with a regular razor.  I get a very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband. He loves it. And I love not buying him new razors and blades anymore. 😉 he uses it every day. It gives him a close shave, no nicks, and the travel case is very nice to have!</li>
            <li> Love the razor. It is my second Norelco 3D and I think they have done a great job in making a razor that really works. My main problem is the battery indicator that seems to drop minutes showing after recharge by 10% after a few weeks. While that really is not a big problem it speaks to the need to fully discharge and recharge about 5x to get the meter showing anywhere near the real minutes remaining. And, according to their site, you have to go thru this discharge recharge deal a few times each year to keep the battery meter accurate! Really? I am thinking that the battery and the chip must have a problem and Norelco knows about it as they have it covered in their question and answers section.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, it takes almost 2 hours to run down the battery till the motor stops.....strange!</li>
            <li> I recently completed Norelco&#x27;s recommended 21-day trial for the 1250X/47 razor. Previously, I was using Gillette Fusion ProGlide disposable razors. This is the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, my old one was 8-9 years ago and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, make sure to get Amazon&#x27;s frustration-free packaging. The unit was delivered in sturdy cardboard packaging and it was easy to get everything out and get the shaver charging quickly. Even if you&#x27;re giving this as a gift, get the better packaging for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges in about an hour and lasts for days. No complaints there. You can charge it in the plastic stand, or in the Jet Clean cradle if you purchased a model with the Jet Clean system (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- THE SHAVE --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave I did with this razor was dry, with about four days of beard growth. It was... okay. I decided to try a new approach the next day. I bought a bottle of Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, which is perfect for electric shavers because it doesn&#x27;t foam up. When you put it on it just looks like you&#x27;ve applied too much sunscreen. I ran the shaving head under warm water before shaving each section of my face (cheek, side of neck, chin, etc.) This worked great, and is the technique I continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is not exactly as close as you&#x27;d get with a disposable razor. However, it is at least 95% there, and it is far less irritating. Previously, I could only shave 2-3 times a week, now I shave everyday and I have had almost no irritation. It gives a great shave. Make sure to use small, circular motions and resist the urge to push the blades too hard against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My model comes with a slide-out trimmer. You should not have high expectations for the trimmer. It is adequate for drawing a straight line for sideburns, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- JET CLEAN --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a unit that came with the Jet Clean system. It uses a soapy, lightly perfumed liquid to clean the blades, and you&#x27;re supposed to replace the liquid about every two weeks. It takes about five minutes to clean, so I pop it in the cradle right after shaving and it finishes the wash cycle just as I finish getting dressed. I unplug it at this point so the battery isn&#x27;t charging constantly (not sure if always being on charge will have a negative impact on the battery life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with enough liquid to fill the Jet Clean tub about three times. So, you get about six weeks of cleaning solution before you have to buy another bottle. Also on the subject of recurring costs, they recommend replacing the blades annually, and I expect those are not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- THE COST --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to the last subject: cost. Is this razor worth the money? Well, I got mine on sale. It was $199 on Amazon + a $30 instant credit, bringing the total to $169. As I write the review today, it&#x27;s listed at $219. Also, there are several SensoTouch models to choose from. The higher end models have features that are not worth the money (e.g., do you really need a five-bar battery indicator instead of a three-bar?) The Jet Clean system works satisfactorily, but truth be told, it&#x27;s not completely necessary and adds to the total cost of ownership because you have to buy new bottles of cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, watch the prices, and get it when Amazon drops the price. Also look for manufacturer rebates or instant rebates that Amazon may be applying. You can also get away with one of the mid-range models, you don&#x27;t need the most expensive one. And you can decide for yourself whether the Jet Clean system is worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- RECAP --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Almost as close as a manual razor, with almost no irritation&lt;br /&gt; - For best results: wet blades, use with a non-foaming shaving cream, and don&#x27;t push too hard against your face&lt;br /&gt; - Jet Clean system works okay, but not a \\&quot;killer feature\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; - Expensive, make sure you run the numbers on whether it will be a value</li>
            <li> this is for me the best shaver, i like it a lot!</li>
            <li> great shaver gives a close and quiet shave. jet clean works very well. it seems to hold a charge for long time</li>
            <li> Shaving my beard OK; it is better than my old Norelco at shaving several days&#x27; growth. But, for the huge price I&#x27;d expect everything to be a lot better.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Braun series 7 ultrasonic razor which I liked very much. I decided to branch-out and try a different brand, which led me to an article on Gizmodo about the SensoTouch 3D (this review said that the shaving experience was akin to being kissed by robots). Needless to say, I had to try it, and I&#x27;m certainly glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor reliably shaves those hard-to-reach places like the neck and angles of the mandible, all while barely making any sound! It lightly dances across the face - wet or dry - leaving no stubble in its wake. Cleaning is a breeze, and it always looks sleek and modern in its stand (in fact I&#x27;ve received compliments from guests on its &amp;#34;sculpture-like&amp;#34; form). I will most certainly buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> another gift for my hubby.  He loves it.  It works so much better than the other one I bought for him.  This one shaves close and doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at his face.  Also, the little trimmer is great for keeping his hair trimmed around his neck and ears.</li>
            <li> Another great razor by Philips Norelco..It will take about 6 weeks for you to get your face accustomed to this razor...just saying...the only negative thing is the pop up side trimmer...needs some work...other than that a close shave with automatic cleaning and you can shave wet or dry...gotta love it..;-)</li>
            <li> My sister and I bought it for my dad as a birthday gift.  He loves it.  He&#x27;s retired so he doesn&#x27;t shave every day and this razor does a great job on the different lengths of facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great Razor until you have to replace the shaver head.  Original replacement shaver heads are no longer available.  They will sell you the RQ12+ and say that is compatible, but it is not the same thing.  It does not rotate the same way or open the same way.  The RQ12+ is a disappointingly inferior shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor, but expect to only get about 12-15 months out of it before you have to buy another brand new razor to get the same quality shaver head.</li>
            <li> Best product for shaving machine. I do not have to clean every time.It was pain in the neck. I have been using Norelco Shaver for many years. Price is some what higher than other products. Small bottle of cleaning solution is not  last too long and too expensive. It last only three refill. Should be big bottle like others for same price.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago for my husbands anniversary present cuz the other one he&#x27;d had for a long time broke.  It was a little more money than I&#x27;d typically spend, but I think we&#x27;ve definitely gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  The fact that it&#x27;s self cleaning is awesome.  And the travel case is really nice because my husband and I do travel a lot for work.  He can go days using it and just not putting it in the cleaner to charge, and it&#x27;ll hold a charge that long.  Very happy with this purchase.  Saves so much time over manual shaving</li>
            <li> Shaves well cleans easily recharges quickly. I would buy this again. Comfortable shave, lightweight and easy to handle. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Norelco....</li>
            <li> Runs very smothly and has the cleaning station thats always keep the blades clean. Personaly, I thing the solution lasts longer then a week (~ 1 mounth).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas,as he rarely has time to shave every morning.  He&#x27;ll most likely shave in the evening when he comes home to shower and keeps this in his car to touch up on the way to work.  He&#x27;s used every electric shaver you could imagine, but he&#x27;s obsessed with this one.  A bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth it.  This really gives a nice, close shave and has bevels that glide around the contours of your face, so you never miss a spot! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco sShavers ince the 60&#x27;s.  Old one wore out this one is great. It cleans its self well gives a comfortable shave and does all I expect</li>
            <li> Do you have a hard time shaving? When I had my old shaver it would pull the hair, and leave red spots on my neck when I was done with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;The package it came in was secured, but for some reason when I opened the package I just saw a plain cover with the picture of Philips Norelco instead of the original packaging. So I didn&#x27;t know if it was used or that was the way they packed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impression&lt;br /&gt;When the Philips Norelco 1250X/47 charged up I was surprised of how much juice this little razor has in it. When I turned on the razor I felt it shake my hand, and the razor itself is quiet when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Test&lt;br /&gt;The big test for this razor was when I have not shaved for two weeks, and yet it passed it with a 10 on scale from 1 to 10. The Philips Norelco is just not ordinary razor, this razor will be your best friend. This unit provides the comfort, and smoothness while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;This is the best self cleaning system made, it is easy to use. When you are done shaving, you should rinse the blades of Philips Norelco under hot water, and make sure that there is nothing left in the blades. Then all you do is plug-in the Jet Clean system into the power source, and put the razor head down in the Jet Clean system. Then just turn it on and watch it work its magic.</li>
            <li> Still provides a great shave after more than a year with blade replacement. I like the feel of the razor and the fact that it has a cleaning tank.</li>
            <li> Nothing as discribed. Noisy, needs many passes  to shave smooth, back to wet shaving</li>
            <li> A little disappointed. very easy to get finger print on the surface. It looks like already used a long time as I used only once.&lt;br /&gt;But it is easy to use, and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> READ the book before you try to clean it. NOTE: Be sure you have the cleaning tank PLUGGED in before you try to insert the razor. That actually opens the receiving clamps in the tank.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor, and I reviewed many other models before choosing this one. This razor has done an excellent job as a daily shaver and has yet to show any real down side. Other reviews referring to the poor placement of the trimmer I think are correct, but its placement works fine for what I use it for. The cleaning system has worked well for me and hums nicely in the background. I cannot review the small charger or travel bag because I have not used them yet, but they seem to be convenient. I would recommend this a an \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot; shaver, because the reviews are reasonably correct and the product works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband since his other Norelco was not doing well. This is probably his 4th Norelco shaver. After a few days with this new shaver he said he thought it was the best shave he&#x27;d had with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> good quality. not so quiet. easy use. bought during promotion. value for the money.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves very well and cleans easily,  it actually cleans itself.  It does have to stay in the charger/cleaner all the time.  Works great for me though.</li>
            <li> I knew better than paying so much for a shaver, but I wanted something better.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out my old $50 Philips shaver cuts long hairs way better than this one and that is not saying much because it is not good at that either.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not sensitive at all and that is never an issue for me.  I think maybe these expensive shavers mostly focus on trying to be gentler instead of actually cutting better.  I tried all the stupid gentle pressure and twisting motion tips and again that is just for sensitive folks, I have to really push to get this to cut at all.  I have to go over the hairs, that somehow pop out to 1/4 inch over night, many times before they cut.  Sometime I get mad and pull out the old shaver whose battery only lasts 20 minutes just to cut those stray hairs.  I guess I should try to replace the battery in my old Philips shaver and go back to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the rinsing out with water feature!  That is the only thing I like except that it has a rechargeable battery that works for now.  The stupid cleaning station is a gimmick, better to just clean it under the tap.  I tried both ways, no difference.  I could care less about the style of the shaver, function is what matters.  They should fire the artists and hire better engineers and testers.  their marketing people are great...they could sell anything.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for himself, never owned one, and he just loves it, saves him so much time.  Great prodct</li>
            <li> actually, the razor works fine, cuts close, comfortable, etc.  I am giving it a low grade because it cost a fair piece of change and in reading the user&#x27;s manual, I noted that &amp;#34;after 12 months of use, the replacement head indicator symbol starts to blink...to remind you to check if it&#x27;s time to replace your shaving unit to obtain optimal shaving results&amp;#34;.  So, I go on-line to Philips, after registering my product to get an extended 2 1/2 year warranty and as a by-product, get a 15% off certificate to use at their site.  So I figure I will get ahead of the game and buy the replacement head, using the 15% off.  First bad experience - the part is not available on their site.  Mmmmm, does this mean they will be discontinuing this razor as they did with the last one I bought (actually, they stopped making the replacement razor heads).  I contact their chat function and they provide me a link - to Amazon!  There/here I find that the price of the replacement head would be $98 - or essentially, half the price of the entire razor.  What a RIP!</li>
            <li> purchased this for my son as a christmas present he picked out.  it works really well and the cleaning charger base is a geat plus.</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, very powerful. Now know that shaving is also a live technical</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and he just loved. We recommend this product and we are very satisfying.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor set for my husband as a Christmas gift because he wanted a new electric razor and this one got decent reviews on Amazon. He did not like it, saying it was uncomfortable and tugged the hair too much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely LOVES it. It&#x27;s a close, clean shave and doesn&#x27;t leave nicks or burns whatsoever (with the aid of pre-shave liquid). It&#x27;s super easy to push a button and let it clean itself and I would recommend this shaver to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Directions for use were not clear as they were directed at many of their razors and not just the one I purchased.  This made  it&lt;br /&gt; very  confusing, and I am still not clear about a lot of things.</li>
            <li> Wonderful easy use and clean razor!  My husband did not use electric razors because they caused ingrown hair on his face; but has not trouble with this Norelco.  This razor is easy to maintain and clean with the automated jet cleaner.</li>
            <li> At first it took my skin a few shaves to adjust to using a triple rotary system without irritation. The cleaning unit is a big plus to maintain a clean use of the shaver. With the cleaner my only complaint is it makes alot of noise which is within reason so overall i rather have it than not. I would use the cleaner over water anyday.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Philliphs Norelco after I left mine in another country and have to say that this razor does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, keep in mind and read the instructions. If you come from a normal razor blade, your skin will take time to adjust to this one. It took three shavings to me to work properly and leave my face smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems to work fine. Will update this review as soon as I use the jet clean system.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Products essentially all of my life. I have always bought lower end models. this time I decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did. The adjustable head works better than other models. Also very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> still getting use to it.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very smooth shave. It is also a comfortable shave. Also very easy to clean with or without the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco electric shaver and this new unit is like going from a Yugo to a BMW.  The new unit, with self cleaning base and additional charger is great!  The shave is close and I never worrry about cutting myself or running out of power.  Great product.  If I ever tire of this unit, I will be looking to the newest Philips Norelco to replace.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my father as he always wanted some fancy shaver and according to him, he is definitely enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> Dry or with shaving cream it cuts great! Been using it over a year and still cuts the same.  Iwould recommend and buy again if needed!!!</li>
            <li> The way the info read and the picture was I thought I was getting an 8000 series razor. I am not only disappointed with the razor but with Amazon&#x27;s misrepresentation of the product.</li>
            <li> its not that good. Doesn&#x27;t do very good job around neck areas. I had to switch back to a normal shaver to get my neck.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of mid-priced Norelco razors since giving up the blade in 2006, including the very impressive 8170XL and able AT830.  The 1250x is by far the most wonderful electric shave that I have ever experienced or could hope to experience.  This piece shaves so close that the 5:00 pm shadow is almost a thing of the past.  This baby glides across the skin wet or dry, with minimum presssure, and seems to massage the skin as it lifts and cuts.  Give at least a week or two to break in the heads and blades. The first few cuts may irritate the skin, but after that, the shave is about as good as a shave can get.  The only negative is the price.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried electric razors in the past and wasn&#x27;t happy with them. He has course facial hair and is prone to irritation and he said electric shavers didn&#x27;t get as close or irritated him.  This Christmas I came across this razor and saw all the positive reviews and though, maybe he just hasn&#x27;t used a good electric razor, so I got it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time he used it, I can honestly say we were both a little disappointed. It missed some spots and left his neck with red bumps so I thought I would be returning it but the areas the razor did go over well were baby smooth. So, we read through the instructions again and it said to allow 3 weeks for your face to adjust so he did just that and the results got better fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he is almost 2 weeks into using it and this morning I hear him call out from the bathroom &amp;#34;This razor gives me the best shave I have ever had!&amp;#34; - He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip that might be helpful is that since you can use this razor wet, with or without shaving cream, or dry you may need to experiment with each to see what works best for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Norelco electric razors for many years.  My old razor was having to be charged more often and I believe the battery was getting weak.&lt;br /&gt;I looked on amazon for a new razor and read about the Norelco 1250xl47 SenoTouch.  Even though its a bit pricey I decided I would like to own it.  The razor came in packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.  I use the razon daily and it does an OK job but not as close as my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would order this model again.  I do believe its a good razor but for the money I was expecting a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor, but the jet clean was a waste of money.  He hasn&#x27;t used it and says he has no intention to.  Apparently rinsing well works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neutral on this because I have found that I am not a fan of the 3 blade razor style that this has.  Returned, but not due to build quality...just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great gift for guys with tough beard.</li>
            <li> look no further for a electric razor....this thing has it all....my sons, who are in the military, swear by it with all the shaving they do....you will not regret this purchase...shaves as close as a razor with our all the expense of buying those rip-off razors we&#x27;ve been cornered to purchase at those outrageous prices...this razor will pay for itself in no time...</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised.  I have sensitive skin, coming off Norelco 1150X 2D Sensotouch after I had switched from Fusion ProGlide.  1250x is able to cut more hairs with less passes and is a hell of lot more efficient per shave versus 1150x.  For the price I got it for, it is a good buy.  Excellent build quailty, for those who shave every day, dry or wet with sensitive skin, must-buy product.  Wet shave is most comfortable with Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1250x, even more comfortable and closer than ProGlide.</li>
            <li> I can buy the same thing at walmart.com for 189.95.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to shave my head every other day due to a medical device I must wear.  The razor does a decent job, but I bought this product for the cleaning system.  The system is a good concept, but it does not work consistently.  Twice Norelco has sent me a new one with no questions asked, which leads me to believe others are also having issues with it.  The problem I have had and continue to have is that the system \\&quot;thinks\\&quot; there is not enough solution in the solution basin, even when full, and will refuse to clean the razor. Sometimes I can get it to work after unplugging it, but rarely and eventually not at all. Checking the solution level is a messy task and there is no way to add solution without taking it apart.  I have not given up on this product because in the long run it is better than cleaning the razor manually. I am about to call them again and would guess they will send me my third replacement.  I got this razor as a gift by request from my parents.  I don&#x27;t  have the heart to tell them what a true pain the butt it has become.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. It is, by far, the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned. Although I am still getting used to it, and the shave can be rough some days, overall the time it takes to shave is drastically faster than my previous Philips Norelco. The jet clean system is another great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird that it only comes with one power cord but two base stations (the stand and the jet clean system). Whenever I need to use the cleaner, I have to remove the plug from the stand and plug it into the cleaner.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, but irritates sensitive skin. Must be patient with skin while getting use to this shaver</li>
            <li> nice shave!!! Just hard to find the cleaning solution. Impossible to find here in Brazil.</li>
            <li> My husband received this Norelco 1250X/47 razor for Christmas and enjoys using it every morning.  No complaints from him, therefor it must be beyond great.  He keeps it clean using the jet cleaning system.  This feature has eliminated the &amp;#34;pop the head and blow stubble in the sink&amp;#34; problem I have lived with for many years.  With any new man-toy, he should use it until it&#x27;s completely worn out.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor with jet cleaning system to everyone experiencing shaving clean-up problems.</li>
            <li> Totally 140dollars and it is worth and it is good!!The cleaning systerm is useful!Cause it touch you everday it is better to keep it clean!</li>
            <li> I used but hated the Razormate Cleaner!  If you have or used one, YOU WILL LOVE THE JET CLEANER SYSTEM!  IT IS PURE SEX COMPARED TO THE OLD SYSTEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying that the 1250X/47 is great it is a Norelco!</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this razor I had bought the Braun Series 3 razor and had been using it for approximately a week. I wanted to compare the two products and after having used both must admit I was thoroughly disappointed with the Philips Norelco Rotary Senso Touch. Speaking for only myself I found the Braun to be the easiest to  use and it delivered the closest shave with no razor burn whatsoever, and I have sensitive skin. At roughly double the cost of the Braun I would recommend foregoing the purchase of the Norelco and buy the Braun. It will deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> So far my husband is enjoying this Electric Razor, he has both dry shaved and wet and enjoys the close shave which he has never achieved with previous Electric Razors.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco &amp;#34;triple header&amp;#34; was about 10 years old, and even after a few rebuilds it finally gave up the ghost.  This new one shows how far the technology has come!  Night and day difference over my old Norelco.  Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning system yet, but the shaves are amazing!</li>
            <li> Better than my old self cleaning Braun. But expense of new heads Is deterrent!  Also, solution price is higher! Cost to shave Is higher, albeit better quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, extremely close shave, easy to clean especially with jet clean system definitely worth the purchase. Holds an extremely long charge</li>
            <li> Wow. The best shave ever in 28 years of shaving with all 28 years with norelco razor. There were times in the military when I used a razor but after bootcamp, back to the norelco. This razor 1250x is better than all the others ive had in the past. I always use the shaver after the hot shower and dry shave once face is dry. I may try different ways now. This unit allows a shaving foam to be used. I am cautious about this type of shaving with an electric but it says it works and have read testimony from others on how good it works this way.&lt;br /&gt;Ive always used the norelco after the shower with no problems. I cant believe the difference in my old norelco that is like 4 yrs old and is now toast and this 1250x doesnt compare. The 1250x is superb, close shave and comfortable with the easy clean after use each day with the jetwash. I will update on the wetshave using foam tomorrow to try something new but this norelco takes the cake and very happy with it. Ive never owned the top of line norelco like now having the jetwash to dip into. My last model was the norelco 8160 xl speed xl. This was able to rinse under hot tap water and worked well. But nothing like the new 1250x. Worth every penny especially since I use the electric daily.  I love its smooth shave, close and comfort to a new level. I am so happy with it. I got it for a good deal from amazon which brought the total down to like 185$ for the shaver, extra jet wash, and replacement blades already stored away for next year. Im good and set up for quite sometime now. I couldnt be happier with this shaver. All I can say is go out and get one. You have 21 days to try and if you dont like it return it. Norelco is very good about returns. Reccomend this shaver for anyone. This is the first norelco that actually shaves just as close as my mach razor. No joke. This baby slices around the contours of your face and works better than I ever thought it would work.</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT!!! i STARTED GETTING BAD RAZOR BUMPS AND NOW THEY ARE GONE!!!  tHE CLEANER IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT IS A GREAT IDEA!!! SMOOOOOOOOTH SHAVE WITHOUT PRESSURE!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU NORELCO!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It does the job and does it very well. Then it cleans itself too. What a complete package. And the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like how the listing was specific to the item that was shipped. Item was shipped super fast! Will make a great xmas gift.</li>
            <li> THE PERSON THIS WAS PURCHASED FOR SAID IT IS GREAT . LOVES IT AS AN EVERYDAY SHAVER SO HE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TO SHAVE TO TRADITIONAL WAY EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> Title Says it all. I don&#x27;t understand how this is supposed to even be in the realm of Quality? Don&#x27;t try to use this unless your trying to get rid of a 5 oclock shadow because if you try to shave after not shaving for the weekend it&#x27;s useless. Very disappointing and it was a gift for christmas and didn&#x27;t get around to trying it.</li>
            <li> this is a very comfort tool for me, every day and night keep clean is good feeling, you know it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors in the past and decided to get myself a new, high tech one. I choose the 1250 and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, just to see if it was all that. Well let me tell you it was. The jet clean system is fantastic even though the solution my be a bit costly as are the heads should they need to be replaced. The performance of the razor makes the additional cost of the razor acceptable. It seems as though they really thought this thing through. I wish that I had one years ago now. I work away from home so I have and older one and this home one that I really love. The closeness of the shave is its ultimate goal and it  does that and so much more. High end performance should compliment a high end price, cause I could got and electric shaver for a lot less but am truly glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This razor is great. It gives a nice clean shave. The cleaning option is also nice. It keeps your razor heads clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> As I said, it was my first eletric razor. I´ve never used it before. And I Love it!, In the beginning,  It was not as easy and fast that I thought it should be, but, if you use it regularly, like, day by day, in 2 ou 3 weeks it turns easy to do a nice job shaving and pretty fast. I love the result, as It does a good job. The battery is very good. I did not try yet the Jet Clean station and solution. I did only whashed out with just water, and it stay very clean all the time easily. Not necessary need to buy the Jet Clean Station.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver that i&#x27;ve ever owned, have tried many but this one has may features and shaves me clean!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I have always preferred shaving cream and the latest 3,4,5 blade razor. With that, I still get a rash and burn. I also use a Norelco electric razor when I don&#x27;t have much time. That also leaves me with a rash and skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;I got a new Norelco electric as a gift and used it a handful of times only to decide it wasn&#x27;t better than my 10 year old electric. I returned it and decided to see if I could find an electric that didn&#x27;t tear up my face. Found the SensoTouch 3D on sale on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Not expecting much except a sleek looking razor, I was happy to see it looked like something of an advancement over the tired old design when I pulled it out of the box. The real joy was the next day when I tried it for the first time. Couldn&#x27;t believe it was even cutting the hair on my face. Still went over my neck lightly since I&#x27;ve always had bad burn there. To make it short, I&#x27;ve used for about 2 months now and gotten more aggressive on my neck which I was afraid to even shave before. I have experienced very little irritation or burn even when going over my neck several times. I was shocked and still am every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth shave - close as a blade (or 5)&lt;br /&gt;No irritation&lt;br /&gt;No burn&lt;br /&gt;Fast, easy shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive (but worth it)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do well on longer hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shave and lack of burning face. I&#x27;ve even stopped using cream and a blade. It&#x27;s worth every penny over the older style electric razors. My wife is happier too because I shave more often and it&#x27;s smooth as a blade.</li>
            <li> Great close shave,&lt;br /&gt;battery life is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing if I could find a problem with is the groomer on the back of the razor. it is very small hard to get to face because the shaving heads on the top make a awkward angle.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it did not have a digital screen to show how much time I had left to shave.</li>
            <li> I like it!&lt;br /&gt;The transport process more careful is better, the bottle rupture in the transport process, half a bottle of cleaning fluid leakage.</li>
            <li> As a life long razor user my husband said it was an easy transition to the electric and it does a close shave.  Purchased on the recommendation of a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> it was very good. it came as in good quality as i expected it should be. thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I thought is was a little crazy to get the cleaning kit along with the razor but it was the best investment.  I use the cleaner twice a week, instead of everyday like it states, because all I get is the baby face Finster beard so there is not need for me to clean it every day.  But it woks great and the smell from the cleaning solution makes the razor smell like you are getting a shave from a brand new razor every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I am in the Air Force and need to shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt; From the beginning I noticed it didn&#x27;t do the greatest job at getting all of my facial hair, especially on my neck and around my jaw, but it was quick and overall painless so I carried on using it.&lt;br /&gt;  It wasn&#x27;t long before I had my flight commander in my face after an ORI for not having a clean and perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;This product would be great for somebody who doesn&#x27;t need a perfect shave. It is quick, relatively painless, and waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Norelco&#x27;s for years and found them very reliable.  I was intrigued by the SensoTouch design and found that all approval ratings by Consumer Reports and other testing labs to be correct.  I  have recommend the SensoTouch to my sons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for 20+ years and have found them to be reliable and durable.  This new style razor is very light and takes some getting used to compared to the older one-piece style.  The heads don&#x27;t hold the &#x27;whiskers&#x27; as effectively as the older models.  The cleaning unit works well and is easy to use.  The only other downside is that for frequent travelers, you have to take the charging cord and the stand with you as you cannot plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it as you could with older models.  It does give a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Just as all the info says - it takes 2-3 weeks of daily shaving to get used to it - the only criticism I have is the beard/mustache trimmer is a bit too short and a bit awkward to use - at least not what I&#x27;m used to from other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Shipped in a protected box...arrived on time and brand new just like how you would receive it in store.....cleaner is bit expensive</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor and I wanted it to be a good one. I can&#x27;t complain at all, it&#x27;s a great razor. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. I was afraid electric razors wouldn&#x27;t shave close enough or that they would pull but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how close and smooth it is.</li>
            <li> This thing caused more nicks, ingrown hairs, and irritation than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  Oh, and the shave was crap.  I looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all day long.  I&#x27;m keeping my Gillette razor for now.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a high quality razor for years.  I finally got an expensive one, and it is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;pros: the slide out trimmer works great.&lt;br /&gt;jet cleaning system works amazingly, leaves no hair whatsoever in the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;the charge on the razor will last over a week of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: daily use causes irritation regardless of wet or dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;does not shave close at all, which is why I am ultimately returning the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately the bells and whistles all work great, but the razor itself is a letdown.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best money that I have ever  spent on an Item.I would highly recommend this razor and the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I should preface by saying that I have sensitive skin on my neck. I don&#x27;t know of any scale of &#x27;skin sensitivity&#x27;, so there&#x27;s no number I can assign to it. Best I can describe it is this - I don&#x27;t shave for two days after shaving, because my neck just gets red and irritated. Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very quickly and it&#x27;s blonde, so I never get a &#x27;5 o&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sound familiar to you, you&#x27;ll find this review of great use. But if you shave every day and NEED to shave every day, then it&#x27;s not really applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good stuff - everything about the shaver from the design, functionality and reliability is solid. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and it&#x27;s working just fine. The blade is as sharp as it was when I first got it, no complaints there. The cleaning unit works fine, albeit it takes nearly 2 hours to clean the razor. Not really an issue, as long as you clean it AFTER you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad stuf (aka why only 2 stars) - it does not come anywhere as close to a regular razor shave AND it still irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I know that Philips is proposing its customers a 2/3-week challenge - &amp;#34;shave with this for 2 weeks and it will be the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had&amp;#34;. Problem is - I don&#x27;t NEED to shave every day. I COULD shave on the 2nd day, but my neck bleeds and itches when I do that. And I did try it with this SensoTouch, but frankly the experience wasn&#x27;t worth the pain. I shave every 3rd day and that&#x27;s what I do. So instead of shaving every day for 2 week, I&#x27;ve tried using it for a year to see if the promise of the best shave ever from Philips would come close and frankly, it simply doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave - doesn&#x27;t even compare to a regular razor in either dry or wet shave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - it&#x27;s really good, but not AS good. I tried it in the shover - not only does it not shave as close, it takes longer to do, so I gave up on wet-shaving fairly early early in the year. If I&#x27;m gonna go through all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother? If I&#x27;m in the shower, I just use my trusty manual razor and I&#x27;m done in a couple of minutes with silk-soft skin. I resort to only using the SensoTouch for dry shaving - when I don&#x27;t have the time to do a wet shave OR if, for any reason, I need to shave on the 2nd day after shaving. It still irritates my skin, but it comes in handy and I just suffer through it. Dry shaving on the 2nd day IS better with SensoTouch than with a manual razor, but only because I&#x27;m choosing between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL; DR: It&#x27;s a solid device, but it does NOT replace a manual razor for people with sensitive skin nor does it provide as close a shave. I still use mine and it&#x27;s a good device, but it&#x27;s comes second place to a nice manual razor. If all you want is convenience, get it, but if you&#x27;re looking for the &#x27;world&#x27;s closest shave&#x27;, then you won&#x27;t get it with this electric razor.gh all the trouble of a wet shave, spend MORE time on it and end up with a not-quite-smooth skin, then why bother?

            <li> i&#x27;m shocked by how well this shaver works!&lt;br /&gt;i was always a Braun fan... but took a leap of faith and tried this.  it works GREAT with a wet shave.  i get those pesky under the skin hairs around my neck and this guys cuts them so well that i am amazed... and the next day i have to problem shaving again.  i&#x27;d even say that it is the closest if not better than a razor!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for just under 4 months now and while it has some nice features overall I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I had used a Braun for most of the last ten years. It finally broke and I was tired of paying for the cleaning solution so I figured I would try another brand. After checking out quite a few different options I settled on the 1250x/47. After receiving it I was impressed with it out of the package but after turning it on I noticed it was very quiet and wondered if the blades were turning fast enough to provide a decent shave. I still don&#x27;t know the answer to that question but I can say I&#x27;m disappointed with the shave quality I get from this razor. It does okay on cheeks, but chin, upper lip, jawline and neck results are all poor no matter how I try to move the razor (instructions suggest circles so I spent weeks trying that method to &amp;#34;train my beard&amp;#34; as called for in the manual). A particular problem with this razor is it gives me a serious case of razor burn on my neck with every shave. I have tried to make sure not to press down, move in circles, not move in circles. Even tried shaving cream and wet shaving and that seems to help some but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I&#x27;m disappointed, especially considering the cost of this unit. Since it&#x27;s not cheap I will continue to use for now but at some point before the end of the year I will probably replace this with something else and it won&#x27;t be a Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric razor for many years, usually a Norelco or Remington. Most of them were inexpensive  models, and they all worked adequately. My last one gave up the ghost, and with it being Christmas,  I decided to treat myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this razor is very expensive, and i really hesitated to buy it. But now that I own it, I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money. You get what you pay for, because this is far and away the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned! It truly shaves as close as a blade, and i have a thick and heavy beard. My partner has always refused to use an electric razor because of the quality of the shave, and even he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i can only speak for  my partner and me, but we love this razor, and it was worth the money to us!</li>
            <li> Not only face, but the best body shaver I&#x27;ve tried. Chest, legs, shaves really close. The jet cleaner is motorized, so plug it in first before you try to figure out how the razor fits in.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I have tried many different electric razors over the years and haven&#x27;t found one that works well.  I tried this on and within one week I feel that it shaves every bit as good as a blade.  This is the first electric razor that I am happy with and will stay with.  It may be spendy but with how the prices of blades has increased I feel that overall I am money ahead by using this razor.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor on the market. Everything was simple to set up and use for the most satisfactory and rewarding shave that I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get use to. However, it is a very nice system and is very easy to use. Have not used it wet yet but hoping for an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, I love it, very good, I highly recommend to u guys who wanna good shaver, very good, choose it.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver system. Works great, very nice to skin. The trimmer also has very nice touch. However, irritation did not go away and was getting worse and worse. I had to return it to Phillips though 45 days guarantee program. I am still giving this product 5 star, because the return process was nice and easy. I guess electric shaving systems just not for me.</li>
            <li> I am 52 yrs. old and have had 4 electric razors in my life. Each lasted no longer than 3 weeks because I like the closeness of a blade. I shave my face and my head. It was costing me a fortune in blades, let alone the cuts I would occasionally get. If this razor continues to perform as it has, I will have saved a lot of money over time, protected my skin and have another awesome gadget that works as well as my iPad (and if you have an iPad you know what I mean). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Everything but the actual saving experience was great. Funny huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to shaving, my jawline up was a breeze. Very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet my neck got torn to pieces. It doesn&#x27;t happen with a regular razor or with a foil electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it two weeks to try and adjust, wet and dry, but it still ate my face.</li>
            <li> Value，i love it，Surprise and is looking forward to wait for its arrival, her friends looked say it is value for money, the transport process is long, but for me, is a very pleasant shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto y de altísima calidad a muy buen precio lo recomiendo amplia mente a todas las personas que quieran adquirirlo</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for the last 18 years, but have been shaving every day for the last three and a half years. I always used a Gillette, but then was curious on trying a electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I did some fair searching and narrowed on this. It was shipped pretty quickly, and also came in frustration free packing. The biggest issue with shaving with this is that, it would just not shave a few hairs here and there. Even if I went over it multiple times, I guess a few hairs were just too stubborn to give away. I spent way more time shaving with this one, than the Gillette. One good thing about this razor is, when it shaves, it would be smooth and nice. Cleaning was real easy and simple. If it was not for the stubborn hairs I would have kept it, but since I still had to use a manual razor to remove a few stubborn hairs, I had to return this.</li>
            <li> The goods are very good. These are gift given to my father-in-law. He likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good goods.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and we are really disappointed with this Product. This takes him about double the time shaving than a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean system also is a waste of time and money. You can clean it faster and more effectively without the system itself.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy. If you wanna buy an electric razor still, buy a cheap one rather than this.</li>
            <li> I always used a blade before this purchase to shave. I&#x27;ve had electric razors in the past and didn&#x27;t like them. Amazon had a good deal on these so I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give electric another chance. I&#x27;m really impressed with this electric shaver. I get a nice, smooth, pain free shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco 3D electric razor, it clean my face very well. The prices is very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> Razor:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months now and can say it&#x27;s not a major improvement over my past razor.  A rotary shaver that is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco Spectra 8831XL in the past.  I&#x27;ve rarely liked foil shavers because it feels like they eat away at your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jet Clean System:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not he most aesthetically pleasing piece but charges the razor while cleaning it making it a great-to-have if you don&#x27;t want that &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell that lingers after a few rounds of use even with thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a quick comparo over the SensoTouch lineup and the only major difference between the various models is the design and finish.  I would love to see more powerful motors and blades in the future rather than just a redesign over old hardware.  One nice thing that carries over is that the razor chargers are compatible so cudos to Norelco for keeping an eye on old customers be that intentional or just a cost cutting attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already own a Norelco I really don&#x27;t recommend the upgrade.  The Jet Clean system is a notch above nice-to-have but not a must-have.  If you&#x27;re in a budget I definitely recommend the PowerTouch which seems to be just a remake of the Spectra models.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of months before writing this ti be sure that I was used to the razor and it continued to work as it did out of the box. I can say unequivocally that this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I started with electric about 15 years ago and have owned nothing but Norelcos since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last razor finally expired after seven or eight years and I decided to spend a little extra for the gyrating head. This is no mere marketing gimmick as this razor shaves closer and smoother than I thought an electric could do.  I often go several days without shaving and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. The razor is just as smooth and easy as if I had shaved the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid a little extra and got the self-cleaning model, for two primary reasons: it was on sale and I was having difficulty constantly bending over to clean out my old razor over the garbage can. I only clean it about every two weeks or so, which would be about a week for someone shaving almost every day, and it seems to be working fine.  They suggest every day but I don&#x27;t find that to be at all necessary and recommend you save on the cleaning fluid and stretch out your cleaning intervals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negatives I have found are: the model I have, with the self-cleaning unti, takes up a lot of counter space. It&#x27;s not a problem for me but I point it out because it certainly can be if your space is limited.  The other problem is, in my mind, a design flaw.  While the razor can be charged while sitting in the cleaning unit, if you&#x27;re traveling for an extended trip you will need to carry a stand, as it can only be charged while in a stand. This should only come into play on a long trip as the razor holds a charge for over two weeks, but if you need it, then it&#x27;s one more cumbersome thing to pack ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great razor that produces the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a week now. I had a tough time between this and the Braun 7 series. I primarily chose this because I have heard from many reviews the cleaning system on the Braun is cheaply made and lasts only about a year before it stops working. That&#x27;s unacceptable. To add to it, it is a serious pain to get it replaced apparently since their warranty is a very tedious and long process. I have had used foil shavers before and they worked for me (always had problems with my neck though) I must say I was skeptical with the rotary style electric razors because I have owned one before. This razor has cut everything from a thick 3 day stubble to a quick everyday shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads in this specific model (compared to the lesser 11xx models) are different. The heads in this model have special slots that grab longer hairs (like a few days worth of stubble) it adds little time to the cutting process, but still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gets the cheeks very fast, but chin and neck take a little longer (like most electric razors) it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at grabbing flat lying hair, but does get MOST of it. it takes few extra passes around the neck and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing I also really like about this shaver is the fact that all your hair stays inside the cutting head (unlike foil shavers which throw it all on the sink). After I shave, I open the heads and run it under water for about 5 seconds and most of the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that with rotary shavers, you must go in a circular motion while shaving, and not linear (like foil shavers or razor blades) it is awkward at first, but you get used to it very quick. you can go liner if you like, but it makes a difference when you go circular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it necessary? Not sure. running this razor under water for 5-10 seconds does most of the cleaning. so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary, but it does lube the parts up and offer extra cleaning compared to the alternate water cleaning. for about 5 dollars a month for the cleaning solution, it really isn&#x27;t bad. Compare that to the razor blades you were buying every month. I will just have it setup via amazon subscribe and have 2 delivered every 2 months. problem solved. if you are trying to decide due to cost, I could say get it without. but I was willing to spend the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me talk about the lectric shaver thing I put on the title.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought William&#x27;s lectric pre shave in hopes of even a closer shave. I applied it, waited 15 seconds and shaved. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference compared to the dry shave. so I did half and half (half dry, half pre shaved) and did the wife test. She checked for smoothness and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. If she had to choose a side, she would choose the left cheek (which was the dry side) so it goes to show this razor worked so well that you will get the same shave without any pre-shavers. so don&#x27;t spend your money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t wet shaved with shaving gel, because one of the reasons I got this was to not have to clean up shaving gel all the time. it could be a smoother, better shave if you decide to use it. I have rather rough skin, so dry shaving didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposedly take 2-4 weeks to get used to electric shavers... Well from shave 1, it worked for me. First shave irritated my neck a little but got 99% of the hairs. After that, every shave ended up being good, painless shave. I figure in about a month it will be even better. I did get 1 ingrown hair, but that&#x27;s it. just pulled it out with tweezers, and never happened again (shave 2 I think?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the edge with this, and like me, trying to decide between Braun 7, or this one. I say go and get this one. Give it a try. if not, return and get the Braun, but try this one first.</li>
            <li> One of the best item in market, I really recommend it for everybody. Very comfortable to use and nice finish.</li>
            <li> Had this product in the past, so after buying a Braun that was a piece of junk, went back  to the Norelco. So far so good wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our son for Christmas.  He loves it!  Says its the best razor he&#x27;s ever used! Great Product!</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1250X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean...is a quiet runing razor. It gives a close even shave.</li>
            <li> A great new product from Norelco close shaves charging stand and indicates when cleaning with the included ceaning system is necessary. Includes the proper cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and after shaving with a blade most of my life, I am a complete convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could repeat all of the positive feedback from the other reviews of this shaver, but I want to share my recent experience with Philips customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The JetClean system stopped working after almost a year. I logged on to the regular Philips website and started up a chat session. In less than five minutes, Philips advised that they would send me a replacement JetClean system along with a pre-paid envelope to return the faulty one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it would have been nice if the JetClean system didn&#x27;t fail but these things happen. The Philips customer support was awesome and will only encourage me to choose Philips over other brands in the future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one we replaced also a Norelco, pretty disappointed especially for the price of the product. Thinking of going  back to a razor after 30 years.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Razor, could not be more happy. Nice smooth shave and very little irritation! It is also alot more quiet than the cheaper electic razors out there that wake up the whole household! The Jet Clean system works well and  keeps the blades ready to go at all times. Haven&#x27;t used it as a wet shaver yet but I am confident that it will perform just as well there! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Quiet and effective for a close shave that rivals a blade. Sale price and I don&#x27;t have to waste money on the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Product has been really effective. I have had problems with in-grown facial hair for years, and within a month of using the product, my face is almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> While I was a bit wary of paying so much for a shaver, I decided that it was worth it to give it a try, especially with the option of returning it after trying it out for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used electric shavers, but went with the cheaper ones because I never really thought it would make that much of a difference in shave quality, boy was I wrong! I have a very heavy beard, and often let it go over weekends, but this shaver has never had any issues giving me a nice, close shave, without irritation. That is the biggest issue I have always run into, especially on my neck, so I always use some sort of shaving gel, but it never really helped the irritation on my neck much. With this shaver, and using the Nivea for men shaving gel, there is almost no irritation any more.&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to go with the jet clean system, based on the idea that it is supposed to help keep the blades cleaner and sharper longer. I have not had the shaver long enough to report on the sharpness claim, but it does a great job of keeping the shaving heads clean. I usually have it go through the process every 2 or 3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this appears to be a great product, as long as you are willing to make the investment in a fairly pricey system. There are way more expensive ones out there, and of course, cheaper shavers, but I think this one hits the sweet spot in between, and gives a great shave for your investment.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars, not 5 because I have not had it long enough to see just how durable it is yet. I will revise my rating as warranted as time goes on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I used an electric razor and WOW, this works amazingly!!! Something I never knew, but since I actually read the instructions (crazy huh???  lol) I learned that the key is to stick with it and use circles. Don&#x27;t swap between razor and electric because your face adjusts to them differently and you get a much better shave after a week or so of just using the Electric razor. I have even gone 7-8 days and had nearly a 1/4&amp;#34; beard and this knocked it out. It took a bit of time to hit the stragglers since it isn&#x27;t made to do that long of hair all the time.... but I was seriously impressed!!!  I love the jet clean too. The liquid is a bit expensive to replace all the time though. Empty your razor and blow it out really good or rinse it good with HOT water and it will stay clean longer. Also, the crap settles to the bottom. Being a nurse, I brought home a 60cc catheter tip syringe and I carefully suck out the clean fluid on top and them dump what is left with all the hairs down the sink and rinse the container with HOT water and refill it.  Works great!!!  Caution: if you have kids, bumping it hard, picking it up &amp;#34;to look at it&amp;#34;, or knocking it over will result in spilling all the cleaning fluid and a mess!!!</li>
            <li> Short an simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband is AMAZED at the whole Packaged deal.  His sensitive skin is now being babied.  He is no longer breaking out.  And he loves how it cleans.  He is a Gadget Guy.  And it does alot more than a PERFECT shave.  He don&#x27;t know what I paid and has said don&#x27;t tell him...yep, pricy but per him.  It&#x27;s the best one he has EVER owned.  He just turned 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a trip!</li>
            <li> Any body knows the difference between 1250X/47 and 1250cc/42? I am confused with the model. When you choose the retail package, Amason will send you a 1250cc/42 model.</li>
            <li> I have tried this model the past few days and it works great and is very comfortable to shave.  I have not tried to jet clean yet.  But I assume it will work fine.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this razor a shot, as it had great reviews; however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick for me.  I used it for a month as directed, but I found that it never stopped giving me bad razor burn and missing hairs.  I&#x27;ve since returned to using my Merker Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor - surprisingly close shave, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean. Holds a charge forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With electric razors, you always get what you pay for, and while the SensoTouch razors may be a tad pricy, you&#x27;ll know exactly where your money went. I&#x27;m very happy with mine.</li>
            <li> Pluses&lt;br /&gt;+ Love the frustration free packaging&lt;br /&gt;+ Close shave almost from the first attempt&lt;br /&gt;+ Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses&lt;br /&gt;- I need to read a stinkin&#x27; manual to shave?&lt;br /&gt;- Confusing Jet Clean System; messy, smelly and just plain weird. Worked erratically and had blinking symbols that made you refer the manual to know what the heck is going on&lt;br /&gt;- Showed me 3 blinking symbols every time I tried to recharge - checked the manual even the website for the rosetta stone that could help with Norelco to English. No luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Gave up after 3 days of trying to get it to recharge and returned it to Amazon</li>
            <li> Easy to use with Gel and with cleaning liquid its one touch cleaning.  I love this product.  Hope to see new better products in future.</li>
            <li> It was nice to get updated in electric razors!  I shopped all of the web sites to find the best price !!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband recently shaved his head and was finding it hard to keep up with the everyday upkeep using regular clippers and trimmers.  Because of the way the heads rotate and pivot not only does it give a better shave then his braun but also shaves his head in minutes. It also is wet or dry.  This combination  package gives you all the extras you need.</li>
            <li> The closest shaving rotary razor I have ever owned. I would definitely recommend this product to other people. Easy to use and I enjoy the jet cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I got tired of losing the battles with razors and cutting my face.  My options were to try an electric razor or grow another beard.  35 years have passed since I owned an electric razor, and was not pleased at the time.&lt;br /&gt;  After reading several reviews, I decided on the Norelco 1250X/47 with Jet Clean. After using it for a while here are my comments;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide a fairly close shave and is easy on the face. Worth the trade off for no more face cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, just rinse under warm water and let dry. I use the Jet Clean every 3rd or 4th time of use.  I think it helps to lubricate it. Another stand for the razor when it is drying from just rinsing with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is the not a selling point for me.  It is awkward to use for some parts unless you have wrap around mirrors. Biggest draw back for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and would recommend it.  Ask again after I have to replace to razor parts in about a year.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for a long time.  But I was getting a bit disappointed with their missing areas.  So about a year ago I bought a Panasonic ES8109 based on the good reviews on Amazon.  It was really rough on my face and it still missed the areas that were not getting well done by the Norelcos: especially the neck and under the chin. It also was very rough on my face and the neck was all patchy and dried out. Finally this year my wife got me this SensoTouch 3d 1250x40 and it really does the trick. It is fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over and over areas.  It is easy on your skin.  It cleans easily, either using  hot water from the tap or the cleaning stand.  It feels a lot better. I find the trimmer easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> replacement for old one</li>
            <li> I bought this product after much anticipation. But failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is hi-tech, but does not serve the purpose as advertised. It can only give a close shave on the cheeks; or more fleshy and chubby face. This may work for (no pun intented) people with more fleshy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot perform a clean cut / shave for side burns - even with the trimmer. Cannot use the shaver close to side burns given the shape - the 3 round blades.&lt;br /&gt;Does not give close shave for less fleshy jaws and neck. Leaves uncut hair between. (I have noticed some people walking around like this and now I am thinking that they may be using this or similar products!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I have to use my old fashioned shaving set to make sure I have a clean shave and I can shave my side burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not working for me. As mentioned in manual I tried and waited for more than a month for the skin to get adjusted. I will be returning it next week, after one more week of trial :(</li>
            <li> This particular does not shave well. This product under all conditions, pulls at the facial hairs, and no matter how slow and careful shaving is performed, the facial hairs are not cleanely cut.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he has raved at how well this razor works.  Easy to use and clean for a nice close shave ;)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the instructions were very simple and easy to use. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t mind going over the same stubble 10 times or more, my old Phillips was a 1 minute shave if I did it everyday, this thing is 5 times that, way overpriced, it doesn&#x27;t follow the lines of your face at all.  If you press hard, instead of pushing each plate flat against your face like a good balanced design would do, it instead just pushes the inside of the plates all the way down, so you are essentially pushing the bulk of the cutting surface away from you face.  Utterly terrible design, not something I can fix either, it either needs independent springs on the inside portion of each plate, or rework the entire design to where each plate truly has an independent suspension</li>
            <li> I like the product for the style. first time, It doesn&#x27;t trim very well as it should be for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for shaving it is excellent. so if you have to have another machine for trimming beside.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say, wet or dry, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had. This unit rocks! I went from manual back to electric after 5 years of being a manual user, and getting bored of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note, while you can just rinse out the unit with tap water, I find using the base station once a week gets it extra clean, and the quality of the shave is noticeably consistent week to week.</li>
            <li> I love this electric razor it does the job and more. I would recommend it to everyone. A little pricey for some but with price of razors now it will payoff in a few months!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a great, smooth shave, with no nicks or cuts like my razor blade did used to.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, Easy to clean. Very flexible heads. This is the best design so far from Norelco! This is the best price of all for what your getting. I did not expect the separate charging station, a real plus. I have a real tough beard and no razor is perfect for my face. but this does a real good job of being smooth and close. This is replacing my Norelco Speed-8160XL which is still working good, but wanted to have state of the art as my current razor is approx 4 years old. I have tried the foil razors and always receive a cut under the chin. This new razor has a real nice glide to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so accurate when shaving. I get pretty much the same result as when using razor blades</li>
            <li> If I had known that these new electric razors shaved this close without any irritation, I would have done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am replacing a Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver that is just a little over a year old.  That razor replaced a similar one that I had for several years.  Both of these are microscreens and not 3 head rotary. I also have a triple head Norelco that is about 4 years old but strictly an A/C shaver.  That being said, my review is based on owning those, which by the way, all work pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this shaver for about a week and I am very impressed.  The packaging to me is about right as it has an outer box that does need to be cut open due to tape to keep it sealed.  Inside are 2 other boxes that hold the shaver and keep it well protected.  1st impression was very favorable when you receive the package and see the care taken to protect and display shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are actually pretty thick for a shaver, at least to me.  It went against my grain, but I read a few pages as this thing looks like it came from a sci-fi movie.  Now again, I am comparing to the foil shavers I own and the standard corded triple head rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it up and used it the next morning.  When I pushed the on/off button, I had to check to see if it was on.  I felt a slight vibration in my hand but heard just a slight hum.  My other ones, you turn it on and you know it as they are quite loud, especially compared to this one.  I touched my face with this Senso Touch 3D and I could now hear my stubble in the blades.  This shaver is so quiet and fits your hand well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is smooth and although it may take a few passes to get all the stubble, man i have never felt my face so smooth.  Seriously.  My wife was quite impressed too as the other shavers, no matter the angle or how hard/soft I pressed against my beard growth, it just would not get as close or all the hair (even with the new foils).  So far I have not had this issue with this shaver.  I also have not had the irritation I used to get with previous 3 head shavers I have had and the reason why I switched to the foil ones.  I do get a little around my neck but nothing big and still less than I got from the foil shavers since I had to keep repeating the areas so much to get rid of pesky hairs or to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book states it could take about 3 weeks to get used to it and for your face to become accustomed but I notice and felt a difference immediately.  In time I am sure the minor irritation will go away.  I am not sure if gel or shaving cream would help or not but that is another nice touch on how you can use this razor.  It does allow you to shave with gel/shaving cream as if it were a standard razor.  I cannot comment on how well it works, but many reviewers have and can tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse my shaver every couple of days under hot water although they say to do it everyday.  To me, unless you grow a heavy beard in a 24 hour period, every other day should be fine.  I have not used the cleaning/lubrication solution yet, but love the idea.  I do not love having to purchase new solution once a month as they say is normal to do.  At least Amazon has it at a reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, talking on cost.  I admit I am pretty cheap when it comes to buying items like this.  I have always payed well under a $100 for my shavers and this one was the firat I paid over a $100 for.  Not much over due to Amazon price and a $50 off special going on as we speak.  Was it worth it?  YES.  I realize you pretty much get what you pay for and although I cannot see paying over $200 for a shaver as I cannot seeing it being that much better (though MSRP is $250 on this one) unless it puts velvet protector betweeen shaver and your face.  Even in comparing with the higher priced Norelco shavers in the comparison chart, this one seems to be best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides if you count them as such is non replaceable battery.  But hell, Ipad and Android tablet batteries cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.  So, I would expect the battery to really last a long time and Norelco gives you 2 year warranty plus an extra 6 months if you register your shaver online.  The other downside besides the cleaning/lubrication solution purchases would be for the head replacement.  @ $60 each year for recommended replacement time frame.  But if this shaver performs this well in a year or two like it does now, the costs and downsides will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, a very good shaver, worth the 5 stars.  It is quiet, cuts close and smooth with little irritation and highly recommend it.  If you are on the fence on this, the extra $50 off coupon is what helped with my decision but I am not sure how long the offer will last.  The coupon is good for other comparable models too.  Hope this review helps you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/18/2013 Update:  Ok, I have had this razor for about 4 months and here is my update:  The razor is not as quiet as when I first opened up the box, but it is still not loud at all.  The razor is very quiet and the blades still seem to be sharp as I am still getting a close shave.  The cleansing of the razor I do about once a week using the Jet Clean System although I empty the head of hairs every other day.  The charge of the battery is still very long and I charge it about once every 2 weeks just to do it.  I am still very happy with this razor and feel it was worth the price I paid.ies cannot be replaced either and a person uses those much more than a shaver.

            <li> This product worked great and price was really affordable as well.  My husband loved it so much, and use it all the time.  Very easy to use and a very nice features.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> so I think it fits me quite well. I really like it! Great beginning of every day! Best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My husband had been hinting around at this for some time. I was hestitant to buy because of the price, but broke down and bought it for a Christmas gift. Glad I did and he is happy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband.  He really likes it.  Certainly makes it easy for him to stay clean shaven regularly.</li>
            <li> Norelco 1250X47 with Jet Clean System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always hated shaving-----now I almost look forward to it!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love the jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks----great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it continues to produce these results in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th Norelco shaver, having upgraded a few times since the first one I received as a hand-me-down from my grandfather. I like the product line, and I never have and any problems with these shavers. This one is the same. It works well and does the job. I like the ability to wet-shave when I want to. It takes a bit longer to finish the job, but, it actually delivers quite a close shave. It works fine dry as well. The cleaning system seems to do the job well, although I notice a lingering odor on the shaver when I shave. It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but I notice it. There certainly is residue at the bottom of the cleaner tank when I change the cleaner. So, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working. My only complaint would be in the travel pouch provided. My older shavers all came with a hard case, and this one has a soft pouch. I think Norelco did this to cut costs and not because a soft pouch was not necessary for protection. It will probably do fine, but I still like the security of the hard travel case.</li>
            <li> I have only given this four stars because, although my husband absolutely loves this for shaving (and believe me, he has done his research and has even tested it against his existing shaver - shaving half of his face with each one in order to feel the difference!), the one thing he has stated in a slightly negative way is the cleaning stand...... he doesn&#x27;t see the purpose of the so called &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; cycle as it just seems to suspend the shaver in an upside down position for about two hours....... as he says, you can do this by just leaving it to air dry as there is no hot/warm air blowing on it in the stand, and as for the cleaning solution, he only does that about once a week.  In between, he just cleans it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However; I know he would highly recommend the shaver for it&#x27;s excellent performance and speed of use - a good shave within 3 minutes and an excellent shave in about 5 minutes and very little &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but I wanted to say that this is the best electric razor I have ever used. I tried it today for the first time with shaving cream and it was just as smooth as if I had done it with a razor but without the razor burn and without the fear of cutting myself</li>
            <li> This electric razor was a Christmas (2012) gift for my husband and he loves it !!  In the past, he had previously tried other electric razors and was never happy because they didn&#x27;t get a close enough shave.  I purchased this product because of a friend who has one and he was very impressed with the movement of the blades, closeness of the shave and the way it cleans the blades between uses.  So based on our friends comments and my checking on line reviews I purchased this product and my husband was delightfully surprised and totally agrees with his buddy !!  GREAT RAZOR !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well built and all. But the motor is so damn slow. It was extremely frustrating to get a shave. I am not coming from foil shaver world with fast motors; my current shaver a ten year old phili-shave (European model). And its motor is faster than this. I am not sure if I got a defected unit or what. But I decided to return it. I will probably give Braun or Panasonic a try.</li>
            <li> lots of ppl said the jet clean system is not necessary&lt;br /&gt;I missed the special offer while this has a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;so this package is also a good option for me.&lt;br /&gt;why not, just less than 20 bux for an additional accessory.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in November, 2012. A bit past due, but I&#x27;ve started looking for the RQ12 replacement heads and have found to my dismay that they are either unavailable or they are outrageously over priced, i.e. $98.50 on Amazon 7/13/14! I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re just back ordered from Phillips or if they are no longer being manufactured. I&#x27;ll wait a while and check again, but in the meantime I would suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> The razor requires replacement heads once a year.  However after one year from purchase, the replacement head for the razor has been discontinued and there is no replacement.  That makes this a very expensive razor, since after one year you&#x27;ll have to toss it and get a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this two years ago and it is still going strong. I thought that the Jet Clean System would be a gimmick but it seams to actually help with the blades. I charge the razor once per week and have never run low on energy.</li>
            <li> This is nice shaver. I used it over one year.</li>
            <li> good item ,too expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 electric shavers in my lifetime. I recently switched to shaving with a blade, but because I have sensitive skin and get razor burn/ingrown hairs easily, I wanted to try electric again. Deciding to go top notch, I chose this model. I like it because you can use it in the shower, with shaving cream and it works well. It hasn&#x27;t quite fixed my razor burn/ingrown hair problem, which ends up looking like pimples. It gives you a close close close shave, but I think so close that if you get ingrown hairs/razor burn... might be too close. As I continue to use this product I will update my review, but if you have any tips or tricks to share, let me know. I&#x27;m using all different types of shaving cream, foam works best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor late in December 2012, because I wanted a complete shave which was smooth on the skin.  My previous razor, a Braun Series 5 razor, would shave well, but often leave stubble even after cleaning.  A friend who took the razor and cleaned it by hand found it worked well afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I received the razor in frustration-free packaging.  I highly recommend this type of packaging.  The razor came without the usual elaborate plastic maze of packaging designed to prevent thieves from stealing the razor at retail stores.  Instead, packaging is a set of plastic bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging comes with the large Jet Clean system, a smaller travel-friendly charger, a travel pouch, the razor, a small bottle of the Jet Clean solution, the charging cable, a small cleaning brush and some instructions.  You need to use one of the chargers, since the charging cord does not plug directly into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I put the razor in the Jet Cleaning system, to recharge overnight (it does both), I used it the next morning.  The razor felt smooth on my skin.  With a few passes, the razor removed all of the hair, no matter what direction I moved my hand on my skin.  My skin felt smooth and had no rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glides easily over problem areas on my neck as well, leaving all of my neck smooth shaved.  Shaving the mustache area also went well.  When I put the shaver back in the Jet Clean system, I merely pushed a button.  The system then cleaned the razor (which takes around 5 minutes) and, while it dried in the unit, charged the razor.  The charging shuts off when the razor is full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks, the shaving has continued to be excellent.  It would be nice if the razor could shave me so smooth in 1 pass, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor does that.  Also, the pop out trimmer for sideburns is too small, but I only use that on one area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on travel, there are instructions on how to clean the razor manually.  This requires popping the covers off the three independent razor heads.  In my experience, it is more difficult to clean manually than some other Norelco and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend springing the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, since it is a far easier method.  The system has a small container into which you pour the cleaning solution.  Every 2 weeks, remove the tray, empty and clean it, and add fresh fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while the razor is itself costly, and the replacement blades are costly, it does an excellent job shaving.on how to clean the razor manually.

            <li> No tenia una afeitadora asi antes, hasta que me decidi en comprar esta, y no me arrepiento es excelente, la afeitada es comoda, y el resultada muy bueno. Y esta que venia con la estacion de limpieza es genial.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very good - not any different from other standard philips shavers. Does not replace a razor blade, but better than most of the electric shavers out there. Battery charges fairly quickly and holds on for about 2 weeks with a daily heavy shave. Battery Indicator is a useful bonus. Comes with a nice looking pouch and 2 sets of chargers. Wish there was an extra set of shaver head - but I can live without that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the jet cleaner is a piece of junk that should go directly to the morgue. The jet cleaner looks quite catchy , but is very bulky and does not clean any better than what I do with my hand and some water using about 30 secs of my time. The liquid level in the Jet cleaner has to be exactly right - if not it throws back error to you ( I actually returned one because although there was no problem with the shaver, the jet cleaner required  a rocket science knowledge to get the liquid level right. The second one that was sent to me by amazon was OK though). Comes with a bottle of cleaning liquid but its a joke - wont last for more than a few cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the shaver. However, buy the Jet cleaner only if you are a lazy dude (super lazy ) and cant bring yourself to spend another 30 secs cleaning the shaver head !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for the speedy exchange -- thats why I buy at amazon !</li>
            <li> My Husband was in complete awe of this thing!  He stared at it and could not believe all the things it did.  And he just LOVED LOVED it when he used it!  GREAT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this, for my father just to try and see if it works better that my Bruan 7 series, it did not. It gave me a big irritation on my neck I had it for three days, ouch! Another thing that I noticed is that shave not near as close as with my Bruan, I think it because Braun uses micro vibrations, and it really works! With my Braun I can shave every other day, but with Philips you have to do it every day, and that was a deal breaker for my father. It looks awesome and quiet but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric razor that shaves as good or better than a razor.  This one does! I am totally satisfied with my purchase,</li>
            <li> Asked for this as a Christmas gift after my Braun 3 Series finally gave up the ghost.  Did a fair amount of research prior to buying, so I was pretty comfortable this would fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shave is - you don&#x27;t need to apply heavy pressure to your face to get a close shave (BIG change from the Braun).  As with all new electric razors, it took a couple uses for my face to get used to it, but it is very comfortable now with little or no irritation.  Battery life is outstanding.  Also, the self-cleaning mechanism is better than the Braun.  Particularly because you don&#x27;t have to buy solution cartridges. The solution it comes with will last quite a while (6 months or more) depending on how often you use and is simple to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the wet shave option.  Have used several times with shaving gel and it works very well.  This is especially handy for 2 day beards when you know it&#x27;s going to be a rough shave.  On that subject, I was very happy with the ability to handle a longer beard.  Took care of 3 day stubble with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have 2 complaints:  1) wish the cord would plug directly into the shaver. For travel, it&#x27;s a jigsaw puzzle to get the shaver, cord, and charging stand into the travel pouch.  2) the beard trimmer is a little weak.  Takes 3-4 passes to get sideburn and neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great shaver.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Norelco out did itself this time. This thing gives a great shave..feels good in my hand ..is quiet....I love it.</li>
            <li> This is great shaver. I shaved with a blade for years, but, had to switch to electric due to an injury to my hand ( couldn&#x27;t shave without cutting myself).  Got a Braun, but, didn&#x27;t like the feel. Switched to this Norelco and is so nice.  Shaves smooth and the cleaning system is very handy.</li>
            <li> It was everything that I have come to expect in a Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> cuts very close and is easy to operate,cleans itself well in the cleaning station,easy to figure out, charges quickly, have not seen a better price.</li>
            <li> So I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I&#x27;m known for always getting people super BA gifts, and when he opened this he was seriously disappointed.  &amp;#34;I already HAVE a perfectly fine shaver!&amp;#34; Umm no. He had told me he spent $35 five years ago and has never changed the blade. That&#x27;s a guy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then after he used it he couldn&#x27;t stop RAVING!&lt;br /&gt;Instead of grinding his old thing across his face a million times, one swipe does it all. He loves the  He has far less red bumps and irritation and his face is baby smooth. He said the pivoting head makes a huge amount of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with the 1250/47 model because I wanted the jet cleaning system not offered in the 1250/40, but didn&#x27;t think the extra battery length was really all that necessary in the 1280/42. There was also a manufacturer coupon that took this from $200 to $100 so I was super excited about that too!</li>
            <li> I bought it because the big discount, It is a gift, I hope it will work good and easy to clean</li>
            <li> While manual razor manufacturers continue their merry one-upsmanship and march toward 6-bladed razors and may eventually hit the 10-blade mark in a few years, I refuse to play into their marketing gimmickry and pay the money they are asking for manual cartridge refills these days. I may be biased, but I have been a fan of Norelco shavers ever since my brief forays with Remington, Braun and Panasonic in the past.  And this is the best Norelco shaver and, therefore, the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  It is the quietest shaver I have ever had and it is giving me the closest shaves, even without shaving cream (which you can use if you want with this model).  Each head swivels and flexes independently, gliding over my dry face with no friction or irritation at all.  The unit is so easy to clean by just running it under water.  But it is the automatic cleaning/charging unit and cleaning solution which make this package a cut above the rest.  Everything works flawlessly. If you have a beard, I would highly recommend purchasing the optional beard trimmer attachment. The shaver is made in the Netherlands and the quality is apparent.</li>
            <li> I have a 7 series and just received this 1250 Norelco.  I like the Norelco a lot more.  The shave is much closer and there is no pulling my hairs out when my whiskers are longer.  I have been using the Braun 7 series about a year and I do like it for the top of my head.  The Braun seems to handle my scalp better, but again the Norelco is by far a better face shave.  It could be that I just need to get used to shaving my head with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got this product. The neck skin is very sensitive, and was always a little &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, I literally had to start shaving once a week because it was so bad. With this product the skin is calm and shaving is actually fun again. I like the Jet clean system, it&#x27;s a neat gimmick but to be honest it&#x27;s not mandatory if you want to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! love that it is water proof. Previously used Braun and am happy I switched. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Many years ago I owned a corded Phillips rotating head shaver, and used it until the blades needed replacement, then threw it away because I was never impressed with it and did not think it was worth the money. I just remember that I could never get the feeling of soft skin that I could get after shaving with a razor. 20 years later, I gave this another try, and it truly is improved remarkably. I get a shave that is really very close if not equal to that of a razor; but I get the benefit of taking the shaver with me wherever I go, and keep it for days without recharging. The jet cleaner device is also nice, although the only thing it does is dipping the shaver blades in the solution and running it. If you want to save money, you could buy a model without the automatic cleaner, and just buy the solution and manually dip the shaver in it while turning the unit on and off intermittently. Great product, so good job Phillips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this because there were reviews that said contrary that got me to try this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard, and my neck can get sensitive from shaving.  I have been using a panasonic and was hoping to get rid of the two slight irritation spots that come and go, as well as some harder to reach hairs.  I used the razor as lightly as possible for two weeks and was extremely uncomfortable with a red/irritated neck until a week after I stopped.  What&#x27;s worse my neck looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to put antibiotic on my neck, which did help once I stopped using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend has a thick beard and recommended this to me, but it&#x27;s simply not a viable option for me.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this because I had one of the older style Norelco shavers that just never seemed to work as well as I expected it should.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The difference is night and day.  Very comfortable and shaves closer with much less time and effort.  Was concerned that the new head might be fragile since it only sits on a center post but seems well built and rugged.  Would have given it 5 stars except price seems excessive for a shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this Norelco. It cleans up nice.</li>
            <li> A few reviews perhaps overhyped how effective the razor would be in the neck area.  It is an improvement from the Braun version I was previously using and I am happy that I switched.  It is a very close shave, but still requires several passes on the neck</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband birthday. He loves it. My son stopped by and hates electric shavers. I had him try it and he will be buying one. Soooo much better than the less expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Series 7 for the past several years and have been overall \\&quot;Ok\\&quot; with it.  Not as good as a blade, but it did give a pretty decent shave.  I shave both my face and head, so a foil razor seemed to be my best option.  Despite replacing shaver head, though, the Braun would still miss some spots, didn&#x27;t give the cleanest of shaves and was outright loud.  So on a lark, I decided to give the Norelco a chance.  Wow, am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to have the old Norelco rotary, and while, like the Braun mentioned above, it was just ok, it didn&#x27;t come close to blade quality.  Also, it did a fairly poor job on my head.  This new Norelco 3D is a world of difference!  Smooth shave right out of the box...for whatever reason, my skin didn&#x27;t need any break-in period.  The razor did an excellent job on my face, neck AND head, and I have to say, it feels to my touch just about as good as any manual blade I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally sold on this razor system and will replace the shaving head every year or so as recommended.  Hey it&#x27;s worth it for the quality, and in the long run still cheaper than a manual razor and blade shaver.  But forget cost:  This Norelco works and is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used...Period!</li>
            <li> I really liked the product, great shave, I was disappointed that it only lasted 2 years. I took it to the certified repair shop in my city. The person there told me unfortunately he sees this more and more. The quality and workmanship is not what used to be. I had to pay $89 for a new handle. I hope someone at Norelco reads this and does something about there quality.</li>
            <li> It is excellent so far. Very pleased. Works as advertised. Jet cleaner works great. The whole package is first rate.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! thats a birthday gift for my bf! and he totally like it! only one bad thing is that the clean solution is expensive to get some new ones.!</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of reviews and considered several razors.  I am happy I selected this razor. The 3D movement to fit the various angles of the face is great. I especially like the fact that I can use this razor in the shower, whihc gives the very best shave, although a dry shave is pretty good as well. If I had to buy a new razor today, it would be this same razor,.  I also like the cleaning/charging system. It&#x27;s nice to know that the razor is cleaned and reaady to go all the time.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old male, so every so often I still get a zit or two, I notice when I use this shaver that sometimes it causes the zits to cluster, but when I use a real, bladed razor this does not happen. Overall, great product, built well, sturdy, quiet, good motor to spin the blades. I would definately recommend this product, with the exception of teens with bad breakouts, or people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was using another electric razor that was working OK, but then the company &amp;#34; Re- designed&amp;#34; the shaving head on it and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good and was always pinching me as I shaved. After a year of trying to put up with this, I&#x27;d had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lots of research I decided to give the 1250 a try. It was a lot more than what I wanted to spend on a razor, but after a year of getting my face tore up, I thought it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get something good. They say to give a new razor 45 days to really start working well, for your face to &amp;#34; get used&amp;#34; to the razor. With the senso touch I immediately felt a difference. I LOVE THIS THING !! It is by far the best razor I have ever used. Shaves as close as a blade, even those tiny little hairs growing sideways on my neck that all other razors have missed.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean, very quiet ( My other one sounded like a lawn mower ) you can barely tell that this one is running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the cleaning system. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it does a good job, but the way the razor is designed, it is so easy to clean on its own you don&#x27;t really need the cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying this, I would strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I have used high end Brauns and Panasonics...and previous Norelcos.  For me, at least, this is a winner.  My neck hairs, never shaved by any other electric, disappear in a flash.  I have no stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner system is far superior to either Panasonic or Braun, using a non alcohol solution and a device that lifts the shaver out of the liquid to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would note, that after having tried probably eight shavers over the years, I find that they really are a personal fit to the individual face.  This new architecture finally fit me.</li>
            <li> this is the electric shaver I have wanted for decades - it shaves (with shaving cream - wet shave) as close as a blade yet is easy and gentle on skin - you can still use it dry for quick touch ups on the run but the wet shave is by far worth the extra time it takes</li>
            <li> The razor has one of the best shaves I have had in years.  However, when I had a mechanical problem with the razor less than 3 months or so after purchase and called Philips Norelco to have it resolved, the run around and abysmal customer apathy for their product was so bad I actually considered just throwing it away.  The great news is that Amazon stepped right up to the plate and took care of the product IMMEDIATELY.  I have never been impressed with someone as much as I was with Amazon that day.  Therefore, I would not recommend this product or any product by Philips Norelco until they get their customer support act together, but with that being said, I make almost every purchase online that I possibly can now thru Amazon.  Amazon was OUTSTANDING!!!!! Its a shame such a fine product is soured by such horrible Manufacture Customer Support.</li>
            <li> excellent electric shaver husband wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> We purchased this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He say&#x27;s it&#x27;s convenient and easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to the shave he had hoped for.  He still uses it frequently though, but I think we will try the Dollar Shave Club for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I was not sure whether I wanted to spend so much money on a razor or not but it turns out that this is one of the best ones I have ever had. I would not trade this one for any other one.</li>
            <li> The complete set is amazing. The razor is excelent and the washing system is very good. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a good razor, the jet cleaning system takes up a lot of space, but it works well.  The one complaint i have is that when i shave i notice the little shaving coming out and ends up littering my counter area...pretty discouraging and messy to say the least.  I also thought it would shave better than my 5 year old norelco that i replaced...it does...but really only marginally better.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to use both the SensoTouch and the Braun Serious 7.  I know there are some more legthy reviews out there so I will try to keep mine short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun worked better for me, and gave me a closer shave.  I am normally a stright razor shaver so it took me some time to get used to both shavers but I found the SensoTouch left me going back and re doing spots I had missed.  It did not cut as well (close) as the Series 7.  (**I did not use the wet shave function of the SensoTouch).  the other deciding factor for me was the self cleaning stationg that came with the Series 7.  It allowed me to basically put my razor away and not have to worry about cleaning or charging the razor.</li>
            <li> this is a great move forward from older models. it comes with the cleaning station and travel pouch and I see this one lasting even longer than the one it is replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like any razor that does not allow replacing worn out batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;register right away and get an added 6 months of warranty to 2 1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I decided to try an electric razor for the first time this year and this razor gives a great shave plus you can use it while you are in the shower. Norelco had a great deal this holiday season on it. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was always a challenge to find a razor that would shave close enough to last thru the day without tearing a few layers of skin off.&lt;br /&gt;This one shaves close and the cleaning system while not a necessity of life is certainly nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it with shaving gel, soap, plain water...even dry...nice shave always.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I had been using a coolskin razor which also gives a great long lasting shave..but if I did not use it with some type of gel it was rough on the face; this razor seems to have solved the problem and so its works no matter what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, if you have not been using a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; razor like this before it will take your face week or two to get used to it. They mention it in the manual, (who reads those), it this case it actually is needed.</li>
            <li> The razor is all that is advertised.  The wet shave feature works great.  Still, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor and takes about the same time as a razor shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my father. When he receive it, he is very happy.He like it very much. Great razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a foil razor I had as it&#x27;s charging/cleaning stand broke, plus it didn&#x27;t shave the best.  I decided to try this one based on the reviews and it&#x27;s been the best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver.  I really like the fact that you can use this wet or dry.  In fact, I normally use shaving gel when shaving with this so that could be the key for me getting a closer shave.  It also does a great job on my neck, which my old razor didn&#x27;t do so well with.  I also like the fact that once I am done shaving I can easily rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I like the razor very much.  I got a good deal on it via Amazon.  It&lt;br /&gt;is very light weight.  The Jet Clean system works much easier that a previous&lt;br /&gt;razor I had of a different brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as an early Valentine&#x27;s Day gift and he loves this razor! The cleaning station is wonderful and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased the predecessor model 3D shaver end of July, 2011 -- less than two years ago.  It&#x27;s battery (Li-ion) just died -- and it&#x27;s NOT replaceable.  That&#x27;s an amortized cost of over $80/year!  And you think straight-blade razor manufacturers make their money on sales of blades?&lt;br /&gt;Hoping for a longer-lasting model this time!&lt;br /&gt;Also two notes for the manufacturer:&lt;br /&gt;1) When traveling, it would be nice NOT to have to carry the small recharging stand.  Earlier (2D) models accepted a cord plug-in at the base -- not so on this model.&lt;br /&gt;2) Earlier cases could be opened; many of us are not so inept that we could not replace the Li-ion battery!  (Prying open the current case would destroy it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still -- I love the shave and hope to enjoy the auto-cleaner with this model.&lt;br /&gt;Last note: needed to call Norelco to personally register this unit as the web site recognized neither the model number nor the barcode (in spite of the fact BOTH were on the Norelco box).[[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250X/42 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System]]</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing a more technological improved model than I received.  Battery life is too short and it is cumbersome to transport.  The charging unit does not fit into the razor case, which means that you need to have another way of carrying the charging unit.  The descriptions of the different models were insufficient to make an intelligent purchasing decision.  I would have preferred a readout of minutes left, rather than lights.  The cleaning using solution is cumbersome.  And it did not come with a brush for dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Soectra series shaver with this unit and have used it now for two weeks. The shave is very good, no complaints there but I highly doubt that it will last as long as my previous ones. The unit just isn&#x27;t built as stout as the other models. The trimmer is sad at best and why it only gets 4 stars.</li>
