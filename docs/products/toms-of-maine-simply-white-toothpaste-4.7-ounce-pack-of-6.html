            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste!</li>
            <li>Kind of taste like those butter mint things, but unlike those butter mints,it prevents cavities.</li>
            <li>(i.e. not putting each tube in its own box).</li>
            <li>Makes teeth feel very clean!</li>
            <li>Gone through 2 tubes so far, and they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know, or haven&#x27;t tried Tom&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a much more natural toothpaste, while still doing a great job of cleaning your teeth!</li>
            <li>It does help sensitivity problems better than Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  </li>
            <li>I used to love both crest and Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s has many toothpastes</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Simply White Toothpaste is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Really whitens and tastes great.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s, simply, make the best toothpaste in the world.</li>
            <li>I love how my mouth feels after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and they would not have any more</li>
            <li>We love all of Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I mostly like the consistentcy</li>
            <li>it is thicker than most.</li>
            <li>I LOVE TOM&#x27;S nearly as much as I love Maine.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is great, clean and fresh, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>Fine product, works well.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
            <li>using Tom&#x27;s my mouth still feels great the next morning after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a light mint flavor that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;tree hugger&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s nice to see a company that is responsible.</li>
            <li>I also really like that they pay their employees to donate 12 days per year to charitable organizations.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope that Tom&#x27;s of Maine will continue to bring us great natural products while keeping their commitment to the environment.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste because of the minty taste and how clean it makes my mouth</li>
            <li>It costs more, but I like the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll contiinue to order the Clean Mint from here on out.</li>
            <li>The product quality is as expected from Tom&#x27;s which in my opinion is great.  </li>
            <li>It tasted like a mouth full of sugary spearmint</li>
            <li>True Mint]], and</li>
            <li>We have been using this and other tastes of Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes for many years and we, our children and grand children love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>And so fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li>good toothpaste with fluoride (if that&#x27;s an issue); good price compared to supermarket and natural food stores; much less sugar-y than all those toothpastes with saccharin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great toothpaste, has a &#x27;decent&#x27; (for lack of better words)</li>
            <li>But after getting pregnant, I cannot stand the taste of crest anymore.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients, and the nice fresh taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a mild mint flavour and cleans my teeth a treat, no nasties in it</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste and it has the added bonus of being made in the good old USA.  </li>
            <li>Good 2-year shelf-life, so a 6-pack will be used up long before it expires.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but this is a great product -  </li>
            <li>Wanted a toothpaste that was more natural and found this one.  </li>
            <li>I also love the natural &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s more natural.</li>
            <li>I love that it is made of natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that it really whitens my teeth and the flavor is pretty strong, but still givinig it 4 stars</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I liked this very much until I ran out and bought Crest again last night.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>As it has been difficult to find this product in retail stores, this online access is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive teeth, too - used to use a big brand sensitive brand and now cannot even use that.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been aware of the brand for years but never gave them a try.</li>
            <li>It has a slight abrasive quality so you really feel you&#x27;re doing some good.</li>
            <li>It works well and has no overwhelming after taste just a pleasant understated mint.</li>
            <li>It is not icky sweet like other toothpastes, and seems to not have as much abrasive material either - a good characteristic.</li>
            <li>My order came very promptly.  </li>
            <li>It is really a life saver.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>(Tom&#x27;s products are now available in all my local grocery stores, drug stores, and supermarkets).</li>
            <li>all the time so although it is nice to have them shipped to home if you are at Target or any other store and have a coupon you are better off, if only slightly.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was &#x27;All Natural&#x27; and did not notice this had Fluoride!</li>
            <li>But on the other hand I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the quality and values of the original company are now going to suffer.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but most have a fake sweet taste.  </li>
            <li>whitening affect, doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or too strong of a taste either,</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize it while you&#x27;re using it your whole life but after going clean/natural and then going back, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s makes natural products.  </li>
            <li>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea and floss twice a day, so that really aids in my white teeth/overall</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>the challenge - brush with Tom&#x27;s for 1 week and then try your old toothpaste...</li>
            <li>Wow, not only it is less abrasive than crest, it also actually whitens better.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a long time now and really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this from my local health food store, but they said it was no longer produced it</li>
            <li>I have been using Toms&#x27; for years, and would use no other.  </li>
            <li>however, they recently added SLS or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate to their ingredient list and that is something I generally want to avoid when I can, so when this tube is done, I&#x27;ll be trying something new.</li>
            <li>funny to me and don&#x27;t seem to clean as well, leaving a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Which is why I was very surprised to read that \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; is now partially owned by Colgate-Palmolive.</li>

            <li> do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous but expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the few \\&quot;natural&#x27; toothpastes that has an ADA seal...</li>
            <li> We have used it for a long time and just started purchasing it through subscribe and save since it can be harder to find in local stores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best toothpaste at the best price!</li>
            <li> good toothpaste with fluoride (if that&#x27;s an issue); good price compared to supermarket and natural food stores; much less sugar-y than all those toothpastes with saccharin.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because of the minty taste and how clean it makes my mouth feel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Denblan and it&#x27;s fabulous but expensive.  It does help sensitivity problems better than Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But I recommend this toothpaste because it&#x27;s good and it&#x27;s a great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from frequesnt cancre sores, especially after eating acidic foods, this is the toothpaste for you.  My order came very promptly.  As it has been difficult to find this product in retail stores, this online access is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I liked this very much until I ran out and bought Crest again last night. After 6 tubes of Tom&#x27;s and enough time weaning off Crest, I realized how gross Crest is. It tasted like a mouth full of sugary spearmint and I was grossed out. You don&#x27;t realize it while you&#x27;re using it your whole life but after going clean/natural and then going back, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Had to order because this product is not sold locally. Great product</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.  Noticed that the major brand toothpastes all have artificial sweeteners and dyes in their list of ingredients.  Wanted a toothpaste that was more natural and found this one.  It tastes great and cleans well.  I will continue to use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.  It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006.  Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products.  The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf.  It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot;  The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze.  One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years.  The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  On Amazon, you can find [[ASIN:B001EJOQAG Peppermint]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPJS Spearmint]], [[ASIN:B0000532QH Fennel]], [[ASIN:B001EJOQGK Orange-Mango]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPUC Cinnamint]], [[ASIN:B000MANVT0 Wintermint]],  [[ASIN:B001EJOR14 Apricot]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUBS Soothing Mint]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUD6 True Mint]], and [[ASIN:B0000532QK Gingermint]], among others.  I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.  Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea and floss twice a day, so that really aids in my white teeth/overall oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste, has a &#x27;decent&#x27; (for lack of better words) whitening affect, doesn&#x27;t have a harsh or too strong of a taste either, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few \\&quot;natural&#x27; toothpastes that has an ADA seal...however, they recently added SLS or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate to their ingredient list and that is something I generally want to avoid when I can, so when this tube is done, I&#x27;ll be trying something new.</li>
            <li> I used to love both crest and Tom&#x27;s. But after getting pregnant, I cannot stand the taste of crest anymore. The mint flavor is great, clean and fresh, but not too strong. It is really a life saver.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  We have used it for a long time and just started purchasing it through subscribe and save since it can be harder to find in local stores. Makes teeth feel very clean!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.  Since I started using Tom&#x27;s a few years ago, my teeth are less sensitive.  I also love the natural &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am a fan of minty freshness.  If you are, you should get this toothpaste.  It makes you look forward to brushing.  Kind of taste like those butter mint things, but unlike those butter mints,it prevents cavities.</li>
            <li> It is not natural! It consists of SLS, sodium laureth sulfate, an extremly dangerous chemical. By the way, Tom&#x27;s is owned by Colgate, who does not care about the health of your family.</li>
            <li> Good but please remove SLS from the toothpaste ASAP !!!</li>
            <li> For us, this is a great toothpaste. It costs more, but I like the more natural ingredients. It has a slight abrasive quality so you really feel you&#x27;re doing some good.</li>
            <li> Great price for six tubes of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste. I have no complaints about the product but I wish there was a way to minimize the packaging (i.e. not putting each tube in its own box).</li>
            <li> I immediately felt a difference from other regular toothpastes. Toms makes my teeth feel cleaner and I don&#x27;t wake up with any toothpaste residue. Plus it&#x27;s more natural. I will never go back to crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li> My family and I decided to start using a healthier toothpaste and Tom&#x27;s of Maine does not disappoint! Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Will be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Tom&#x27;s Toothpaste before I got a sample pack of Simply White paste in the mail a few weeks ago. I tried it out of curiosity, and my teeth felt cleaner than they have since my last dentist appointment. My husband and children tried it, too, and they were equally hooked.  I ran out of the sample tube and had to go back to Crest for a day.  The taste of Crest (which I&#x27;ve used consistently my entire life) was overwhelmingly strong and just tasted weird. My teeth didn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean. I&#x27;m sticking with Tom&#x27;s from now on.</li>
            <li> I thought it was &#x27;All Natural&#x27; and did not notice this had Fluoride! At least there are NO Sweeteners!&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s has many toothpastes - just select wisely to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of toothpaste for years and recommend it.  I like the natural ingredients, and the nice fresh taste.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm... Tasty! ...And so fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a long time now and really have no complaints. I know some people were concerned when Tom&#x27;s sold the company but it&#x27;s still the same great product. No complaints and no cavities from us!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have every used,</li>
            <li> Great mint taste after brushing your teeth. It does not have a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or chemical taste. . . . .</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Simply White Toothpaste is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  I love that it is made of natural ingredients too. Really whitens and tastes great.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s, simply, make the best toothpaste in the world. I won&#x27;t use anything else even though I have to ship it half way around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the challenge - brush with Tom&#x27;s for 1 week and then try your old toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Much less than the health stores! We love it!</li>
            <li> My go-to brand, and go-to flavor.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that it really whitens my teeth and the flavor is pretty strong, but still givinig it 4 stars</li>
            <li> The best in healthy toothpaste</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste!</li>
            <li> The product quality is as expected from Tom&#x27;s which in my opinion is great.  The problem is with pricing.  Tom&#x27;s now has $1 off coupons all the time so although it is nice to have them shipped to home if you are at Target or any other store and have a coupon you are better off, if only slightly.</li>
            <li> I love how my mouth feels after using this toothpaste. I hate when your moth feels like cotton in the morning but using Tom&#x27;s my mouth still feels great the next morning after. And yes I do still brush the next morning too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this toothpaste in stores. So, I tried Amazon! Gone through 2 tubes so far, and they&#x27;re perfect! I paid much less than I would at a local retailer, and it&#x27;s the same product! Good 2-year shelf-life, so a 6-pack will be used up long before it expires. For those who don&#x27;t know, or haven&#x27;t tried Tom&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a much more natural toothpaste, while still doing a great job of cleaning your teeth! No extra chemicals or additives. I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s toothpaste for years and swear by it! Now, the regular brands taste...funny to me and don&#x27;t seem to clean as well, leaving a weird aftertaste. NOT TOM&#x27;S! Give it a try, and if you like it, get this 6-pack!</li>
            <li> Fine product, works well.</li>
            <li> Wow, not only it is less abrasive than crest, it also actually whitens better.  Never though that would happen.  Tastes good too.  Kids say it burns though.</li>
            <li> Works great, and a great value!</li>
            <li> I normally buy this from my local health food store, but they said it was no longer produced it and they would not have any more stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure that I had a good supply I ordered a six pack that was delivered promptly and without any delivery problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild mint flavour and cleans my teeth a treat, no nasties in it and my dentist is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but this is a great product -  I switched when on HCG program years ago. It takes about a week to get used to it compared to regular toothpaste brands, but once you do, you&#x27;ll never go back. Great for sensitive teeth, too - used to use a big brand sensitive brand and now cannot even use that. Tom&#x27;s works best for me - and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Tom&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been aware of the brand for years but never gave them a try. I happened to run across a sale on this toothpaste and decided to give it a try. The taste is very nice. It&#x27;s just a light mint flavor that is not overpowering. I also like the story behind Tom&#x27;s.  While I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;tree hugger&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s nice to see a company that is responsible. I also really like that they pay their employees to donate 12 days per year to charitable organizations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve like Tom&#x27;s for a while but this flavor is the best of the one I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll contiinue to order the Clean Mint from here on out.</li>
            <li> We love all of Tom&#x27;s products. They are Made in USA! Thank you</li>
            <li> We have been using this and other tastes of Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes for many years and we, our children and grand children love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Toms&#x27; for years, and would use no other.  It is not icky sweet like other toothpastes, and seems to not have as much abrasive material either - a good characteristic.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best.  I have tried others but most have a fake sweet taste.  My teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste and company are so much better than Crest or Colgate, which are absolutely horrible loaded with chemicals and toxins and couldn&#x27;t care less about the environment. Which is why I was very surprised to read that \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; is now partially owned by Colgate-Palmolive. This is a bit disappointing and troubling. On the one hand, I understand the need to be able to bring the products to a wider consumer base (Tom&#x27;s products are now available in all my local grocery stores, drug stores, and supermarkets). But on the other hand I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the quality and values of the original company are now going to suffer. I certainly hope that Tom&#x27;s of Maine will continue to bring us great natural products while keeping their commitment to the environment.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA so no need to worry about additives or quality.  It works well and has no overwhelming after taste just a pleasant understated mint.</li>
            <li> I like this product but can&#x27;t always find in local stores.  I mostly like the consistentcy it is thicker than most.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for awhile now, and prefer it over other products like Rembrandt.  Amazon&#x27;s price beats the price I have to pay at my local retail store.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste and it has the added bonus of being made in the good old USA.  Tastes good too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TOM&#x27;S nearly as much as I love Maine. Great discount here for buying in bulk.</li>
