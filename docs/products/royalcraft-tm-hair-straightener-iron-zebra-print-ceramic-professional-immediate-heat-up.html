            <li>Would recommend. :)</li>
            <li>I love zebra strips</li>
            <li>but we all know it is important to buy a straightener that is amazing for our hair.</li>
            <li>I had wayy better straightners.</li>
            <li>:) I love it.</li>
            <li>Does its job and worked for me for more than 1 year.</li>
            <li>it wound up being free!)</li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>Ok, it&#x27;s an $18.00 hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s  still way better than the one I&#x27;ve been using for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Love the design and the price</li>
            <li>It handles well, heats up quickly, and in addition looks very stylish.</li>
            <li>Different heat settings are available so that&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>Its an okay straightener if you don&#x27;t have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable while holding it and</li>
            <li>Such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>but there is a sliver of light when you close the two paddles.</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely and it probably would be decent if it didn&#x27;t pull, and to me thats a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like what the professionals use but in your own home, I mean come on how great is that.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast no waiting stylish zebra print hair doesnt feel treated after use gets all the kinks out of hair.</li>
            <li>and I used for a quick fix on the tips of my hair or to fix the pony tail mark.</li>
            <li>Heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t truly need that information, because the functions are pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hot on one side, so watch your fingers!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only stylish!</li>
            <li>Safety first!</li>
            <li>This straightener leaves my hair straight, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought professional grade straighteners but this is even better and works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot and seems to straighten quickly</li>
            <li>It delivered very fast and it is such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up right away....</li>
            <li>They sit right below the ceramic bar.</li>
            <li>Overall am pleased and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is made very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from them again :)</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>It defiantly isn&#x27;t that hot either</li>
            <li>Love that there are different settings!</li>
            <li>I just wish it had an automatic shut off if accidentally left on for more than 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Took me forever to find a straightener that could handle my thick and curly hair, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>Very effective little tool, which heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair much.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and for someone with really heavy and straight hair it does an amazing Job on giving a curly touch on the tips.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The short period of time it seemed to work fine, but one day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on or heat up.</li>
            <li>I also just tried it and it heats up so fast and straightned  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly</li>
            <li>It does heat up fairly fast.</li>
            <li>heats up in 1 fast minute.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Curls very well along with straightening.</li>
            <li>hair is much smoother considering the amount of frizz</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair straight all day.</li>
            <li>It might be great for people with thin hair</li>
            <li>I give this product five stars because this element heats fast, and does the job it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping time.</li>
            <li>works fast and works as promised</li>
            <li>This product gives high performance for its price~!</li>
            <li>I have to go over one section over and over to get it even slightly straight.</li>
            <li>If your hair is naturally really wavy dont get it.</li>
            <li>This straightener is garbage it really is a knock off</li>
            <li>love this it gets really super hot and my hair is really hard to straighten  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money for a back up straightener but should have invested in something a little better.</li>
            <li>has a few different heat settings, which i really love!</li>
            <li>and it still heats up like new.</li>
            <li>Then plates stay even and the straightened still looks new.</li>
            <li>The two plates don&#x27;t come together completely which can be a little frustrating when styling but other than that it&#x27;s a great straightener, heats up quickly and efficiently and leaves my hair looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li>If you can live with the zebra print, I guarantee you will not find a better hair straightener for this unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>but it was a huge waste of money after express shipping.</li>
            <li>That typo should be fixed.</li>
            <li>So classy</li>
            <li>I ordered this straightener for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Hard to read and easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>I am really disappointed since it got pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, it was here in less than a week.</li>

            <li> I ordered this straightener for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Hard to read and easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed since it got pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, it was here in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Yes it gets very hot, but that does no good if you can&#x27;t put enough pressure on the hair.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is it doesn&#x27;t heat up as quickly as I&#x27;d like, but for the price I paid for it (it was on clearance, the total was $18.xx</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to heat up but other than that it works really well.</li>
            <li> so if you have long hair plan on taking all day to get the job done, IF you can hold it closed tightly enough.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily on extremely long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful so you don&#x27;t pull out your hair!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product over any other one!</li>
            <li> Other than that I recommend this!</li>
            <li> It works extremely well!!</li>
            <li> This straightened is stupid cheap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I had this straightener for just a few weeks</li>
            <li> The only thing i was really disappointed with was that it said it could heat up to 400 degrees when it only heats up to 200.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> I like the straightener, the few flaws!</li>
            <li> It is flimsy and difficult to hold closed tightly.</li>
            <li> It is very narrow</li>
            <li> not exactly fun to pull hair out at the same time. :(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that where the controls are is awkward placement.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed, and I was not refunded my money back since it took close to 10 days to receive after ordering and then used it for approximately three weeks, the 30 day refund policy had expired.</li>
            <li> For some one with thick hair this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> This straightener is not good at all.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to glide through your hair and mine is thin !</li>
            <li> not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> The other it makes a humming noise, which is slightly annoying in your ear.</li>
            <li> This one unfortunately is one of the ones that gets one or two strands of your hair stuck in it as you are straightening so</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> but it always frustrated me.</li>
            <li> It snags your hair and works like crap.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> honestly this is like the best thing I have received on Amazon , it came so fast l! I also just tried it and it heats up so fast and straightned  so well and does everything it said it would ! love it ! so glad I decided to get it ! suggest it !</li>
            <li> If you have a prime account its a great deal. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 240v and instead got a 110v</li>
            <li> Its an okay straightener if you don&#x27;t have super curly hair. My hair is really curly so when I use this straightener I have to go over every strand like 100 times and even then it doesn&#x27;t last all day. I eventually gave mine to my mother since she has really short hair but it always frustrated me.</li>
            <li> Leaves a smell on your hair when you straighten it but hairspray will do</li>
            <li> It was a decent deal but overall the plates did not meet and were slightly off. It does pull your hair. It does heat up fairly fast.</li>
            <li> Great straightener at a great price!! Leaves my hair smooth &amp; silky. It&#x27;s like what the professionals use but in your own home, I mean come on how great is that. Fast shipping, it was here in less than a week. I have had no problems with it. Thank you, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from them again :)</li>
            <li> this is the best straightner I have ever had. heats up in 1 fast minute. I can curl my hair one day and the next day straighten my hair and I only have to do each piece one time.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well!! and appreciate of using it when i do it works like it says. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have another straightener, but it burns my hands and my hair!  This straightener leaves my hair straight, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it. The zebra print design just adds pizzaz. The only thing i was really disappointed with was that it said it could heat up to 400 degrees when it only heats up to 200. That typo should be fixed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!! It snags your hair and works like crap. I&#x27;d compare it to a $20 one at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for 6 months and suddenly it&#x27;s stopped heating up entirely.</li>
            <li> I really like this. Received in two days with Prime. Came nicely packed with instructions. Curls very well along with straightening. Feels comfortable while holding it and hair is much smoother considering the amount of frizz I have. Overall am pleased and worth the price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It does a good job. I have straight hair and I used for a quick fix on the tips of my hair or to fix the pony tail mark. It heats up quickly and for someone with really heavy and straight hair it does an amazing Job on giving a curly touch on the tips.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars it keeps my hair straight all day. This would be the best one I ever had!!!!!!! Me and my friends use it all the time when they spend the night. We will apply makeup then hair and its PERFECT HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the price. Straightened my hair with no frizz, and even made it shiny! has a few different heat settings, which i really love! Would recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Heats up fast no waiting stylish zebra print hair doesnt feel treated after use gets all the kinks out of hair.</li>
            <li> love this it gets really super hot and my hair is really hard to straighten  but this works like a dream</li>
            <li> It might be great for people with thin hair but if you have a lion&#x27;s mane like I do, then don&#x27;t buy it. It looses heat after every section and you have to wait for it to hear back up.</li>
            <li> I love zebra strips but we all know it is important to buy a straightener that is amazing for our hair. This one unfortunately is one of the ones that gets one or two strands of your hair stuck in it as you are straightening so not exactly fun to pull hair out at the same time. :(</li>
            <li> I had wayy better straightners. But this gets the job done. You get what you pay for.. Also people say it rips out your hair it has not ripped out my hair at all. Lol</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because this element heats fast, and does the job it supposed to do. I really love this straightener! I recommend this product over any other one!</li>
            <li> nice price :) I love it. it is so fetch!!!!! yes. amazing grace the sweetest. Nice design as well. So classy</li>
            <li> Does its job and worked for me for more than 1 year. It is durable and will last with proper care and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener for my 11 year old daughter. It is great!! She loves it! And it works great!</li>
            <li> Works good once heated up, but doesn&#x27;t heat up as quickly as advertised. Love the zebra print! Fast shipping time.</li>
            <li> The two plates don&#x27;t come together completely which can be a little frustrating when styling but other than that it&#x27;s a great straightener, heats up quickly and efficiently and leaves my hair looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This straightener is just like the ones used in salons!  The price cannot be beat!  The zebra print is also very stylish!</li>
            <li> Needs an automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> I love my Straightener!</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product. I only have two complaints; the plastic finish around the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; button melts off with use. One doesn&#x27;t truly need that information, because the functions are pretty straightforward. The other complaint is it doesn&#x27;t heat up as quickly as I&#x27;d like, but for the price I paid for it (it was on clearance, the total was $18.xx and I used my ex-boyfriend&#x27;s remaining balance on the gift card his mother got him for Christmas, so it wound up being free!), it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up right away.... you have to hold the on button for awhile for it to work.... not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> works fast and works as promised</li>
            <li> If you can live with the zebra print, I guarantee you will not find a better hair straightener for this unbelievable price. It delivered very fast and it is such an amazing product.  I definitely would recommend this to everybody whether it is for a gift or personal use</li>
            <li> Burnt my hands constantly, didn&#x27;t do anything but pull and snag my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> It is what I was looking for. I does everything I want with my hair. I am very happy now.</li>
            <li> good job with nice value</li>
            <li> This product gives high performance for its price~!</li>
            <li> This straightened is stupid cheap I&#x27;ve has it two years now and it still heats up like new. Then plates stay even and the straightened still looks new. I use it almost daily on extremely long thick wavy hair. I&#x27;ve bought professional grade straighteners but this is even better and works. better</li>
            <li> I like the straightener, the few flaws! It&#x27;s really hot on one side, so watch your fingers! The other it makes a humming noise, which is slightly annoying in your ear. Other than that I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s an $18.00 hair straightener.  It works well but there is a sliver of light when you close the two paddles. For some one with thick hair this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. It&#x27;s hot and seems to straighten quickly but the edges grab my hair and pull strands out. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money for a back up straightener but should have invested in something a little better. The hair is left silky and shiny but ouch, it does pull.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this item. It handles well, heats up quickly, and in addition looks very stylish. It does snag the hair at times. But it&#x27;s  still way better than the one I&#x27;ve been using for over 2 years now. I recommend this product. Just be careful so you don&#x27;t pull out your hair! lol</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this straightener. She will use it for years to come. It arrived quickly and is made very well.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to glide through your hair and mine is thin ! I have to go over one section over and over to get it even slightly straight. After all the reviews I thought it would be great but it was a huge waste of money after express shipping. It defiantly isn&#x27;t that hot either</li>
            <li> This straightener is not good at all. It pulls my hair as I straighten. I am really disappointed since it got pretty good reviews. Maybe I just got a bad one. It heats up nicely and it probably would be decent if it didn&#x27;t pull, and to me thats a deal breaker. I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only stylish! But works great on my course hair! Different heat settings are available so that&#x27;s awesome! The only thing is, it takes a while to heat up! It doesn&#x27;t bother me, because I just wait and do my makeup, but it may matter to others!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. It doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. It is flimsy and difficult to hold closed tightly. Yes it gets very hot, but that does no good if you can&#x27;t put enough pressure on the hair. It is very narrow so if you have long hair plan on taking all day to get the job done, IF you can hold it closed tightly enough. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to heat up but other than that it works really well. I like that I can adjust the temperature on it, and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that where the controls are is awkward placement. They sit right below the ceramic bar. Hard to read and easy to burn yourself.  It is well lit though when in use. I do like it.</li>
            <li> This item does not heat up to what it says my hair looks like I never straighten it I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> Very effective little tool, which heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair much. Love that there are different settings!</li>
            <li> Aweful. Broke four days after I bought it. Dont waste your money.  Didnt work that great when it was working.</li>
            <li> Heats up really quickly. I just wish it had an automatic shut off if accidentally left on for more than 30 minutes or so. Safety first!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great. Took me forever to find a straightener that could handle my thick and curly hair, but this one is great.</li>
            <li> its great for the price! i recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the design and the price but I noticed as I straighten my hair it pulls my hair out.</li>
            <li> I had this straightener for just a few weeks and it stopped working. The short period of time it seemed to work fine, but one day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on or heat up. I was not impressed, and I was not refunded my money back since it took close to 10 days to receive after ordering and then used it for approximately three weeks, the 30 day refund policy had expired.</li>
            <li> Awful! If your hair is naturally really wavy dont get it. This straightener is garbage it really is a knock off</li>
