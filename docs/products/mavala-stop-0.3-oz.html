            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>It was a good price with great reviews.</li>
            <li>This product worked remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>it love it love it !!!!</li>
            <li>My daughter liked it!</li>
            <li>The product does not wash off easily which makes it very effective!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, that instinct I assumed she had that drew her thumb into her mouth ceased with a quickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing because I thought she would never stop.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled since the dentist was telling me it was now or never.  </li>
            <li>But that means that it is really, really effective.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m kind of upset she did not stop</li>
            <li>She never got used to the flavor, and we are very happy that we didn&#x27;t even come close to using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>She told us that she used Mavala on her own daughter when her daughter wanted to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>oh boy, is this stuff effective.</li>
            <li>It is so effective that it makes her gag when she gets it in her mouth.</li>
            <li>It would be excellent to stop nail biting in older children or adults.</li>
            <li>i bought this for a person with a very strong thumb addiction</li>
            <li>you will be touching any type of food while cooking or eating, make sure to wear gloves!</li>
            <li>this Mavala is by far superior!!!  </li>
            <li>If that is fixed this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Worked great for the first day.</li>
            <li>think that&#x27;s a good thing though, makes you VERY aware of where your hands go throughout the day</li>
            <li>After three nights, she doesn&#x27;t suck any more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li>, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li>She still wears the Thumbuster at night - I think more for the novelty than the need but who cares??  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>He told me, \\&quot;Okay,</li>
            <li>You get a lot of product (more than you will need)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and my fingers have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product and worth the try for thumb sucking or nail biting.</li>
            <li>I am confident that we have found a solution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - for the record my wife makes a killer meatloaf!  :-)</li>
            <li>I was able to stop using the product all together and still maintain my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but wonder if a change was made to cut costs or to intentionally force people to use up the product sooner so they would buy more.  </li>
            <li>This rating is by my daughter who sucked her thumb for 8 years - i have tried many products none of them worked</li>
            <li>and that was more than</li>
            <li>but it has been rather humorous to see my son&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note...</li>
            <li>Have been trying many ways to let him quit ...</li>
            <li>After doing some research I found this product which is safe for kids.</li>
            <li>Simply I have to say that this product is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love it  love  </li>
            <li>Im sure it will get him to stop biting his nails and fingers in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I do not see where this stuff is safe and will not use it</li>
            <li>And my nails already look better after a week.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought this to break the habit mostly at night, but we put it on twice a day...</li>
            <li>Her hands look better and her nails are beginning to grow.  </li>
            <li>I will admit when the dentist told me about this product I wasn&#x27;t so sure that it worked.  </li>
            <li>This is an OK product, it does its job but not well.</li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails for many years.</li>
            <li>I bought this product,and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Glad we tried it.</li>
            <li>They would mostly suck their thumbs at night when they had their blankets.  </li>
            <li>I applied it one more time just to make sure</li>
            <li>Glad I didnt have to buy those 80$ thumb covers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I put it on him, I made sure he was still okay with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried wrapping athletic tape on his thumb and it worked ok</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth any more.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s given up trying to use this on her nails, but we&#x27;ve found an even better use for this product: RABBIT CHEWING DETERRENT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and have paid a lot more money for something I was told would help my child stop sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li>great product highly recommend</li>
            <li>many have already stated, go easy on this stuff and keep an eye on your kid while eating/drinking.  </li>
            <li>If you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, or nail biting, order this RIGHT NOW!!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, attractive like a clear nail polish, but not too shiny so that I think boys could use this without anyone noticing.</li>
            <li>We love this product and are excited to use it with my daughter who bites her nails.</li>
            <li>Drinks don&#x27;t make it go away, it lasts for 15+ minutes easily if ANY gets in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything else we tried just washed off easily.  </li>
            <li>90 and going strong though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest the nail polish if your child doesn&#x27;t have a really strong habit</li>
            <li>but i guess his addiction was just too strong.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the very best product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering such a great product.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>All you need is a light coating of the product on your nails to keep your nails away from your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The Mavala was fantastic.</li>
            <li>When he was about 3, we finally managed to get it away from him (although he protested greatly).</li>
            <li>One day a light popped on in my head</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCE REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>Go ahead and place your order - this stuff really WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>So I combine manicures and Mavala and my nails are super long and beautiful now.</li>
            <li>I guess I have to use more of it on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on the Mavala Stop and was impressed and anxious to try</li>
            <li>After the first application, I put more on after 3 days.</li>
            <li>Originally I applied it as directed</li>
            <li>SUCCESS!  </li>
            <li>Based on all the other positive reviews for this product, I decided to give it a go (nail biter for the best part of 30 years).</li>
            <li>She is now very proud that she no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent and it really works.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say a child under the age of three may not have full taste buds and</li>
            <li>That being said, while I believe the product can work wonders for many, it did not accomplish the mission as fast as I wanted.</li>
            <li>He laughed about how gross it was but also asked for water to get the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>I think it works better if the child really wants to stop too.</li>
            <li>I was immediately able to stop biting my nails after biting nonstop for my whole life (28 years).</li>
            <li>However, it worked, and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li>seems to wear off quickly</li>
            <li>I talked up how we were going to be getting something to help him quick thumb sucking and nail biting before we got it.  </li>
            <li>and you quickly learn to keep hands off your face</li>
            <li>but she was quickly reminded from the taste of it that she wasn&#x27;t supposed to have her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Stopped his habit quick.</li>
            <li>, it worth it, its yucky, it can be used in kids 3yo and older, i already love it since day 1.</li>
            <li>and my daughter has not sucked her thumb since the first application!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter because the description says it&#x27;s safe for children, but the packaging states</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This tides me over until I have time to get a fresh manicure</li>
            <li>When nothing turned out to be a success, I found this product and bought it immediately.  </li>
            <li>beware, unlike the old &#x27;thumb&#x27; that was more like seasoning, this stuff is powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a year of frustration we bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHVMP8/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 recently and so far it&#x27;s been great...</li>
            <li>We tried everything for almost 2 years without success.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about this product; however, I didn&#x27;t feel it did any better than the other products that I only paid about $3.50 for.</li>
            <li>This item shipped quickly and was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>The first time his fingernail went in his mouth resulted in a look on his face like he just took a bite of mom&#x27;sdreaded meatloaf and he quickly asked for his water.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>Bought this hoping to stop him and he would just suck right through it.</li>
            <li>I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away.</li>
            <li>He put his thumb in his mouth automatically when I tucked him in and immediately took it right out again.</li>
            <li>(right before I reapplied) and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for the first few days.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is also a good way to curb that Cheetos habit ;)</li>
            <li>On the first night we applied it (right before bedtime and during storytime), she ended up going to sleep without sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Our spoiled little Holland Lop rabbit loved to chew on our electrical cords</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Also, as a topcoat it is not very shiny and has a kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;/nonreflective texture that doesn&#x27;t look</li>
            <li>I tried the Thumbuster alone first</li>
            <li>but she \\&quot;lost\\&quot; it after the first day.  </li>
            <li>Mavala Stop is the first product I have tried.</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The month is up exactly 30 days after we first started the Mavala Stop</li>
            <li>I have been an avid nail biter</li>
            <li>Just be willing to accept that it may not work for your situation.</li>
            <li>I do it willingly and unwillingly.</li>
            <li>so just be prepared to apply it consistently</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I had nails and no desire to bite them anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it deterred Thumb-sucking from the first time we applied it.  </li>
            <li>first tried the over the counter nail biting remedy called Thumb.</li>
            <li>The first bottle has lasted over 2 months</li>
            <li>She put her thumb in her mouth after the first application, and immediately began to gag.  </li>
            <li>She must have vommited 4 times that first day.  </li>
            <li>And once it hits your tounge, it spreads over your whole mouth!  </li>
            <li>she has decided the taste is funny</li>
            <li>I also put it on to show solidarity -- and because I was also biting my own -- and let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t want to put the lingering bitter tasting stuff on my fingers ever again.</li>
            <li>This works lightening fast!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another parent said to watch for regurgitation on first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The only thing that was able to stop my son from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Have a camera to record the funny faces and bottle of water.</li>
            <li>During his most recent dentist visit, the dentist told him he needed to stop sucking his thumb because he is pushing his teeth out of alignment.</li>
            <li>My daughter was reluctant to let me put it on her thumb at first</li>
            <li>But it really works!</li>
            <li>and it was pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried Thum (available at Walgreens &amp; many other retailers), which doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to Mavala STOP!  </li>
            <li>This product really is a miracle worker for me right now.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old sucked her thumb almost since birth, and my 9 year old has been biting her fingernails since she was about 3 were able to kick their habits in one day of using Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li>So Far the product was recommended by her dentist to stop my daughter from sucking her fingers and so far it is working, so satisfied.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I applied too much, and had to eat all my food with knife and fork for the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I started biting my nails to the quick at a very young age.  </li>
            <li>The first time I painted his whole nail.</li>
            <li>If your child is ready and aware to fix it but needs some help, it works.</li>
            <li>for sure it works, i don&#x27;t bite as long as i have it on.</li>
            <li>as long as it&#x27;s memorable</li>
            <li>To which my wife replied \\&quot;are you ready to stop sucking your thumb now?\\&quot; and that was pretty much it.</li>
            <li>If not, it doesn&#x27;t work at all to certain children.</li>
            <li>Well I can share this - he certainly doesn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li>This would probably work better than all other brands, but the solution is just super strong and bitter.  </li>
            <li>Yes it really does stay on for days even with washing.</li>
            <li>I think it depends on how ready your child is to stop according to my experience with my son.</li>
            <li>REAL STORY STARTS HERE.</li>
            <li>Very thankful for the recommendation from our dentist.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely convinced that the manufacturer has changed the composition of this product.  </li>
            <li>I never imagined it would work so fast.  </li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for complete success.</li>
            <li>REALLY HELP HIM QUITE.</li>
            <li>so it really helps remind them to keep their fingers out of their mouth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Mavala!</li>
            <li>The best feeling in the world was cutting my nails with nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>But, she did quit sucking her thumb for 2 STRAIGHT days, which was a miricle in itself.  </li>
            <li>Even braces don&#x27;t fix everything,and no one wants to spend so much money on braces.</li>
            <li>My child wasn&#x27;t quite ready to stop but we bought the product anyway.</li>
            <li>Are you ready to stop?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so she&#x27;s not quite ready.  </li>
            <li>I would not put this on very oung children.</li>
            <li>product works very well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in months thanks to this.</li>
            <li>and it really didnt work,</li>
            <li>it really</li>
            <li>and I really regretted.</li>
            <li>He is on day four and it has been going really well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;son already doesnt suck his thumb so much</li>
            <li>my girlfriend bites her nails and wants to stop so</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>However, he did want to taste my pink nail polish to see if it tasted better.</li>
            <li>So it may have really worked afterall.</li>
            <li>It work very well.</li>
            <li>tried so many different ways to stop my son&#x27;s thumb sucking and nail biting since he was 2.5 years old.</li>
            <li>The greatest thing about it was that one coating would last at least 10 days and allowed me to completely kick the nail biting habit.  </li>
            <li>He does try to wash it off, so I have to be really good about remembering to apply it at least once a day.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>In two weeks time she completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li>The other similar products didn&#x27;t have as good reviews and some even stated they discolored the finger nail.  </li>
            <li>the product may not work due to the fact that they may not be able to taste the bitterness.  </li>
            <li>once every other day) just to make sure the habit doesn&#x27;t reappear.  </li>
            <li>The good thing with the taste is now I avoid getting my fingers near my mouth and no more biting.</li>
            <li>It is applied very easily but it spread to the tips of his fingers even after it dried so</li>
            <li>We tried this product in our first attempt to get our 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I think her habit was completely curbed within the first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was young, I&#x27;ve tried pretty everything</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product to make my 4 yrs old stop sucking his thumb, I spend about $80 on the ThumbGard, that it is more complicated than a nail polish, and wow this product and for the price it is the best, it really works, only one application last about 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;(I would say, offer your child some water the first couple times they get it in their mouth.</li>
            <li>What has been successful is wrapping his little fingers in medical tape with cute little Band-Aids over that.</li>
            <li>I found that I need to apply this on the full surface of my son&#x27;s thumbnail on a daily basis for it to work.</li>
            <li>At first it work but eventually my three year old built up a resistance to this product</li>
            <li>I used it very sparingly as well, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how safe it would be for him (not sure what the chemical is that makes it so bitter).  </li>
            <li>The package clearly says that children 3 and under do not have fully developed taste buds so Mavala may not work on them, but we thought it was worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li>In the final days of my manicure when it starts to chip and I&#x27;m more likely to start biting my nails again, I apply Mavala rigorously to keep me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li>I think the key to success is that she really wanted to stop this too.</li>
            <li>While it tastes the same and immediately made me not want to put my fingers in my mouth, I couldn&#x27;t get it to last more than 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>gave it a break and said maybe when she gets older i will try the product again.</li>
            <li>I am now on my second since I am scared to not use it - the first bottle will last you the first 30+ days, but I found it helpful to have a fresh bottle to now use every second or third day... just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone else.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and barely has any gloss to it.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, dries fast.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would ever stop me from biting my nails when I&#x27;m nervous is a fresh manicure...</li>
            <li>We are pleased to say that she now has nail growth almost long enough to file!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s icky and pretty potent.</li>
            <li>If anything, I probably spend less time with my hands in water since we have two kids now and use the dishwasher far more than handwashing.  </li>
            <li>I will pile on all the other reviews, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>the kids will default to other available fingers.  </li>
            <li>I have to put a new layer every 2 days.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying I have run the gamut of thumb-sucking and nail biting since I was a very young child.</li>
            <li>As soon as it arrived I applied it to my daughters nails,she sucks her thumb, and right away, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and tried to wipe it off!!!</li>
            <li>Now only if the 3oz bottle came with an ample supply of ammonia and a new shirt ;)</li>
            <li>We ordered this for our 4 1/2 year old daughter, who couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>After nearly 30 years of biting my nails, it had me trained to stop in just a week!  </li>
            <li>I was an occasional biter, and this really helped put an end to biting!  </li>
            <li>then every other day since just to be sure the taste is still present just in case.</li>
            <li>My 6 yr old stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>The first time her thumb went in her mouth she pulled it out immediately \\&quot;This nail polish tastes GROSS Mom!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Once the first week and twice the next week.</li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails for probably over 15 years now and this is the first nail product I have purchased that actually works.</li>
            <li>but by the next day they were all willing, so the processes began.  </li>
            <li>Did not work at all on our two year old!  </li>
            <li>I only saw her try to put her thumb in her mouth twice during the first day and once on day 2</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job after the first application especially for thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>I tried EVERYTHING to get them to stop sucking there thumbs and was completely loosing hope, when their new dentist recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old son sucked his two first fingers CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year old was a mild fingernail and severe toe nail bitter.</li>
            <li>The bitter taste will definitely deter you from chewing on your fingernails, but I wish the flavor did not rub off onto food so easily.</li>
            <li>We figured out the problem and made sure she ate with her other hand for the first few days to avoid accidental tastings of the Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you apply it, it has the appearance of clear nail polish and leaves a shiny finish -- I think that helped him remember, because he could see it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>It is applied as a clear nail polish over the nails.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old had been sucking her thumb since she was 2 months old</li>
            <li>My 6 year old had started thumb sucking in the womb, and continued for until a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine used this product with her 4 year old and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>Completely ruined finger</li>
            <li>My (days away from being) four-year-old had sucked her thumb since she was three months old.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for our 9 year old son who has ADHD and was gnawing on his fingers nonstop.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter started biting her nails incessantly at the start of her 4th grade year.</li>
            <li>We used this on our 4 year old to get him to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>Now my 18 month old dont care about the taste that it doesnt stop him anymore from suckling even with this applied on.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter sucked her thumb until a month ago.</li>
            <li>son so far (3 days), has not been biting his nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With in a week he had completely stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>It worked and within a couple of days she stopped completely.  </li>
            <li>but if I even saw her thumb near her mouth</li>
            <li>After a week of intense fighting my daughter finally gave up because she knew this time I wouldn&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li>culturally, we eat with our hands a lot).  </li>
            <li>This has helped my 7 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, even taking it as far as wearing surgical gloves at home just to stop biting (I&#x27;m a stress biter).  </li>
            <li>You might rub your face, itch your mouth, rest your hand near your mouth, etc...</li>
            <li>My 3 year old son has been a thumb-sucker since he was an infant.</li>
            <li>We used this on our 4 year old daughter who is a thumbsucker.</li>
            <li>After just that one night, she has completely stopped sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old has a SEVERE case where he is sucking on his index fingers so severe that his fingers are blistered/callused and swollen, he&#x27;s even ripped into the skin, he&#x27;s been sucking on those fingers since birth and even in utero as a way to comfort himself.</li>
            <li>My three year old daughter has been \\&quot;thumb sucking free\\&quot; for seven days so far</li>
            <li>I used it for my 7 year old and my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>: My wife also used it for two weeks and it completely stopped her issues with chewing her nails.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s nails were really bitten back.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to get my 4 year old to stop biting including offering nail polish for not biting and my daughter could not stop.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old to help her stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am completely cured.  </li>
            <li>I no longer put my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Since it worked well on her, we put it on my 4 year old son who was biting his nails...</li>
            <li>and she is now a 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>Tried this on my four year old (and myself).  </li>
            <li>We had tried everything with my almost 6 year old to stop her from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Also,we parents must help them to stop while they are young before they ruin their teeth to the point to where they can not be fixed.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 18 months old</li>
            <li>I could get my daughter to completely weane her thumbsucking</li>
            <li>Every time my 2 yr old tried to suck her thumb</li>
            <li>The packaging does say that it is not for use on kids under 3 as their taste buds are not fully developed.</li>
            <li>now after a few days, we are thumb free AND falling asleep well again.</li>
            <li>I am 52 year old man.</li>
            <li>foster son has a 3 1/2 year old habit of sucking his fingers to the point of damaging his teeth.</li>
            <li>I think having some yucky tasting stuff on his fingers gave him conscious effort to keep his hands out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>I catch my 9 year old every now and then sucking her thumb at night.  </li>
            <li>We also applied it to the 3 year old</li>
            <li>With subsequent applications, I didn&#x27;t put as much on her.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old has been sucking her thumb since birth.</li>
            <li>My three year old daughter started sucking her finger at 4month.</li>
            <li>I used it on my four year old daughter&#x27;s thumb one time</li>
            <li>My now 7 year old daughter has sucked her thumb since she was 1.</li>
            <li>We bought this to break our 2 year old of sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Despite her numerous efforts to lose the taste by washing her hands on day one, she gave up without much of a fight.  </li>
            <li>We used this with my son when he was 3 yrs old to stop him from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and instantly my hands wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near my mouth!!!</li>
            <li>The first day we used it she mindlessly put her thumb in her mouth multiple times and then got immediately super upset because the taste got in her mouth.</li>
            <li>She could taste the bitter right away and took a nap without sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>All the warnings about the taste on the fingers affecting eating were right, though, so be careful.</li>
            <li>We still have the entire bottle for relapses, I&#x27;m going to try it to cure my older son&#x27;s nail biting habit.</li>
            <li>That small amount was more than enough to cause my kids to look at their fingers in confusion and go &amp;#34;blech&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend this if you are having the same issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>This product is like no other!</li>
            <li>After several applications of fingernail polish remover, and several harsh scrubbings with soap and a dish scrubbing sponge, most of it came off my fingers.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old suddenly took on the habit of biting his nails - frequently!  </li>
            <li>It only took about a week for him to kick the habit, and right now we&#x27;re only using it occasionally as he &#x27;relapses&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>took my 5 year old to the dentist for his biannual cleaning and she told us that, due to the thumb sucking, he&#x27;s moved his soft palate so much that he won&#x27;t have room in his mouth for his teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I know this product is a major factor of why.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that helped my 10 year old to stop sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other comments that the bitterness is intense!</li>
            <li>My son had a major pacifier habit.</li>
            <li>Deciding that I was fighting one majorly losing battle, I decided it was time to call in the reinforcements...</li>
            <li>Long story short, I grew tired of throwing away good money every month on the upkeep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other criticisms from the reviews on Amazon: fingerfood experience can easily be ruined due to Mavala.</li>
            <li>Other products we tried she was able to suck it off (while crying)</li>
            <li>smells bad but works lol</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this on our daughter who stopped sucking her thumb after the first application and on my niece (a very prolific thumb sucker) who stopped after 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter has crooked teeth from being a thumb-sucker</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of putting his thumb in his mouth</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s not the same product as far as I&#x27;m convinced</li>
            <li>I now have a 4 year old who doesn&#x27;t suck his finger anymore after only a couple of weeks on Mavala - bam, done.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that she doesn&#x27;t want to eat finger find in case she accidentally gets her thumb near her food.  </li>
            <li>Tried everything else on our 4 year old and this finally worked.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think their taste buds are developed enough for this to work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared for a rough first time with the loss of the &#x27;pacifier&#x27; and potential gastric discomfort....</li>
            <li>It had a slight hot pepper taste to it.</li>
            <li>I heavily debated whether I was ready to put her through this, but all the nagging and attempted bribes and reminders were getting old.  </li>
            <li>First one or two days, my son didn&#x27;t want to eat, and threw up a little bit after the meal.</li>
            <li>This products is so bitter, and lingers in their mouth too that they will not want to put their hands anywhere near their mouth!!</li>
            <li>general consensus is you only need 1 bottle.</li>
            <li>My son is four years old and had his thumb in his mouth almost all day long.</li>
            <li>The first few times he said it was yucky but after that, it didn&#x27;t phase him.</li>
            <li>Problem is that this product rubs off on everything, particularly if you are eating with your hands, like a sandwich, the bitterness rubs off in your food and mouth and lingers for a long long time.  </li>
            <li>The taste gets into food all day long, and my 10 year old son simply refuses to use it.</li>
            <li>The first time she just sucked it anyway, so I reapplied a few days later and</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s applied neatly or completely, just as long as there&#x27;s a little on each nail.  </li>
            <li>The polish will last for several days, and at first we had to help our little one learn to not even lick her finger when eating (</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t easily wash off which is why I think it is so effective, so not only do you get the reality slap when you forget and put your fingers in your mouth, but you are further punished for the next 5-10 minutes by trying to get the god awful taste out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old was old enough to understand the importance of stopping and he just needed that little push.  </li>

            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> It was a good price with great reviews.</li>
            <li> This product worked remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> it love it love it !!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter liked it!</li>
            <li> The product does not wash off easily which makes it very effective!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, that instinct I assumed she had that drew her thumb into her mouth ceased with a quickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing because I thought she would never stop.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled since the dentist was telling me it was now or never.  </li>
            <li> But that means that it is really, really effective.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m kind of upset she did not stop</li>
            <li> She never got used to the flavor, and we are very happy that we didn&#x27;t even come close to using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> She told us that she used Mavala on her own daughter when her daughter wanted to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> oh boy, is this stuff effective.</li>
            <li> It is so effective that it makes her gag when she gets it in her mouth.</li>
            <li> It would be excellent to stop nail biting in older children or adults.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a person with a very strong thumb addiction</li>
            <li> you will be touching any type of food while cooking or eating, make sure to wear gloves!</li>
            <li> this Mavala is by far superior!!!  </li>
            <li> If that is fixed this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first day.</li>
            <li> think that&#x27;s a good thing though, makes you VERY aware of where your hands go throughout the day</li>
            <li> After three nights, she doesn&#x27;t suck any more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li> , I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li> She still wears the Thumbuster at night - I think more for the novelty than the need but who cares??  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> He told me, \\&quot;Okay,</li>
            <li> You get a lot of product (more than you will need)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and my fingers have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product and worth the try for thumb sucking or nail biting.</li>
            <li> I am confident that we have found a solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - for the record my wife makes a killer meatloaf!  :-)</li>
            <li> I was able to stop using the product all together and still maintain my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but wonder if a change was made to cut costs or to intentionally force people to use up the product sooner so they would buy more.  </li>
            <li> This rating is by my daughter who sucked her thumb for 8 years - i have tried many products none of them worked</li>
            <li> and that was more than</li>
            <li> but it has been rather humorous to see my son&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note...</li>
            <li> Have been trying many ways to let him quit ...</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found this product which is safe for kids.</li>
            <li> Simply I have to say that this product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love it  love  </li>
            <li> Im sure it will get him to stop biting his nails and fingers in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I do not see where this stuff is safe and will not use it</li>
            <li> And my nails already look better after a week.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought this to break the habit mostly at night, but we put it on twice a day...</li>
            <li> Her hands look better and her nails are beginning to grow.  </li>
            <li> I will admit when the dentist told me about this product I wasn&#x27;t so sure that it worked.  </li>
            <li> This is an OK product, it does its job but not well.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product,and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Glad we tried it.</li>
            <li> They would mostly suck their thumbs at night when they had their blankets.  </li>
            <li> I applied it one more time just to make sure</li>
            <li> Glad I didnt have to buy those 80$ thumb covers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I put it on him, I made sure he was still okay with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried wrapping athletic tape on his thumb and it worked ok</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth any more.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s given up trying to use this on her nails, but we&#x27;ve found an even better use for this product: RABBIT CHEWING DETERRENT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many others and have paid a lot more money for something I was told would help my child stop sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> great product highly recommend</li>
            <li> many have already stated, go easy on this stuff and keep an eye on your kid while eating/drinking.  </li>
            <li> If you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, or nail biting, order this RIGHT NOW!!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, attractive like a clear nail polish, but not too shiny so that I think boys could use this without anyone noticing.</li>
            <li> We love this product and are excited to use it with my daughter who bites her nails.</li>
            <li> Drinks don&#x27;t make it go away, it lasts for 15+ minutes easily if ANY gets in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything else we tried just washed off easily.  </li>
            <li> 90 and going strong though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest the nail polish if your child doesn&#x27;t have a really strong habit</li>
            <li> but i guess his addiction was just too strong.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the very best product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering such a great product.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS</li>
            <li> All you need is a light coating of the product on your nails to keep your nails away from your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The Mavala was fantastic.</li>
            <li> When he was about 3, we finally managed to get it away from him (although he protested greatly).</li>
            <li> One day a light popped on in my head</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCE REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Go ahead and place your order - this stuff really WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> So I combine manicures and Mavala and my nails are super long and beautiful now.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to use more of it on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the Mavala Stop and was impressed and anxious to try</li>
            <li> After the first application, I put more on after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Originally I applied it as directed</li>
            <li> SUCCESS!  </li>
            <li> Based on all the other positive reviews for this product, I decided to give it a go (nail biter for the best part of 30 years).</li>
            <li> She is now very proud that she no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent and it really works.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say a child under the age of three may not have full taste buds and</li>
            <li> That being said, while I believe the product can work wonders for many, it did not accomplish the mission as fast as I wanted.</li>
            <li> He laughed about how gross it was but also asked for water to get the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> I think it works better if the child really wants to stop too.</li>
            <li> I was immediately able to stop biting my nails after biting nonstop for my whole life (28 years).</li>
            <li> However, it worked, and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li> seems to wear off quickly</li>
            <li> I talked up how we were going to be getting something to help him quick thumb sucking and nail biting before we got it.  </li>
            <li> and you quickly learn to keep hands off your face</li>
            <li> but she was quickly reminded from the taste of it that she wasn&#x27;t supposed to have her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Stopped his habit quick.</li>
            <li> , it worth it, its yucky, it can be used in kids 3yo and older, i already love it since day 1.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has not sucked her thumb since the first application!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter because the description says it&#x27;s safe for children, but the packaging states</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This tides me over until I have time to get a fresh manicure</li>
            <li> When nothing turned out to be a success, I found this product and bought it immediately.  </li>
            <li> beware, unlike the old &#x27;thumb&#x27; that was more like seasoning, this stuff is powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a year of frustration we bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHVMP8/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 recently and so far it&#x27;s been great...</li>
            <li> We tried everything for almost 2 years without success.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this product; however, I didn&#x27;t feel it did any better than the other products that I only paid about $3.50 for.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> The first time his fingernail went in his mouth resulted in a look on his face like he just took a bite of mom&#x27;sdreaded meatloaf and he quickly asked for his water.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> Bought this hoping to stop him and he would just suck right through it.</li>
            <li> I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away.</li>
            <li> He put his thumb in his mouth automatically when I tucked him in and immediately took it right out again.</li>
            <li> (right before I reapplied) and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for the first few days.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is also a good way to curb that Cheetos habit ;)</li>
            <li> On the first night we applied it (right before bedtime and during storytime), she ended up going to sleep without sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Our spoiled little Holland Lop rabbit loved to chew on our electrical cords</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Also, as a topcoat it is not very shiny and has a kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;/nonreflective texture that doesn&#x27;t look</li>
            <li> I tried the Thumbuster alone first</li>
            <li> but she \\&quot;lost\\&quot; it after the first day.  </li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is the first product I have tried.</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The month is up exactly 30 days after we first started the Mavala Stop</li>
            <li> I have been an avid nail biter</li>
            <li> Just be willing to accept that it may not work for your situation.</li>
            <li> I do it willingly and unwillingly.</li>
            <li> so just be prepared to apply it consistently</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I had nails and no desire to bite them anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it deterred Thumb-sucking from the first time we applied it.  </li>
            <li> first tried the over the counter nail biting remedy called Thumb.</li>
            <li> The first bottle has lasted over 2 months</li>
            <li> She put her thumb in her mouth after the first application, and immediately began to gag.  </li>
            <li> She must have vommited 4 times that first day.  </li>
            <li> And once it hits your tounge, it spreads over your whole mouth!  </li>
            <li> she has decided the taste is funny</li>
            <li> I also put it on to show solidarity -- and because I was also biting my own -- and let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t want to put the lingering bitter tasting stuff on my fingers ever again.</li>
            <li> This works lightening fast!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another parent said to watch for regurgitation on first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that was able to stop my son from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it..</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have a camera to record the funny faces and bottle of water.</li>
            <li> During his most recent dentist visit, the dentist told him he needed to stop sucking his thumb because he is pushing his teeth out of alignment.</li>
            <li> My daughter was reluctant to let me put it on her thumb at first</li>
            <li> But it really works!</li>
            <li> and it was pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried Thum (available at Walgreens &amp; many other retailers), which doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to Mavala STOP!  </li>
            <li> This product really is a miracle worker for me right now.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucked her thumb almost since birth, and my 9 year old has been biting her fingernails since she was about 3 were able to kick their habits in one day of using Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> So Far the product was recommended by her dentist to stop my daughter from sucking her fingers and so far it is working, so satisfied.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I applied too much, and had to eat all my food with knife and fork for the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I started biting my nails to the quick at a very young age.  </li>
            <li> The first time I painted his whole nail.</li>
            <li> If your child is ready and aware to fix it but needs some help, it works.</li>
            <li> for sure it works, i don&#x27;t bite as long as i have it on.</li>
            <li> as long as it&#x27;s memorable</li>
            <li> To which my wife replied \\&quot;are you ready to stop sucking your thumb now?\\&quot; and that was pretty much it.</li>
            <li> If not, it doesn&#x27;t work at all to certain children.</li>
            <li> Well I can share this - he certainly doesn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> This would probably work better than all other brands, but the solution is just super strong and bitter.  </li>
            <li> Yes it really does stay on for days even with washing.</li>
            <li> I think it depends on how ready your child is to stop according to my experience with my son.</li>
            <li> REAL STORY STARTS HERE.</li>
            <li> Very thankful for the recommendation from our dentist.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely convinced that the manufacturer has changed the composition of this product.  </li>
            <li> I never imagined it would work so fast.  </li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for complete success.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELP HIM QUITE.</li>
            <li> so it really helps remind them to keep their fingers out of their mouth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend Mavala!</li>
            <li> The best feeling in the world was cutting my nails with nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> But, she did quit sucking her thumb for 2 STRAIGHT days, which was a miricle in itself.  </li>
            <li> Even braces don&#x27;t fix everything,and no one wants to spend so much money on braces.</li>
            <li> My child wasn&#x27;t quite ready to stop but we bought the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Are you ready to stop?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s not quite ready.  </li>
            <li> I would not put this on very oung children.</li>
            <li> product works very well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in months thanks to this.</li>
            <li> and it really didnt work,</li>
            <li> it really</li>
            <li> and I really regretted.</li>
            <li> He is on day four and it has been going really well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;son already doesnt suck his thumb so much</li>
            <li> my girlfriend bites her nails and wants to stop so</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> However, he did want to taste my pink nail polish to see if it tasted better.</li>
            <li> So it may have really worked afterall.</li>
            <li> It work very well.</li>
            <li> tried so many different ways to stop my son&#x27;s thumb sucking and nail biting since he was 2.5 years old.</li>
            <li> The greatest thing about it was that one coating would last at least 10 days and allowed me to completely kick the nail biting habit.  </li>
            <li> He does try to wash it off, so I have to be really good about remembering to apply it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> In two weeks time she completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> The other similar products didn&#x27;t have as good reviews and some even stated they discolored the finger nail.  </li>
            <li> the product may not work due to the fact that they may not be able to taste the bitterness.  </li>
            <li> once every other day) just to make sure the habit doesn&#x27;t reappear.  </li>
            <li> The good thing with the taste is now I avoid getting my fingers near my mouth and no more biting.</li>
            <li> It is applied very easily but it spread to the tips of his fingers even after it dried so</li>
            <li> We tried this product in our first attempt to get our 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I think her habit was completely curbed within the first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was young, I&#x27;ve tried pretty everything</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to make my 4 yrs old stop sucking his thumb, I spend about $80 on the ThumbGard, that it is more complicated than a nail polish, and wow this product and for the price it is the best, it really works, only one application last about 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;(I would say, offer your child some water the first couple times they get it in their mouth.</li>
            <li> What has been successful is wrapping his little fingers in medical tape with cute little Band-Aids over that.</li>
            <li> I found that I need to apply this on the full surface of my son&#x27;s thumbnail on a daily basis for it to work.</li>
            <li> At first it work but eventually my three year old built up a resistance to this product</li>
            <li> I used it very sparingly as well, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how safe it would be for him (not sure what the chemical is that makes it so bitter).  </li>
            <li> The package clearly says that children 3 and under do not have fully developed taste buds so Mavala may not work on them, but we thought it was worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> In the final days of my manicure when it starts to chip and I&#x27;m more likely to start biting my nails again, I apply Mavala rigorously to keep me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> I think the key to success is that she really wanted to stop this too.</li>
            <li> While it tastes the same and immediately made me not want to put my fingers in my mouth, I couldn&#x27;t get it to last more than 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> gave it a break and said maybe when she gets older i will try the product again.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second since I am scared to not use it - the first bottle will last you the first 30+ days, but I found it helpful to have a fresh bottle to now use every second or third day... just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone else.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and barely has any gloss to it.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, dries fast.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would ever stop me from biting my nails when I&#x27;m nervous is a fresh manicure...</li>
            <li> We are pleased to say that she now has nail growth almost long enough to file!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s icky and pretty potent.</li>
            <li> If anything, I probably spend less time with my hands in water since we have two kids now and use the dishwasher far more than handwashing.  </li>
            <li> I will pile on all the other reviews, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> the kids will default to other available fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have to put a new layer every 2 days.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I have run the gamut of thumb-sucking and nail biting since I was a very young child.</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I applied it to my daughters nails,she sucks her thumb, and right away, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and tried to wipe it off!!!</li>
            <li> Now only if the 3oz bottle came with an ample supply of ammonia and a new shirt ;)</li>
            <li> We ordered this for our 4 1/2 year old daughter, who couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> After nearly 30 years of biting my nails, it had me trained to stop in just a week!  </li>
            <li> I was an occasional biter, and this really helped put an end to biting!  </li>
            <li> then every other day since just to be sure the taste is still present just in case.</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> The first time her thumb went in her mouth she pulled it out immediately \\&quot;This nail polish tastes GROSS Mom!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Once the first week and twice the next week.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for probably over 15 years now and this is the first nail product I have purchased that actually works.</li>
            <li> but by the next day they were all willing, so the processes began.  </li>
            <li> Did not work at all on our two year old!  </li>
            <li> I only saw her try to put her thumb in her mouth twice during the first day and once on day 2</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job after the first application especially for thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING to get them to stop sucking there thumbs and was completely loosing hope, when their new dentist recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old son sucked his two first fingers CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old was a mild fingernail and severe toe nail bitter.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste will definitely deter you from chewing on your fingernails, but I wish the flavor did not rub off onto food so easily.</li>
            <li> We figured out the problem and made sure she ate with her other hand for the first few days to avoid accidental tastings of the Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it has the appearance of clear nail polish and leaves a shiny finish -- I think that helped him remember, because he could see it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> It is applied as a clear nail polish over the nails.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old had been sucking her thumb since she was 2 months old</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had started thumb sucking in the womb, and continued for until a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine used this product with her 4 year old and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Completely ruined finger</li>
            <li> My (days away from being) four-year-old had sucked her thumb since she was three months old.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for our 9 year old son who has ADHD and was gnawing on his fingers nonstop.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter started biting her nails incessantly at the start of her 4th grade year.</li>
            <li> We used this on our 4 year old to get him to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> Now my 18 month old dont care about the taste that it doesnt stop him anymore from suckling even with this applied on.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter sucked her thumb until a month ago.</li>
            <li> son so far (3 days), has not been biting his nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With in a week he had completely stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> It worked and within a couple of days she stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> but if I even saw her thumb near her mouth</li>
            <li> After a week of intense fighting my daughter finally gave up because she knew this time I wouldn&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> culturally, we eat with our hands a lot).  </li>
            <li> This has helped my 7 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, even taking it as far as wearing surgical gloves at home just to stop biting (I&#x27;m a stress biter).  </li>
            <li> You might rub your face, itch your mouth, rest your hand near your mouth, etc...</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has been a thumb-sucker since he was an infant.</li>
            <li> We used this on our 4 year old daughter who is a thumbsucker.</li>
            <li> After just that one night, she has completely stopped sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old has a SEVERE case where he is sucking on his index fingers so severe that his fingers are blistered/callused and swollen, he&#x27;s even ripped into the skin, he&#x27;s been sucking on those fingers since birth and even in utero as a way to comfort himself.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter has been \\&quot;thumb sucking free\\&quot; for seven days so far</li>
            <li> I used it for my 7 year old and my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> : My wife also used it for two weeks and it completely stopped her issues with chewing her nails.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s nails were really bitten back.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get my 4 year old to stop biting including offering nail polish for not biting and my daughter could not stop.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old to help her stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am completely cured.  </li>
            <li> I no longer put my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Since it worked well on her, we put it on my 4 year old son who was biting his nails...</li>
            <li> and she is now a 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> Tried this on my four year old (and myself).  </li>
            <li> We had tried everything with my almost 6 year old to stop her from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Also,we parents must help them to stop while they are young before they ruin their teeth to the point to where they can not be fixed.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 18 months old</li>
            <li> I could get my daughter to completely weane her thumbsucking</li>
            <li> Every time my 2 yr old tried to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> The packaging does say that it is not for use on kids under 3 as their taste buds are not fully developed.</li>
            <li> now after a few days, we are thumb free AND falling asleep well again.</li>
            <li> I am 52 year old man.</li>
            <li> foster son has a 3 1/2 year old habit of sucking his fingers to the point of damaging his teeth.</li>
            <li> I think having some yucky tasting stuff on his fingers gave him conscious effort to keep his hands out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> I catch my 9 year old every now and then sucking her thumb at night.  </li>
            <li> We also applied it to the 3 year old</li>
            <li> With subsequent applications, I didn&#x27;t put as much on her.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has been sucking her thumb since birth.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter started sucking her finger at 4month.</li>
            <li> I used it on my four year old daughter&#x27;s thumb one time</li>
            <li> My now 7 year old daughter has sucked her thumb since she was 1.</li>
            <li> We bought this to break our 2 year old of sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Despite her numerous efforts to lose the taste by washing her hands on day one, she gave up without much of a fight.  </li>
            <li> We used this with my son when he was 3 yrs old to stop him from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and instantly my hands wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near my mouth!!!</li>
            <li> The first day we used it she mindlessly put her thumb in her mouth multiple times and then got immediately super upset because the taste got in her mouth.</li>
            <li> She could taste the bitter right away and took a nap without sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> All the warnings about the taste on the fingers affecting eating were right, though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> We still have the entire bottle for relapses, I&#x27;m going to try it to cure my older son&#x27;s nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> That small amount was more than enough to cause my kids to look at their fingers in confusion and go &amp;#34;blech&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> highly highly recommend this if you are having the same issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> This product is like no other!</li>
            <li> After several applications of fingernail polish remover, and several harsh scrubbings with soap and a dish scrubbing sponge, most of it came off my fingers.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old suddenly took on the habit of biting his nails - frequently!  </li>
            <li> It only took about a week for him to kick the habit, and right now we&#x27;re only using it occasionally as he &#x27;relapses&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> took my 5 year old to the dentist for his biannual cleaning and she told us that, due to the thumb sucking, he&#x27;s moved his soft palate so much that he won&#x27;t have room in his mouth for his teeth.  </li>
            <li> Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know this product is a major factor of why.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that helped my 10 year old to stop sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other comments that the bitterness is intense!</li>
            <li> My son had a major pacifier habit.</li>
            <li> Deciding that I was fighting one majorly losing battle, I decided it was time to call in the reinforcements...</li>
            <li> Long story short, I grew tired of throwing away good money every month on the upkeep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other criticisms from the reviews on Amazon: fingerfood experience can easily be ruined due to Mavala.</li>
            <li> Other products we tried she was able to suck it off (while crying)</li>
            <li> smells bad but works lol</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this on our daughter who stopped sucking her thumb after the first application and on my niece (a very prolific thumb sucker) who stopped after 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has crooked teeth from being a thumb-sucker</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of putting his thumb in his mouth</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s not the same product as far as I&#x27;m convinced</li>
            <li> I now have a 4 year old who doesn&#x27;t suck his finger anymore after only a couple of weeks on Mavala - bam, done.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that she doesn&#x27;t want to eat finger find in case she accidentally gets her thumb near her food.  </li>
            <li> Tried everything else on our 4 year old and this finally worked.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think their taste buds are developed enough for this to work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared for a rough first time with the loss of the &#x27;pacifier&#x27; and potential gastric discomfort....</li>
            <li> It had a slight hot pepper taste to it.</li>
            <li> I heavily debated whether I was ready to put her through this, but all the nagging and attempted bribes and reminders were getting old.  </li>
            <li> First one or two days, my son didn&#x27;t want to eat, and threw up a little bit after the meal.</li>
            <li> This products is so bitter, and lingers in their mouth too that they will not want to put their hands anywhere near their mouth!!</li>
            <li> general consensus is you only need 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> My son is four years old and had his thumb in his mouth almost all day long.</li>
            <li> The first few times he said it was yucky but after that, it didn&#x27;t phase him.</li>
            <li> Problem is that this product rubs off on everything, particularly if you are eating with your hands, like a sandwich, the bitterness rubs off in your food and mouth and lingers for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> The taste gets into food all day long, and my 10 year old son simply refuses to use it.</li>
            <li> The first time she just sucked it anyway, so I reapplied a few days later and</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s applied neatly or completely, just as long as there&#x27;s a little on each nail.  </li>
            <li> The polish will last for several days, and at first we had to help our little one learn to not even lick her finger when eating (</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t easily wash off which is why I think it is so effective, so not only do you get the reality slap when you forget and put your fingers in your mouth, but you are further punished for the next 5-10 minutes by trying to get the god awful taste out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old was old enough to understand the importance of stopping and he just needed that little push.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to reapply the Mavala every few days for the next couple months just to make sure she&#x27;s broken the habit completely.  </li>
            <li> But a few months later, she started sucking again, and when we reapplied the Thum, she sucked right through the bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> I wish that it was ok to put on every day instead of every other day though, because my child sucks his thumb every other day now.</li>
            <li> It was hard to not laugh at my daughter&#x27;s perplexed look when she started sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> but obviously that didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> now used this again to stop our, now, older daughter&#x27;s nail biting habit with just a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , they should make this stuff in tiny sample sizes, because it only took one initial application of a single coat and one single-coat reapplication after 2 days and it&#x27;s now been over two weeks of no thumb-sucking.  </li>
            <li> guess my only other complaint is that I&#x27;m now stuck with a basically full bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li> Maybe she is just an avid thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> She had been an avid thumb sucker since she was in the womb.</li>
            <li> My 6yr old would bite his fingernails down to the point where they would bleed a bit.</li>
            <li> After much screaming and yelling at both my wife and kid and getting it on her nails (which is the hard part) my kid finally gave in when she knew I didn&#x27;t care what it would take to make her stop.</li>
            <li> I mean this in a good way, but it was the most disgusting taste ever and even made it hard to eat certain meals because of making contact with my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old who have both been thumb suckers since they were in utero.  </li>
            <li> We tried everything- positive reinforcement (treats, rewards) and negative reinforcement (punishments).</li>
            <li> So, I believe this stuff is great, if you don&#x27;t have a week stomach, or a bad gag reflex!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty common for polish to disappear from the nails after a couple days, so I expected the same with this.</li>
            <li> We tried other similar products from the local drugstore and they didn&#x27;t even dent our sons thumb-sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop polish is more expensive than other things,but</li>
            <li> However, I went ahead and bought it, had a little chat with my 4 year old about what was going to happen if she put her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li> No more fear of our sweet little bunny getting electrocuted!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this stuff with my three year old toddler,and I&#x27;ve tried other stuff,and the other stuff does not work.</li>
            <li> It has lasted a long time and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The Mavala lasts for a long time on the nails and has a horrendous taste to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be driving, then suddenly have a bitter taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get too long winded on this one.</li>
            <li> The taste if you do is just bitter enough to make you stop.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely reccommend using a fork for those if you want to avoid the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Also, for the men trying to stop biting, this product isn&#x27;t overly shiny, so you won&#x27;t get strange looks from people that think that you polish your nails.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it&#x27;s a gross and unhealthy habit, her fingers were starting to peel and crack and daycare wasn&#x27;t helping much...</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I remember.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid for the glove a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don&#x27;t accidentally get any in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The taste is bitter and lasts long enough to change behavior.  </li>
            <li> I applied it last night and less than 12 hours later it has already diminished.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm and only needs to be applied every other day.  </li>
            <li> He would stick his little fingers in his mouth, suck for a second, say  &amp;#34;mouth was stinky&amp;#34; and I think it was only a couple days that he even tried it again</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other things, including several liquids.  </li>
            <li> Following the reviews by the other people on this product,  I decided to start using this product on her over a weekend so that I can handle the mishaps.  </li>
            <li> I choose this product because it was cheaper and easier than several other versions I was looking at.  </li>
            <li> you only need a tiny bit as other reviewers stated (at least with the young ones...)  </li>
            <li> It wasnt on there very long...</li>
            <li> Be very careful to only brush it on the tops of the nails.</li>
            <li> The first time the Mavala was put on all of his fingers, our son was aware that it would taste bad.</li>
            <li> It does dry shiny, just in case that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago for my 3 year old daughter who sucks her two middle fingers.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop for my 3 year old daughter who sucks her thumb, constantly.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work initially but now my 4 yr old kid has gotten used to the taste and now sucks it off.</li>
            <li> My daughter gagged and had a tough time recovering when she put her thumb in the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is a habit that is very difficult to stop, I&#x27;m sure you know.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it!&amp;#34; He went down for his nap and is currently snoring - without his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> A week or so later, I tried again, with only a small dab on the tip of his thumbnail.</li>
            <li> :  Only apply a little to the tip of the thumb.  </li>
            <li> We are going to prepare her and talk to her about it while still applying it to only one thumb for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take couple more months to get rid off this bad habit</li>
            <li> It does taste bad but his desire to suck his thumb is greater than his desire not to taste the Mavala Stop product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend put it on at least daily, though, so the taste stays potent enough to ward off bad habits.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old grandson is a thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend quit his nails biting but my 4 year old daughter still sucks her thumbs.  </li>
            <li> I have a 3.5 year old thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> The taste is a bitter one that does linger on, and on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the pink Thumbuster</li>
            <li> He did have a bit of a relapse a few months later but we just reapplied and once again he stopped.  </li>
            <li> Then, he started careful about putting his fingers to his mouth.</li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> the bitter taste will transfer to the foods you are making and ruin the taste.  </li>
            <li> We only applied this product a few times and it has been 2 months</li>
            <li> I would note that you should be careful when eating food with your hands (e.g., sandwiches, etc.)</li>
            <li> and you wont realise it until you lick your lips and realise the horrid bitter taste is somewhere</li>
            <li> The taste is incredibly bitter and literally almost makes you gag.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped biting my nails within a few days.</li>
            <li> But,it&#x27;s better than him sucking his thumb and making all those loud annoying suckling noises all day everyday.</li>
            <li> She had bitten her big toe nails about half off!</li>
            <li> Used it on my 22 month old - after one night&#x27;s application he has not sucked his thumb for the past 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on myself and it left a bitter taste in my mouth for hours from just one small taste.</li>
            <li> My child WAS a major thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> think, for kids, if they are old enough to understand why you are putting the polish on and the importance of stopping it&#x27;s a wonderful product (with a HORRIBLE taste) to break bad habits.</li>
            <li> I was a pretty incurable nail biter.</li>
            <li> I used the Mavala Stop on her thumb nail and after one small taste she was begging for the Thumbuster back.  </li>
            <li> Daughter told me she was going to suck it off and just keep sucking her thumb like she has done with all other products we have used.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been applying it about every other day and have not been biting our nails</li>
            <li> product, NASTY taste, EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> I have tried other no bite things to get my daughter to quit sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> that stuff tastes really bitter!</li>
            <li> the other kids will tease you about sucking your thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all other products and tricks and have had no luck.</li>
            <li> This would work temporarily but she would eventually suck on the glove or start sucking other fingers.</li>
            <li> We tried other methods to get her to stop.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> If you eat a sandwich or other finger food, you will taste the bitterness.</li>
            <li> You need to re-apply every other day to maintain effectiveness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the advice of other reviewers, I put on a small amount on the tips of my kid&#x27;s fingers and thumbs only.  </li>
            <li> , if you eat anything with your fingers... be careful or you might taste bitter with it!!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;It tastes very bitter.</li>
            <li> It has a very bitter taste to it.</li>
            <li> VERY bitter.</li>
            <li> Very bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 days, he kept forgetting and putting his fingers in his mouth only to be surprised by the bad taste!  </li>
            <li> I tried other products but this won hands down.</li>
            <li> If you bite your nails I highly suggest you try the product because the taste is so bad you&#x27;ll avoid your hands near your mouth.</li>
            <li> We had tried the over the counter polish and had no success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this on my youngest son because he still sucks on his fingers.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so bitter, it&#x27;s really harsh.</li>
            <li> so glad she is not sucking her thumb anymore as it use to be so annoying when she sleeps...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible (which is a good thing).  </li>
            <li> All in all it came down to a battle of wills.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll save it for any issues down the road.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids (ages 4 &amp; 5 respectively) have little habits that are less than desired: one thumb sucks, the other is a nail and toenail biter.  </li>
            <li> In 2-3 days, after applying it on her nails, she has stopped sucking her thumb, she knows it tastes very bitter!</li>
            <li> for the taste, my husband was initially hesitant that this would work, since he supposedly ate through a whole bunch of bad tasting nail polish as a child.</li>
            <li> This stopped him, and changed the habit in less than one week.</li>
            <li> Less that 1 min..</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it yet.  </li>
            <li> I guess this might work on someone with less of an ingrained habit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half convinced that our son just has to outgrow this stage.</li>
            <li> It worked almost instantly, and within a week I had creepy regular length fingernails.</li>
            <li> You do get *slightly</li>
            <li> and it was difficult keeping her away from them when we open her cage several hours a day for her to exercise and spend time with our family.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that this stuff is so powerful that you can&#x27;t really eat small things with your hands without making your food taste terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say it smells and tastes like polish remover but its a little thicker in order to sty on.</li>
            <li> She then would take the bottle from me and dab a little on her thumbs</li>
            <li> We just put a little dab on her thumbnail at bedtime as soon as we received it.</li>
            <li> I literally put one swipe of the liquid on her nail because I read a lot of reviews that said not to overdo the application on little ones.&lt;br /&gt;She tried to suck her thumb just once...</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala Stop of my little girl to try to help her stop sucking her finger.</li>
            <li> With other products I could get past the taste and still bite my nails.  </li>
            <li> It is a taste that will linger in your mouth for a little while if you accidentally put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;d hear little gagging noises, and after an hour she stopped trying.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> We &#x27;painted&#x27; the Mavala up and down the electrical cords and Voila!  </li>
            <li> It was $10 dollars well spent!!!</li>
            <li> It tastes so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for kids younger than 3 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have been a nail bitter since I can remember, its actually gotten so bad my teeth were starting to wear in the front!</li>
            <li> Every time I tried not only it failed but also it had a bad emotional side effect to my son, very cranky all the time.</li>
            <li> Actually I can&#x27;t get my fingers even near my mouth because the product tastes so bad.</li>
            <li> so we just reapplied it to her thumb every few days.</li>
            <li> We tried to stop our daughter&#x27;s thumb sucking with Thum a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product on my son who has trouble with thumb-sucking.</li>
            <li> Seems that it will wash off after a few hand washes or a shower.</li>
            <li> every few</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few years ago and within 2 weeks, I stopped biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> ONE OF MY SON HAD RELAPSED A FEW TIMES FROM THUMB SUCKING, AND USING BOTH PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep reapplying every few days while he&#x27;s asleep to ensure those nails get ample time to grow out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful and is very strong...</li>
            <li> He is well aware this habit is bad</li>
            <li> they been 5 hours without bitting the nails, my 4yo daughter its even spitting it out, and my husband telling me how yucky, disgusting and terrible it is, LOL, I can feel already a success in this bitting nails battle, so</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even slow her down...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work for my little guy, he seems to be ok with the taste (as dreadful as it is) Yuck!</li>
            <li> In the first few days of use, my daughter was pleasantly disgusted several times a day from putting her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would look like clear nail polish</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t like to waste money!</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of things in the past to quit it and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I just tried a small amount</li>
            <li> After gagging for a few seconds, she bagan to vomit!  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write a review...</li>
            <li> i tasted it it does taste horrible and would probably work for most people.</li>
            <li> He was anxious to stop sucking his thumb, so we went ahead.</li>
            <li> My children said Mavale has the most horrible taste EVER...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bitting my nails for the past 24 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to get this on when she sleeps every other night, but that is what seems to work.  </li>
            <li> My son sucks his thumb until the skin is raw.</li>
            <li> I have chewed my nails my whole life and it is such a disgusting habit.  </li>
            <li> Once they&#x27;re bitten off - it&#x27;s hard for me to quit biting them</li>
            <li> We could not get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb for anything and this little gem worked!!</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters, all hard core thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old wanted to stop her bad habit of chewing her nails, so I found Mavala.  </li>
            <li> My son used to be a night time finger sucker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any parent that has a child that sucks their fingers.</li>
            <li> I told him it was icky and even tried some myself.</li>
            <li> She sucks her thumb every night, all night and sometimes during the day as well.  </li>
            <li> Also... and I don&#x27;t want to sound cruel...</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that my daughter no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> and she sucks if off while giggling.</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> but she just switched thumbs that she sucks</li>
            <li> then confused tongue/lip smacking after a few seconds of sucking.  </li>
            <li> It did wonders for mine, as soon as that stuff was on his nails, no more fingers in his mouth!</li>
            <li> My wife thinks I am mean for putting this on his thumb.</li>
            <li> No more destroyed cords!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what caused it, maybe the bad taste left in his mouth?</li>
            <li> I have tried other bad tasting polishes with no success.  </li>
            <li> We were very skeptical of this being any different.  </li>
            <li> but I know as a parent that it was less painful for her now then braces would be in the future (and way less expensive for my family!).</li>
            <li> He did it all night, seriously all the time.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, and the flavor will linger in your mouth for a long time if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY tastes bad!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering the product again because I ran out and slid back into my bad habit.</li>
            <li> We tried everything with my daughter: pennies when she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb, a glove that covered her thumb, and a different brand of bad tasting nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The trouble is that when she tries to eat &#x27;finger foods&#x27;, the awful taste ruins the meal for her.  </li>
            <li> Now one month later I have 3 daughters that are NOT thumb suckers!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I rated this product a 5 because it delivers exactly what it promises: an absolutely disgusting topcoat that discourages nail biting.</li>
            <li> Now, I must warn, that one night  was pretty terrible.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product for all the finger suckers and nail biters!</li>
            <li> After using this he praises this product to everyone as being the worst tasting nail polish he has ever used and that IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tastes a little bit like the exhaust from a car&#x27;s tailpipe and a dirty sock.</li>
            <li> Poor guy.  </li>
            <li> She tried sucking her thumb once, looked really confused, said that her thumb was &amp;#34;way yucky,&amp;#34; and hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.</li>
            <li> Now my son is in kindergarten, his nail biting gets worse and worse.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;She Pulled her thumb out of her mouth with a confused look on her face, looked at her thumb, sniffed it, and then put her hand on her lap.</li>
            <li> Use it only at the base of the thumbnail because it can interfere with eating.</li>
            <li> Also yes, it really does taste nasty.</li>
            <li> Habit broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again.</li>
            <li> the worse off she</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other bad tasting liquids designed to stop thumb sucking but she would suck or wash them off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obviously disappointed and looking into other options.</li>
            <li> Every time my finger gets near my mouth, I get that horrible taste and immediately stop chewing!</li>
            <li> but if they are addicted to their fingers like mine is it might not help unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days.</li>
            <li> This product just arrived in the mail today and I painted a little at the base of his thumb nail.</li>
            <li> My 5 y.o. daughter then decided to tough it out and tolerate the nasty bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter did not mind it one bit.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately my daughter has picked up the habit of biting her nails (and sucking her thumb).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t bite my nails for quite a while after that.</li>
            <li> I am sad that it is all gone, but if I still had some, I would continue using it for our thumb-sucking issue.</li>
            <li> or it is useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I was a bit wary of putting something on my child&#x27;s thumb that might make her throw up.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried it my self, to see what the big deal was, and this stuff is horrible!  </li>
            <li> My husband and I were skeptical that this would get our 3-year-old to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person&#x27;s hands can be.</li>
            <li> but it failed to work</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product, if it were for me, it would definatley work, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t phase my son.</li>
            <li> - NEVER been this long without chewing my stubs until now, and I owe it all to the completely disgusting Mavala!</li>
            <li> And let me tell you it is the worst tasting stuff, the taste lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is truly awful tasting because it is extremely bitter.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a less cruel option than some products on the market.</li>
            <li> As others mentioned she gave me a real tough time for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I even gave it a little taste and can confirm it&#x27;s nasty stuff!  </li>
            <li> She basically quit thumbsucking cold turkey both day and night (since we couldn&#x27;t get it off).</li>
            <li> and she stopped cold turkey.</li>
            <li> One application for each stopped this practice cold.</li>
            <li> It was hard to do (she cried from the horrible taste)</li>
            <li> but it seems that&#x27;s very difficult for him to stop.</li>
            <li> He drank about 5 glasses of water and yelled about how bad it was....  </li>
            <li> This product tastes so bad that you will never bite your nails again.</li>
            <li> He never mentioned taste bad or anything, he kept sucking his thumb and biting nails as if nothing was on his nails.</li>
            <li> but this is so bad tasting</li>
            <li> it will happen and you will taste how bad this stuff is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> The taste is so bad it stays in your mouth for 5-10 min.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally this would be considered a bad feature of a product, but in the case of Mayala STOP, I believe this effect was intended.</li>
            <li> The bad part is.......</li>
            <li> We told our son that if he kept sucking his thumb it would start to taste bad.</li>
            <li> all 3 girls cried because the taste was so bad...</li>
            <li> Maybe my child just doesn&#x27;t mind bad tasting stuff.  </li>
            <li> I tasted this myself and it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I would keep my fingers out of my mouth if I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> The taste of this stuff is terrible and worse yet it lingers.</li>
            <li> The taste is god awful and was makes it worse is that even if you touch your face or lips with this product on it will make you stop.</li>
            <li> I bought this to prevent myself from getting sick from accidentally biting my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and BLECH</li>
            <li> Tested on myself and it&#x27;s very unpleasant tasting (should do the trick).</li>
            <li> just the thought of that nasty taste stops me cold!</li>
            <li> My child absolutely HATED having it put on.</li>
            <li> He hated the taste of it</li>
            <li> He was very unhappy and kept saying, &amp;#34;No!</li>
            <li> but it tastes utterly disgusting.</li>
            <li> I applied on my thumb and tried tasting, it is horrible (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do)!</li>
            <li> Mavala is really, really nasty.</li>
            <li> But if you are as insane as I am, you might still bite your nails despite having a coat of this on.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful.  </li>
            <li> It tastes something terrible and be warned when eating finger foods.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible but that is why it works!</li>
            <li> this stuff tastes sooo awful it works!!</li>
            <li> My child showed reactions, and said it&#x27;s taste very bad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so nasty!!)</li>
            <li> I felt terrible for her, and if it would have gone on for nights on end, I would have stopped using the product, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> so she wouldn&#x27;t wake up with the nasty taste!</li>
            <li> My son thinks its horrible.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose and will help you kick that nasty habit once and for all!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever miss and get any on your fingers though,because the stuff will leave you with the worst taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Every time I put my fingers to my mouth,I would get the nasty taste.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for our almost 4-year-old son who had adopted the nasty habit of putting his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It tastes awful, so it does the job of breaking the habit.  </li>
            <li> I accidently got some on my finger and this stuff is nasty.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would give 5 stars to something that tastes so nasty, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stuff tastes nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter because the description says it&#x27;s safe for children, but the packaging states it&#x27;s not for children under 3. Had I known this I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had been sucking her thumb since she was 2 months old (I think she must have sucked in the womb too).  Nothing else worked but this.  After three nights, she doesn&#x27;t suck any more.  It is truly awful tasting because it is extremely bitter.  The taste does not go away unless you brush your teeth or eat something.  It doesn&#x27;t come off with hand washing, but only with nail polish remover.  It tastes so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for kids younger than 3 years old.  It worked well for us.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had started thumb sucking in the womb, and continued for until a couple of weeks ago. We painted her nails with the Mavala, and it worked that night. I was so impressed. The taste is a bitter one that does linger on, and on. I think that is why it stopped her. We are now 10 days into this, and she hasn&#x27;t had any relapse. I recommended this to our dentist as well.</li>
            <li> I have chewed my nails my whole life and it is such a disgusting habit.  This product is the only nail application that has worked for me.  The taste is bitter and lasts long enough to change behavior.  I&#x27;m ordering the product again because I ran out and slid back into my bad habit.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has crooked teeth from being a thumb-sucker so we were looking for a way to get her to stop thumb-sucking. A friend of mine used this product with her 4 year old and it worked like a charm. The package clearly says that children 3 and under do not have fully developed taste buds so Mavala may not work on them, but we thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on myself and it left a bitter taste in my mouth for hours from just one small taste. Unfortunately, my daughter did not mind it one bit. We painted several coats on in one day and it did not phase her. It was obvious that it did not affect her taste buds like it did mine. It would be excellent to stop nail biting in older children or adults. The taste is so yucky that you would not want to put your nails in your mouth at all.</li>
            <li> We tried this product in our first attempt to get our 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  It worked like a charm!  We used it for only about 4 days before she stopped attempting to put her thumb in her mouth.  I even gave it a little taste and can confirm it&#x27;s nasty stuff!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 7. I&#x27;ve tried everything...no bite, acrylic nails, etc. and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop. Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...I stopped bitting my nails on day 1. I don&#x27;t know what is in it but it tastes utterly disgusting. Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days. Completely ruined finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here we are, 5 weeks later, and my nails are longer than I&#x27;ve seen them in years. I stopped using Mavala about 2 weeks ago and have not wanted to bite my nails since. that is big! But as a safety, I keep the bottle in my purse just in case I get an inkling to bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> We ordered this for our 4 1/2 year old daughter, who couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb! In 2-3 days, after applying it on her nails, she has stopped sucking her thumb, she knows it tastes very bitter! We&#x27;ve tried Thum (available at Walgreens &amp; many other retailers), which doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to Mavala STOP!  If you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, or nail biting, order this RIGHT NOW!!  This stuff works, period!  I applied on my thumb and tried tasting, it is horrible (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do)! This is a must if you want your child to stop sucking their thumb or nail biting!</li>
            <li> I was a pretty incurable nail biter. The only thing that would ever stop me from biting my nails when I&#x27;m nervous is a fresh manicure...because I don&#x27;t like to waste money! ;) Mavala is really, really nasty. But if you are as insane as I am, you might still bite your nails despite having a coat of this on. So I combine manicures and Mavala and my nails are super long and beautiful now. In the final days of my manicure when it starts to chip and I&#x27;m more likely to start biting my nails again, I apply Mavala rigorously to keep me from biting my nails. This tides me over until I have time to get a fresh manicure again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other criticisms from the reviews on Amazon: fingerfood experience can easily be ruined due to Mavala. Also, as a topcoat it is not very shiny and has a kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;/nonreflective texture that doesn&#x27;t look that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rated this product a 5 because it delivers exactly what it promises: an absolutely disgusting topcoat that discourages nail biting.</li>
            <li> My (days away from being) four-year-old had sucked her thumb since she was three months old.  I bought this product along with the pink Thumbuster and she stopped within 3 days.  I tried the Thumbuster alone first but she \\&quot;lost\\&quot; it after the first day.  I used the Mavala Stop on her thumb nail and after one small taste she was begging for the Thumbuster back.  So, basically the Thumbuster ended up protecting her from the Mavala taste!  But, that worked.  She still wears the Thumbuster at night - I think more for the novelty than the need but who cares??  She is so proud that she has stopped sucking her thumb and I&#x27;m thrilled since the dentist was telling me it was now or never.  :)  I definitely recommend this product.  It was hard to do (she cried from the horrible taste) but I know as a parent that it was less painful for her now then braces would be in the future (and way less expensive for my family!).</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful.  But that means that it is really, really effective.  After nearly 30 years of biting my nails, it had me trained to stop in just a week!  It will get in your mouth if you&#x27;re eating appetizers by hand though, so that&#x27;s the downside.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old grandson is a thumb sucker.  So someone recommended Mavala. It initially worked.  He couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of putting his thumb in his mouth BUT he&#x27;s since gotten use to the taste and has his thumb back in.  I guess I have to use more of it on a consistent basis.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> We had tried the over the counter polish and had no success.  This product worked within 2 weeks.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My son used to be a night time finger sucker. We purchased this last year and it worked immediately! My son no longer puts his fingers in his mouth at night.&lt;br /&gt;When we do catch him absent mindedly biting his nails now we just threaten to put this stuff on and he yanks his hand away from his mouth. It has lasted a long time and does what it says it will do. This item shipped quickly and was exactly what we needed. Thank you for offering such a great product.</li>
            <li> i bought this product For my husband and daughter, apply on both of them today as soon as i got it, and guess what! they been 5 hours without bitting the nails, my 4yo daughter its even spitting it out, and my husband telling me how yucky, disgusting and terrible it is, LOL, I can feel already a success in this bitting nails battle, so exited.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!, it worth it, its yucky, it can be used in kids 3yo and older, i already love it since day 1.</li>
            <li> The day after my daughter turned three I bought this product. IT worked in 2 days. She could taste the bitter right away and took a nap without sucking her thumb. She naps with a blanket and I showed her how to rub the corner of the blanket on her nose/mouth instead of sucking her thumb. We used the polish for 4 days to remind her, and after a week she was totally done. Worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I have run the gamut of thumb-sucking and nail biting since I was a very young child. For the longest, about ten years, my only recourse was to get my nails done with acrylic tips to keep my nails from being bitten and them growing. Long story short, I grew tired of throwing away good money every month on the upkeep. So, I needed something that was going to keep my from biting. Well, this product is it! It tastes something terrible and be warned when eating finger foods. It is like Mavala has something in it soak through your fingertips or something! I got around it eating with a fork. It has been three weeks with no biting and I have visible growth. I have tried, yes, but upon my fingers getting to my lips--UUUGGGHHH!!!! The taste is gross! No biting. lol</li>
            <li> I ordered this for our 9 year old son who has ADHD and was gnawing on his fingers nonstop.  Poor guy.  We had tried everything else and nothing worked.  We talked about using this product and how it would help him.  He told me, \\&quot;Okay, I&#x27;m ready.\\&quot;  I applied this one time.  He accidentally tasted it putting food into his mouth.  He drank about 5 glasses of water and yelled about how bad it was....  we are now 4 weeks later.  His nails are growing.  He hasn&#x27;t bitten them since.  I am overjoyed.  The bottle is sitting on the counter and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it again.  I haven&#x27;t needed to.  When you apply it, it has the appearance of clear nail polish and leaves a shiny finish -- I think that helped him remember, because he could see it.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My 9 year old daughter started biting her nails incessantly at the start of her 4th grade year. We were both looking forward to curbing the habit after looking at pictures online of long-time nail biters. I think the key to success is that she really wanted to stop this too. Mavala Stop is the first product I have tried. It was a good price with great reviews. It is easy to apply, attractive like a clear nail polish, but not too shiny so that I think boys could use this without anyone noticing. In the first few days of use, my daughter was pleasantly disgusted several times a day from putting her fingers in her mouth. I think her habit was completely curbed within the first week. Yay! We&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks. We have slacked off from applying it every 2 days. When my daughter has noticed herself biting a nail during the day, she voluntarily reapplies the Mavala Stop. We are pleased to say that she now has nail growth almost long enough to file! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for putting an end to thumb sucking. Daughter told me she was going to suck it off and just keep sucking her thumb like she has done with all other products we have used. But 1st application proved she couldn&#x27;t stand the taste. I&#x27;d like to say it smells and tastes like polish remover but its a little thicker in order to sty on. Yes it really does stay on for days even with washing.</li>
            <li> We used this on our 4 year old to get him to stop sucking his thumb.  It worked after just 2 days.  He did have a bit of a relapse a few months later but we just reapplied and once again he stopped.  You get a lot of product (more than you will need) so if you have any relapses you are covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Only apply a little to the tip of the thumb.  You DON&#x27;T need a lot of product to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Based on all the other positive reviews for this product, I decided to give it a go (nail biter for the best part of 30 years). I have chewed through some foul tasting products in my time, but this stuff is persistent! It doesn&#x27;t easily wash off which is why I think it is so effective, so not only do you get the reality slap when you forget and put your fingers in your mouth, but you are further punished for the next 5-10 minutes by trying to get the god awful taste out of your mouth. Suffice to say, you change your habit pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general consensus is you only need 1 bottle. I am now on my second since I am scared to not use it - the first bottle will last you the first 30+ days, but I found it helpful to have a fresh bottle to now use every second or third day... just to be sure. 90 and going strong though - NEVER been this long without chewing my stubs until now, and I owe it all to the completely disgusting Mavala!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was young, I&#x27;ve tried pretty everything and this has been the only thing that has worked. I get manicure twice a month then apply Mavala Stop to my nails afterwards. It tastes horrible but that is why it works! Every time my finger gets near my mouth, I get that horrible taste and immediately stop chewing! I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and my fingers have never looked better. My nails and skin around my fingers have recovered and continue to heal. I&#x27;ve actually noticed that even subconsciously I stop myself... just the thought of that nasty taste stops me cold!</li>
            <li> Well, this worked only in the beginning which i only use every 2-3 days at a time. Now my 18 month old dont care about the taste that it doesnt stop him anymore from suckling even with this applied on.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter sucked her thumb until a month ago. We&#x27;ve tried other bad tasting liquids designed to stop thumb sucking but she would suck or wash them off. This one can&#x27;t be washed off. We actually tried. I starts to lose it&#x27;s potency after 2-3 days so we just reapplied it to her thumb every few days. The first day we used it she mindlessly put her thumb in her mouth multiple times and then got immediately super upset because the taste got in her mouth. I just gave her a couple orange Tic-Tacs every time that happened. By day 2, she only forgot once. She basically quit thumbsucking cold turkey both day and night (since we couldn&#x27;t get it off). I promised her she could get her ears pierced as a reward after a month of not sucking her thumb. The month is up exactly 30 days after we first started the Mavala Stop and she will be getting her ears pierced this Sunday. I will continue to reapply the Mavala every few days for the next couple months just to make sure she&#x27;s broken the habit completely.  I never write reviews but I&#x27;m so impressed I felt compelled this time.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid nail biter my entire life and unfortunately my daughter has picked up the habit of biting her nails (and sucking her thumb). After buying some no-bite from Target with no luck we bought this product.The taste of this stuff is terrible and worse yet it lingers. My daughter and I have been applying it about every other day and have not been biting our nails and she quit sucking her thumb. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been a nail bitter since I can remember, its actually gotten so bad my teeth were starting to wear in the front! I have tried alot of things in the past to quit it and nothing worked. I tried this product and instantly my hands wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near my mouth!!! this stuff tastes sooo awful it works!! my younger brother who is the same as I am saw my results and is currently in the process of purchasing some for him!!! great product highly recommend</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I applied it to my daughters nails,she sucks her thumb, and right away, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and tried to wipe it off!!! Its been three weeks.!!!  I did however caught her sucking her thumb a couple of days ago but I applied the Mavala and she has not done it since!!  THIS PRODUCE REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> my son stops sucking his thumb in 1 day. wonderful product, love it! i will recommend to anyone with needs definitely!</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first few days. My 5 y.o. daughter then decided to tough it out and tolerate the nasty bitter taste. I think it&#x27;s a good product and worth the try for thumb sucking or nail biting. Just be willing to accept that it may not work for your situation. I think this is a less cruel option than some products on the market.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;My son so far (3 days), has not been biting his nails.&lt;br /&gt;So I think is a great deal.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend quit his nails biting but my 4 year old daughter still sucks her thumbs.  Maybe she is just an avid thumb sucker.  I bought it for her so I&#x27;m kind of upset she did not stop</li>
            <li> My son is four years old and had his thumb in his mouth almost all day long. With in a week he had completely stopped sucking his thumb. I would recommend this for any parent that has a child that sucks their fingers.</li>
            <li> Our 4 year-old would not stop sucking his thumb. We tried everything- positive reinforcement (treats, rewards) and negative reinforcement (punishments). The dentist showed us how his thumb sucking was damaging his teeth and mouth. I read the reviews about this product and gave it a try. I applied this once and he never sucked his thumb again. He put his thumb in his mouth one time, made a face, and that was it. I wish we had used this sooner. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful and is very strong...definitely does the job of deterring nail-biting!!  It does dry shiny, just in case that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband in attempt to help him curb his nail biting habit. It is applied very easily but it spread to the tips of his fingers even after it dried so when he ate finger foods such as wings, the wings took on the taste of the polish. he stopped using it because of this.</li>
            <li> We tried to stop our daughter&#x27;s thumb sucking with Thum a few months ago.  It worked and within a couple of days she stopped completely.  But a few months later, she started sucking again, and when we reapplied the Thum, she sucked right through the bitter taste.  Then we decided to buy Mavala.  It worked like a charm and only needs to be applied every other day.  There is no way she can keep her thumb in her mouth now.</li>
            <li> My child WAS a major thumb sucker. She just turned 10 and was ruining her teeth. She has now stop sucking her thumb. The Mavala lasts for a long time on the nails and has a horrendous taste to it. My child absolutely HATED having it put on. Every time I tried she would scream and throw a fit and hide behind my wife. After much screaming and yelling at both my wife and kid and getting it on her nails (which is the hard part) my kid finally gave in when she knew I didn&#x27;t care what it would take to make her stop. She then would take the bottle from me and dab a little on her thumbs so I wouldn&#x27;t lather it on. Then she promised she wouldn&#x27;t suck her thumb if I let her pass putting it on every night. So, I told her I would give her one chance but if I even saw her thumb near her mouth I wouldn&#x27;t cut her a break. All in all it came down to a battle of wills. I WON... After a week of intense fighting my daughter finally gave up because she knew this time I wouldn&#x27;t stop. She is now very proud that she no longer sucks her thumb. She even had my wife take her to the dentist so she could tell him that she has stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> My toddller didn&#x27;t gag and the bitterness was enough the stop him from sucking during the day. It didn&#x27;t stop him from thumbsucking to sleep because he got used to the taste so we took a break from it and will try again to stop the nighttime thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to make my 4 yrs old stop sucking his thumb, I spend about $80 on the ThumbGard, that it is more complicated than a nail polish, and wow this product and for the price it is the best, it really works, only one application last about 4-5 days. We just started using it, but I believe at some point he won&#x27;t even think about putting his thumb in his mouth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I  have invested on.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my son who has trouble with thumb-sucking. The first time I painted his whole nail. Upon tasting it, he began to gag, and spit up. I removed it with nail polish remover, and scrubbed his thumb. A week or so later, I tried again, with only a small dab on the tip of his thumbnail. It didn&#x27;t cause the same reaction, but he was quite reluctant to put his thumb in his mouth. As I screwed the cap back on, I dropped the bottle on the tile floor, and it broke! My husband whisked our son out of the room while I picked up the glass on the floor. When I washed my hands, I realized they were covered in Mavala Stop. After several applications of fingernail polish remover, and several harsh scrubbings with soap and a dish scrubbing sponge, most of it came off my fingers. It remained under my fingernails for days, though. Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t bite my nails for quite a while after that. I am sad that it is all gone, but if I still had some, I would continue using it for our thumb-sucking issue.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost four and has been sucking her thumb since she was a baby. On her last trip to the dentist we were told that her thumb sucking was starting to damage her bite and it needed to stop soon. We tried to talk to her and she would always say that she didn&#x27;t want to suck her thumb and that she would stop but obviously that didn&#x27;t last too long. We bought this product to help. We just put a little dab on her thumbnail at bedtime as soon as we received it. She tried sucking her thumb once, looked really confused, said that her thumb was &amp;#34;way yucky,&amp;#34; and hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since. That was over two weeks ago. I assume that she will probably relapse and we will have to reapply but, based on that experience I am confident that we have found a solution.</li>
            <li> I am a finger biting addict. I do it willingly and unwillingly. It is a habit that is very difficult to stop, I&#x27;m sure you know. This product tastes so bad that you will never bite your nails again. Trust me!</li>
            <li> I think it depends on how ready your child is to stop according to my experience with my son. If your child is ready and aware to fix it but needs some help, it works. If not, it doesn&#x27;t work at all to certain children. So DON&#x27;T GIVE UP, if it doesn&#x27;t work this time. IT MAY WORK NEXT TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many different ways to stop my son&#x27;s thumb sucking and nail biting since he was 2.5 years old. NOTHING WORKS including this. He never mentioned taste bad or anything, he kept sucking his thumb and biting nails as if nothing was on his nails. Every time I tried not only it failed but also it had a bad emotional side effect to my son, very cranky all the time. Now my son is in kindergarten, his nail biting gets worse and worse. He is well aware this habit is bad but it seems that&#x27;s very difficult for him to stop. I almost gave up since my last try six months ago, and even didn&#x27;t try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A REAL STORY STARTS HERE. A week ago, my husband put this on to his nails, ignoring my comment it would have not worked. But... IT WORKED THIS TIME. My child showed reactions, and said it&#x27;s taste very bad! Then, he started careful about putting his fingers to his mouth. It&#x27;s about one week now. First one or two days, my son didn&#x27;t want to eat, and threw up a little bit after the meal. Not sure what caused it, maybe the bad taste left in his mouth?</li>
            <li> We tried the &amp;#34;spicy nailpolish&amp;#34; and it just didn&#x27;t work for our thumb-sucker.  This stuff is potent and it really works.  Almost too well.  The polish will last for several days, and at first we had to help our little one learn to not even lick her finger when eating (culturally, we eat with our hands a lot).  However, it worked, and worked quickly.  She never got used to the flavor, and we are very happy that we didn&#x27;t even come close to using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this worked. My 3 year old son sucked his two first fingers CONSTANTLY. Every picture we have of him since he was a baby, that was what he was doing. He did it all night, seriously all the time. This product broke him of the habit almost immediately. He would stick his little fingers in his mouth, suck for a second, say  &amp;#34;mouth was stinky&amp;#34; and I think it was only a couple days that he even tried it again and he was done. I only had to apply it once! Worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This has helped my 7 year old stop sucking her thumb. It has staying power. Other products we tried she was able to suck it off (while crying) but this is so bad tasting she hasn&#x27;t tried to suck it off. Very thankful for the recommendation from our dentist.</li>
            <li> Product states that you will only need to apply it every 2 days. I applied it last night and less than 12 hours later it has already diminished. Seems that it will wash off after a few hand washes or a shower. Will probably be returning this to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this. Goes on clear, dries fast. Tested on myself and it&#x27;s very unpleasant tasting (should do the trick).</li>
            <li> My 3 year old suddenly took on the habit of biting his nails - frequently!  So we got this and put it on his nails to encourage him to stop. Well I can share this - he certainly doesn&#x27;t like the taste. The first time his fingernail went in his mouth resulted in a look on his face like he just took a bite of mom&#x27;sdreaded meatloaf and he quickly asked for his water. So it&#x27;s working but my only criticism is the strength of the taste seems to wear off quickly so just be prepared to apply it consistently every few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - for the record my wife makes a killer meatloaf!  :-)</li>
            <li> I am absolutely convinced that the manufacturer has changed the composition of this product.  I have been a habitual nail biter for 40 years.  I have tried everything, even taking it as far as wearing surgical gloves at home just to stop biting (I&#x27;m a stress biter).  I tried a lot of other things, including several liquids.  I purchased this product a few years ago and within 2 weeks, I stopped biting my nails.  I mean this in a good way, but it was the most disgusting taste ever and even made it hard to eat certain meals because of making contact with my mouth.  The greatest thing about it was that one coating would last at least 10 days and allowed me to completely kick the nail biting habit.  For the first time ever, I had nails and no desire to bite them anymore.  I was able to stop using the product all together and still maintain my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started biting again and remember getting this product so I ordered it right away.  While it tastes the same and immediately made me not want to put my fingers in my mouth, I couldn&#x27;t get it to last more than 3-4 days.  I am not doing anything differently in my lifestyle.  If anything, I probably spend less time with my hands in water since we have two kids now and use the dishwasher far more than handwashing.  I have to continuously apply this stuff every couple days or it is useless for me.  I can&#x27;t help but wonder if a change was made to cut costs or to intentionally force people to use up the product sooner so they would buy more.  Either way, it&#x27;s not the same product as far as I&#x27;m convinced and I can&#x27;t justify buying a bottle of this stuff every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a 3.5 year old thumb sucker.  I talked up how we were going to be getting something to help him quick thumb sucking and nail biting before we got it.  By the time it arrived, he insisted on using it.  I let him apply it himself (with my supervision, of course!).  It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s applied neatly or completely, just as long as there&#x27;s a little on each nail.  The first 2 days, he kept forgetting and putting his fingers in his mouth only to be surprised by the bad taste!  He rinsed his mouth and wiped his tongue with tissues to get it out!  It only took about a week for him to kick the habit, and right now we&#x27;re only using it occasionally as he &#x27;relapses&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, NASTY taste, EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> Been a nail biter my entire life. Used this stuff for 1 week and haven&#x27;t bit even once, stopped using it and haven&#x27;t bit for another week without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it works great ...BUT... know that you will get it in your mouth even if you don&#x27;t bite. You might rub your face, itch your mouth, rest your hand near your mouth, etc...it will happen and you will taste how bad this stuff is. Get a lot in your mouth and you&#x27;ll gag it&#x27;s so bad. Drinks don&#x27;t make it go away, it lasts for 15+ minutes easily if ANY gets in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s a good thing though, makes you VERY aware of where your hands go throughout the day and you quickly learn to keep hands off your face entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough if you bite nails or finger skin in any way.</li>
            <li> My son had a problem with finger biting. This stopped him, and changed the habit in less than one week. FABULOUS</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has been a thumb-sucker since he was an infant. This product just arrived in the mail today and I painted a little at the base of his thumb nail. I told him it was icky and even tried some myself. Yes, it&#x27;s icky and pretty potent. He put his thumb in his mouth and immediately was like a cat trying to hack up a hair ball. He was very unhappy and kept saying, &amp;#34;No! I don&#x27;t like it! I don&#x27;t like it!&amp;#34; He went down for his nap and is currently snoring - without his thumb in his mouth. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;(I would say, offer your child some water the first couple times they get it in their mouth. It&#x27;s just so nasty!!)</li>
            <li> I will pile on all the other reviews, this product is fantastic.  Simply put, it works.  We used this on our 4 year old daughter who is a thumbsucker. She sucks her thumb every night, all night and sometimes during the day as well.  I never imagined it would work so fast.  She stopped sucking her thumb after just one night of Mavala.  Now, I must warn, that one night  was pretty terrible.  She gagged, spit, and almost threw up when she put her thumb in her mouth.  I felt terrible for her, and if it would have gone on for nights on end, I would have stopped using the product, but it didn&#x27;t.  After just that one night, she has completely stopped sucking her thumb.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;d be driving, then suddenly have a bitter taste in my mouth.  I was nibbling while driving!  I was an occasional biter, and this really helped put an end to biting!  (..where is that taste coming from? LOL ..works!..)</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; dentist recommended this to help my daughter from sucking her thumb.  It took a couple of weeks (with one application a week), but it worked!</li>
            <li> This product worked remarkably well.  We tried other similar products from the local drugstore and they didn&#x27;t even dent our sons thumb-sucking habit.  We were very skeptical of this being any different.  However, we notice immediate results.  He hated the taste of it but it deterred Thumb-sucking from the first time we applied it.  This product essentially cured him of the habit within 7-10 days.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This rating is by my daughter who sucked her thumb for 8 years - i have tried many products none of them worked but this did. The taste is so bad it stays in your mouth for 5-10 min. it only took 3 days for me to stop. IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has a SEVERE case where he is sucking on his index fingers so severe that his fingers are blistered/callused and swollen, he&#x27;s even ripped into the skin, he&#x27;s been sucking on those fingers since birth and even in utero as a way to comfort himself. I&#x27;ve tried several products including THUM I read the reviews on the Mavala Stop and was impressed and anxious to try but it doesn&#x27;t work for my little guy, he seems to be ok with the taste (as dreadful as it is) Yuck! What has been successful is wrapping his little fingers in medical tape with cute little Band-Aids over that. LOL</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I bite my cuticles and it has broke me of the habit.  My husband bites his nails.  He no longer does.  !!!  Get product.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter has been \\&quot;thumb sucking free\\&quot; for seven days so far and I know this product is a major factor of why.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product on her thumb sucking nail seven days ago and then every other day since just to be sure the taste is still present just in case. I literally put one swipe of the liquid on her nail because I read a lot of reviews that said not to overdo the application on little ones.&lt;br /&gt;She tried to suck her thumb just once...&lt;br /&gt;She Pulled her thumb out of her mouth with a confused look on her face, looked at her thumb, sniffed it, and then put her hand on her lap. It was amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;It tastes very bitter. I just tried a small amount so I knew what I was giving her and that was more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel that anyone who is struggling with a child&#x27;s thumb sucking habit should give this a try.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This stuff REALLY worked. I used it for my 7 year old and my 9 year old. The 7 yr. sucked her two middle fingers in her sleep and the 9 yr. always bit her nails. They both have stopped--completely! The 9 yr. didn&#x27;t like the taste of the Mavala, it made her remember not to put her hands/nails in her mouth. The 7 yr. did not like the taste either, she stopped sucking her fingers in her sleep so she wouldn&#x27;t wake up with the nasty taste! This stuff is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I found that I need to apply this on the full surface of my son&#x27;s thumbnail on a daily basis for it to work. Not an issue.. but I found that the over conservative use by others to not be the same experience for my son. Also... and I don&#x27;t want to sound cruel... but it has been rather humorous to see my son&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note... that when you do this to a child (taking away their comfort/soothing habit) you might have a cranky child for a while.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8, and this is the one and only thing that had ever made a difference in her sucking her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;It took just under 3 weeks total. Hands down, this is the very best product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly highly recommend this if you are having the same issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My wife also used it for two weeks and it completely stopped her issues with chewing her nails. Awesome!</li>
            <li> It does everything it promises to.  I tried everything else to no avail, but this instantly took care of the thumbsucking problem.  Tip:  Use it only at the base of the thumbnail because it can interfere with eating.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s nails were really bitten back.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and the results are encouraging.  I&#x27;m hoping for complete success.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get too long winded on this one. I now have a 4 year old who doesn&#x27;t suck his finger anymore after only a couple of weeks on Mavala - bam, done. I&#x27;m really happy I bought this product. Also yes, it really does taste nasty.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ONLY WORKS ON CHILDREN ABOVE AGE 3, SINCE TASTE BUD FOR BITTERNESS DOESN&#x27;T DEVELOP TIL AGE 3.  I USE THIS PRODUCT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THUMBSTER.  ONE OF MY SON HAD RELAPSED A FEW TIMES FROM THUMB SUCKING, AND USING BOTH PRODUCT REALLY HELP HIM QUITE.</li>
            <li> My 4-year son stopped sucking his thumb after 3rd time using this product. Have been trying many ways to let him quit ... So happy!</li>
            <li> It worked in the beginning, but my son got used to the taste and is back to biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I used this at an earlier age than recommended...18 months...  Worked as advertised, but let me warn you...you only need a tiny bit as other reviewers stated (at least with the young ones...)  My daughter gagged and had a tough time recovering when she put her thumb in the first time.  After that, you could see she was dying to suck her thumb, but she would look at me and say &amp;#34;no, no, no&amp;#34;.  After 1 week, no desire for it at all...  and she had sucked non stop since about 2 months.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that helped my 10 year old to stop sucking her thumb!  Everything else we tried just washed off easily.  Mavala stays on the nail and can even be used on the skin so it really helps remind them to keep their fingers out of their mouth.  Highly recommend Mavala!</li>
            <li> My son and 2 of his fingers were inseparable since he was born 5 years ago. We tried anything from bribing to talking to no avail. After doing some research I found this product which is safe for kids. It did wonders for mine, as soon as that stuff was on his nails, no more fingers in his mouth! After only a week he kicked the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for all the finger suckers and nail biters!</li>
            <li> So, the product arrived via UPS literally 8 hours ago. My girlfriend helped me apply a single-layer coating to my fingernails soon after I came home from work. All I have to say is...well...I&#x27;ve vomited three times since then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally this would be considered a bad feature of a product, but in the case of Mayala STOP, I believe this effect was intended. Now only if the 3oz bottle came with an ample supply of ammonia and a new shirt ;)</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I was a bit wary of putting something on my child&#x27;s thumb that might make her throw up. However, I went ahead and bought it, had a little chat with my 4 year old about what was going to happen if she put her thumb in her mouth and she stopped cold turkey. We&#x27;re not even applying it after two weeks.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried other no bite things to get my daughter to quit sucking her thumb.  I had heard great things about this product; however, I didn&#x27;t feel it did any better than the other products that I only paid about $3.50 for. ( I paid over $12 for this bottle.)</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old stopped sucking her thumb! It took two applications. The first time she just sucked it anyway, so I reapplied a few days later and voila! Habit broken.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get my 4 year old to stop biting including offering nail polish for not biting and my daughter could not stop.  It&#x27;s tough to get this on when she sleeps every other night, but that is what seems to work.  She told me her fingers taste yucky and I can see her nails are getting longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY tastes bad!  I know, because I tried it before putting it on my daughters fingers.  It has a bitter taste.  One application of it and it cracked my daughter&#x27;s nail biting habit in a snap!</li>
            <li> Simply I have to say that this product is GREAT! my daughter stopped sucking his thumb in minutes! I love it  love  it love it love it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simplemente tengo que decir que este producto es GENIAL !!! mi hija dejo de chuparse el dedo en cuestion de minutos !!  me encanta me encanta me encanta !!!</li>
            <li> this is just what I needed. My son thinks its horrible. Im sure it will get him to stop biting his nails and fingers in no time at all. It is gross tasting.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about getting any of this stuff you need to rethink it. Does it work....yes....BUT i wouldnt use it if i were you and here is why. I bought Mavala Stop of my little girl to try to help her stop sucking her finger. I had it sitting on the table in my living room and since the bottle looked like finger nail polish she desided to open it nad try to put it on. In the process of this she spilled it on the table. It wasnt on there very long...Less that 1 min.. and when it was wiped up i noticed that it ate the finish off of the table. Now my question is this... if it can eat the finish off of a table what is it doing to your teeth and stomach?? not to mention you skin where you put it on.. I do not see where this stuff is safe and will not use it and i do not reccomend anyone else use it either</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old to help her stop sucking her thumb. She likes that it goes on like nail polish. I even tried some on my thumb too...boy that stuff tastes really bitter! We have been using it for about a week now. I asked my daughter if she wanted to suck her thumb anymore and she said, &amp;#34;nu-uh mommy, it&#x27;s yucky!&amp;#34; We do have to keep applying it every 2 days so it stays yucky. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old was a mild fingernail and severe toe nail bitter. She would make her toes bleed. She had bitten her big toe nails about half off! Gross and medically unsafe. Her Doctors only suggestion was to distract her, which didn&#x27;t work, and applying Crisco to her nails. Also didn&#x27;t work and made the house greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the over the counter nail biting remedy called Thumb. It had a slight hot pepper taste to it. My daughter liked it! Plus after one lick the taste was gone and she soon realized this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased Mavala Stop. What a big difference! It has a very bitter taste to it. The instructions say a child under the age of three may not have full taste buds and the product may not work due to the fact that they may not be able to taste the bitterness.  However, it worked for my daughter! She does not like the taste. The taste actually stays on the nails even after hand washing!  The directions say to reapply every two days.  I would forget to reapply  because she was not biting her nails.  If I would remember to reapply I know her habit would be totally gone by now. I would  DEFIANTLY suggest this to anyone with a nail biting problem.  Just remember to reapply as needed.  My daughters nails are actually starting to grow back! I have suggested this product to my daughters Doctor!</li>
            <li> During stressful times, I bite off all my nails.  Once they&#x27;re bitten off - it&#x27;s hard for me to quit biting them so I thought I&#x27;d try this product.  Well, it&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m not biting them anymore.  The taste if you do is just bitter enough to make you stop.  And my nails already look better after a week.  I highly recommend this product.  One warning though, if you eat anything with your fingers... be careful or you might taste bitter with it!!  :)</li>
            <li> VERY bitter. Keeps me from biting my nails on a regular basis. I will say that eating finger foods is a challenge and I definitely reccommend using a fork for those if you want to avoid the bitter taste. It serves its purpose and will help you kick that nasty habit once and for all!</li>
            <li> My 6yr old would bite his fingernails down to the point where they would bleed a bit. As soon as I applied this it worked immediately! He no longer bites his nails. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the Amazon recommendations.  I had tried everything to stop biting my nails.  I started biting my nails to the quick at a very young age.  I had done so up until two months ago when I started using this product.  I feel like I am completely cured.  I no longer put my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  With other products I could get past the taste and still bite my nails.  With this product, I could not do that.  It was just what I needed.  The best feeling in the world was cutting my nails with nail clippers.  I would recommend this product a 100-times over if you have tried everything else and nothing has worked.  I bought two bottles just to be sure.  The first bottle has lasted over 2 months and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it yet.  All you need is a light coating of the product on your nails to keep your nails away from your mouth.  Also, for the men trying to stop biting, this product isn&#x27;t overly shiny, so you won&#x27;t get strange looks from people that think that you polish your nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago for my 3 year old daughter who sucks her two middle fingers.  Besides the fact that it&#x27;s a gross and unhealthy habit, her fingers were starting to peel and crack and daycare wasn&#x27;t helping much... only washing her hands evertime they caught her... they asked me to bring a paci for her - ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!  So, I bought this to break the habit mostly at night, but we put it on twice a day... after day 1, she told me how \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; it was and since then we&#x27;ve not caught her with her fingers... I sneak into her bedroom and she&#x27;s not sucking on them.  Her hands look better and her nails are beginning to grow.  Her teachers at school mentioned she&#x27;s not sucking her fingers.  We bought another product prior to this one... \\&quot;Thum\\&quot; brand I got at target from the pharmacy... it didn&#x27;t even slow her down... this Mavala is by far superior!!!  Since it worked well on her, we put it on my 4 year old son who was biting his nails... and it worked on him, too! GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my son. He started sucking his thumb at age 2 1/2 all the time. Bought this hoping to stop him and he would just suck right through it. The first few times he said it was yucky but after that, it didn&#x27;t phase him.</li>
            <li> This would probably work better than all other brands, but the solution is just super strong and bitter.  The taste gets into food all day long, and my 10 year old son simply refuses to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to prevent myself from getting sick from accidentally biting my nails. I didn&#x27;t think this would work well since I figured I would just get used to the taste but I was wrong. The taste actually makes me cringe even when I accidentally bring my fingers to my lips. Its taste is something you would never get used to. Classical conditioning working its miracles...</li>
            <li> I bought this product for both my 5-year-old daughter who constantly sucked her thumb and bit her nails and my husband who has been biting his nails since the beginning of time. My husband has not had any interest in stopping himself but agreed to put it on with my daughter for moral support. My daughter had expressed that she wanted to stop sucking her thumb but didn&#x27;t know how, presumably because she was getting embarrassed to do so in front of her classmates. They put it on together and my daughter has not sucked her thumb since the first application! As for the nail biting, they will both start again if I&#x27;m not re-applying every 2 days diligently. Even when that happens though, my daughter will bite but does not suck her thumb!&lt;br /&gt;As for the taste, my husband was initially hesitant that this would work, since he supposedly ate through a whole bunch of bad tasting nail polish as a child. After using this he praises this product to everyone as being the worst tasting nail polish he has ever used and that IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Our problem was not thumb-sucking, but simply putting fingers in the mouth a lot. The Mavala was fantastic. We only used it for two days and problem solved. All the warnings about the taste on the fingers affecting eating were right, though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> After 50 years I decided to use this to help me stop biting my nails.  It works! The bad part is.......the bitter taste will transfer to the foods you are making and ruin the taste.  I suggest you were gloves if you need to prepare meals.  I know your family will appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop for my 3 year old daughter who sucks her thumb, constantly.  She put her thumb in her mouth after the first application, and immediately began to gag.  After gagging for a few seconds, she bagan to vomit!  She must have vommited 4 times that first day.  But, she did quit sucking her thumb for 2 STRAIGHT days, which was a miricle in itself.  I guess the taste has wore off though, because she&#x27;s sucking her thumb again.  I want to put this stuff back on her thumb, but her daddy says no.  I guess we&#x27;ll see?!  I tried it my self, to see what the big deal was, and this stuff is horrible!  It taste like a mix of nail polish and asprin!  And once it hits your tounge, it spreads over your whole mouth!  So, I believe this stuff is great, if you don&#x27;t have a week stomach, or a bad gag reflex!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This product definitely will stop you from putting your fingers in you mouth. Problem is that this product rubs off on everything, particularly if you are eating with your hands, like a sandwich, the bitterness rubs off in your food and mouth and lingers for a long long time.  Or if you simply touch your mouth, you will be Assalted by bitterness. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so bitter, it&#x27;s really harsh.</li>
            <li> I will admit when the dentist told me about this product I wasn&#x27;t so sure that it worked.  My daughter has sucked her thumb ever since birth and she is now a 7 year old.  We have tried alot of different ways to get her to stop sucking her thumb and nothing has worked.  So we followed the advice of the dentist and ordered the product.  Upon its arrival we used in on her thumb and surpisingly IT WORKED!!  She did put her thumb in her mouth one morning as she was still laying in the bed but she was quickly reminded from the taste of it that she wasn&#x27;t supposed to have her thumb in her mouth.  She got up gagging and wanting water to drink.  We only applied this product a few times and it has been 2 months and we haven&#x27;t seen her with her thumb in her mouth - not even at night when we go in to check on her.  So if you are having doubts - don&#x27;t.  Go ahead and place your order - this stuff really WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Tried this on my four year old (and myself).  Mixed results with her...after two days she figured out how to \\&quot;wash off\\&quot; the taste via handwashing, nosepicking, etc.  I think her ingenuity shouldn&#x27;t affect the rating.  For me, it worked great.  Very bitter taste.  I would note that you should be careful when eating food with your hands (e.g., sandwiches, etc.) as you WILL taste this stuff.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything with my almost 6 year old to stop her from sucking her thumb.  This did the job in a couple of days.  We kept it on for a month just in case but have never had a relapse.</li>
            <li> I was a fingernail biter for over 30 years. This is the stuff that finally broke the habit! It tastes NAAAAASTY!! (Which is the point!)  It is a taste that will linger in your mouth for a little while if you accidentally put your fingers in your mouth. Be very careful to only brush it on the tops of the nails. If it gets on your fingertips and then you eat finger foods, you will taste it!! It takes several hand washings to wear off, so you don&#x27;t have to apply it after every visit to the restroom. I would recommend put it on at least daily, though, so the taste stays potent enough to ward off bad habits. I&#x27;m currently using this on my youngest son because he still sucks on his fingers. He does try to wash it off, so I have to be really good about remembering to apply it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this stuff with my three year old toddler,and I&#x27;ve tried other stuff,and the other stuff does not work.The Mavala Stop polish is more expensive than other things,but like I said before,it works.Don&#x27;t ever miss and get any on your fingers though,because the stuff will leave you with the worst taste in your mouth.I wish that it was ok to put on every day instead of every other day though, because my child sucks his thumb every other day now.But,it&#x27;s better than him sucking his thumb and making all those loud annoying suckling noises all day everyday. Also,we parents must help them to stop while they are young before they ruin their teeth to the point to where they can not be fixed.Even braces don&#x27;t fix everything,and no one wants to spend so much money on braces.I only gave it 4 out 5 stars because they don&#x27;t list any of the ingredients on the bottle.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that my daughter no longer sucks her thumb. I would put it on weekly, but have noticed that she no longer has the desire to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> This is an OK product, it does its job but not well. The only problem this has is the fact that it gets transferred to things too easily, especially water! If you wash your face with this on your nails its going to come off on your face and you wont realise it until you lick your lips and realise the horrid bitter taste is somewhere its not suppose to be. If that is fixed this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 18 months old and she is a thumbsucker.  I tried all possible ways to stop her from sucking her thumb.  I tried Neem oil, bandaids, clove oil, soapnut extract and what not.  When nothing turned out to be a success, I found this product and bought it immediately.  Following the reviews by the other people on this product,  I decided to start using this product on her over a weekend so that I can handle the mishaps.  As others mentioned she gave me a real tough time for 2 days.  But let me tell u this product works wonders.  I could get my daughter to completely weane her thumbsucking and I am very happy that her gum/teeth line will no longer get effected because of this habit.  Trust me ! this product works !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first day. Every time my 2 yr old tried to suck her thumb we&#x27;d hear little gagging noises, and after an hour she stopped trying. Day two she has decided the taste is funny and she sucks if off while giggling. The packaging does say that it is not for use on kids under 3 as their taste buds are not fully developed.</li>
            <li> This product was a life saver! We could not get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb for anything and this little gem worked!! In two weeks time she completely stopped!!! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I put it on my child&#x27;s thumb and fingers and it broke him of the habit. You must remain vigilant and keep reapplying as the thumb sucking will sneak back up and the kids will default to other available fingers.  All digits must be painted. I also put it on to show solidarity -- and because I was also biting my own -- and let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t want to put the lingering bitter tasting stuff on my fingers ever again. Effective.</li>
            <li> This works lightening fast!  Only had to use it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beware, unlike the old &#x27;thumb&#x27; that was more like seasoning, this stuff is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another parent said to watch for regurgitation on first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for a rough first time with the loss of the &#x27;pacifier&#x27; and potential gastric discomfort....but hopefully it will be your last as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to sleep without the self soothing crutch took a couple days to iron out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now after a few days, we are thumb free AND falling asleep well again.</li>
            <li> I am 52 year old man. I have been biting my nails for many years. I bought this product,and am glad I did. Every time I put my fingers to my mouth,I would get the nasty taste.It would remind me not to bite.In a couple weeks I had nails.I will use the product for a while,in case I start to bite,without relizing it. It was $10 dollars well spent!!!</li>
            <li> Mavala® Stop (0.3 oz)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My foster son has a 3 1/2 year old habit of sucking his fingers to the point of damaging his teeth. This product did nothing  to discourage this habit. But neither did a competing product from Walgreens.  I guess this might work on someone with less of an ingrained habit.</li>
            <li> Part of sucsessfully breaking the Thumb Sucking habit is that your child has to WANT to stop. My child wasn&#x27;t quite ready to stop but we bought the product anyway. For 2 weeks before I used the product, every time I saw her thumb in her mouth, I would tell her \\&quot;When you start Kindergarten the other kids will tease you about sucking your thumb. Are you ready to stop?\\&quot; She kept telling me \\&quot;Not yet dad\\&quot;. Finally one day out of frustration my wife put the Mavala Stop on all of her fingernails. The result was amazing!! The first time her thumb went in her mouth she pulled it out immediately \\&quot;This nail polish tastes GROSS Mom!!\\&quot; To which my wife replied \\&quot;are you ready to stop sucking your thumb now?\\&quot; and that was pretty much it. we only applied the product about 3 times. Once the first week and twice the next week. The product worked great for us.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for our almost 4-year-old son who had adopted the nasty habit of putting his fingers in his mouth. What is it with preschool-aged children putting their hands in their mouths anyways? We ordered it on the advice of a sister-in-law who had the same problem with her son. The first time the Mavala was put on all of his fingers, our son was aware that it would taste bad. He didn&#x27;t like it. I think having some yucky tasting stuff on his fingers gave him conscious effort to keep his hands out of his mouth. That being said, while I believe the product can work wonders for many, it did not accomplish the mission as fast as I wanted. I&#x27;m half convinced that our son just has to outgrow this stage. I may try it on his hands again in the future.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Stopped my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s 20 year nail baiting habit. A word of advice though... if he/she/you will be touching any type of food while cooking or eating, make sure to wear gloves!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect. It definitely works and would recommended to anyone with nail bitting habits. I used it on my son and he is no longer sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> This stops thumbsucking.  I catch my 9 year old every now and then sucking her thumb at night.  It tastes awful, so it does the job of breaking the habit.  It stays on for days.  The only downside is that she doesn&#x27;t want to eat finger find in case she accidentally gets her thumb near her food.  Otherwise, a great problem for a pesky problem.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I remember. I wanted to stop so I purchased this back in December. I did have to apply it every couple of days but after 2 weeks...I don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this stuff is so powerful that you can&#x27;t really eat small things with your hands without making your food taste terrible. On the other hand, it is also a good way to curb that Cheetos habit ;)</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker. At his orthodontist consult we were told of this product. Glad we tried it. Stopped his habit quick.</li>
            <li> for sure it works, i don&#x27;t bite as long as i have it on. I wish it lasted a little bit longer. I have to put a new layer every 2 days. Whenever i forget i bite again. It will take couple more months to get rid off this bad habit</li>
            <li> broke my son of his thumb sucking habit. I accidently got some on my finger and this stuff is nasty. definitely wont stick your fingers in your mouth after this experiance</li>
            <li> We tried everything with my daughter: pennies when she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb, a glove that covered her thumb, and a different brand of bad tasting nail polish.  None of it worked.  In two nights, Mavala broke her of the thumb sucking.  It&#x27;s miraculous stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my fingernails for my entire life, and bought this to stop. It worked almost instantly, and within a week I had creepy regular length fingernails. It does make your fingernails a bit shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes a little bit like the exhaust from a car&#x27;s tailpipe and a dirty sock. I ate a highland toffee and tried to pick the gooey bits out of my teeth with my finger. Big mistake. All in all, does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for probably over 15 years now and this is the first nail product I have purchased that actually works. I&#x27;ve tried all other products and tricks and have had no luck. The pepper flavored products didn&#x27;t even stop me from chewing on my nails. This one instantly did. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I literally have stopped biting my nail. Actually I can&#x27;t get my fingers even near my mouth because the product tastes so bad. The taste is incredibly bitter and literally almost makes you gag. The good thing with the taste is now I avoid getting my fingers near my mouth and no more biting. The taste does disappear after a couple days, but I just put another coat. It&#x27;s pretty common for polish to disappear from the nails after a couple days, so I expected the same with this. This product really is a miracle worker for me right now. If you bite your nails I highly suggest you try the product because the taste is so bad you&#x27;ll avoid your hands near your mouth.</li>
            <li> At first it work but eventually my three year old built up a resistance to this product and it didn&#x27;t stop his finger sucking at all. After a year of frustration we bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHVMP8/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 recently and so far it&#x27;s been great...I wish I would have paid for the glove a long time ago. I&#x27;d suggest the nail polish if your child doesn&#x27;t have a really strong habit but if they are addicted to their fingers like mine is it might not help unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old who have both been thumb suckers since they were in utero.  They would mostly suck their thumbs at night when they had their blankets.  My husband and I had tried EVERYTHING to get them to stop sucking.  Nothing worked.  They were even sucking in their sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took my 5 year old to the dentist for his biannual cleaning and she told us that, due to the thumb sucking, he&#x27;s moved his soft palate so much that he won&#x27;t have room in his mouth for his teeth.  She was going to recommend going to an orthodontist for a palate extender after he turned 6.  I decided enough was enough and opted for Mavala® Stop.  The other similar products didn&#x27;t have as good reviews and some even stated they discolored the finger nail.  So, I hopped on Amazon and bought the product.  I left it up to my husband to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala® Stop is a miracle worker.  My 5 year old was old enough to understand the importance of stopping and he just needed that little push.  We continue to apply it every 2 days (it wears off) because we don&#x27;t want him to accidentally suck in his sleep but it&#x27;s worked like a charm.  We also applied it to the 3 year old but she just switched thumbs that she sucks so she&#x27;s not quite ready.  We are going to prepare her and talk to her about it while still applying it to only one thumb for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, for kids, if they are old enough to understand why you are putting the polish on and the importance of stopping it&#x27;s a wonderful product (with a HORRIBLE taste) to break bad habits.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were skeptical that this would get our 3-year-old to stop sucking his thumb.  His front teeth actually started to move because of him sucking it and the dentist suggested Mavala.  We told our son that if he kept sucking his thumb it would start to taste bad. I put it on, and my son said \\&quot;my thumb tastes yucky mamma\\&quot;.  That was all it took.  I applied it one more time just to make sure and my son has not sucked his thumb since!  I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that was able to stop my son from sucking his thumb. I tried other products but this won hands down.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 and has been sucking her fingers since birth. We tried putting a glove on her hand and also using duct tape on her fingers. This would work temporarily but she would eventually suck on the glove or start sucking other fingers. I put this product on her once and she has stopped sucking her fingers all together. I agree with the other comments that the bitterness is intense! It will get on their lips and will also get on finger foods. The product does not wash off easily which makes it very effective! After the first application, I put more on after 3 days. With subsequent applications, I didn&#x27;t put as much on her. I would not put this on very oung children. The box says 3 years or older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well. In fact, I am using it now. I have been a nail biter for over 40 years. As of now, I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write a review... but this one I had to.  This product is absolutely amazing!!!! I have 3 daughters, all hard core thumb suckers.  The oldest being 8 and the twins being 6.  I tried EVERYTHING to get them to stop sucking there thumbs and was completely loosing hope, when their new dentist recommended this product to me.  The first time I used it.. all 3 girls cried because the taste was so bad... but by the next day they were all willing, so the processes began.  We applied it to their thumbs once a day for 3 weeks.  Now one month later I have 3 daughters that are NOT thumb suckers!!!! I am so excited about this product.. if you have a thumb sucker you have to try this!</li>
            <li> Bought for our 3 year old son, but he can suck off the bitter taste, but it works for hubby who has a nail-biting habit.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, and the flavor will linger in your mouth for a long time if you are not careful. But, I guess that is the point. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in months thanks to this.</li>
            <li> Tried everything else on our 4 year old and this finally worked.  Tried just about everything else.  Glad I didnt have to buy those 80$ thumb covers.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has been sucking her thumb since birth. This is the only thing that worked, and we tried numerous gadgets and remedies. It only took one coat.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on our two year old!  She didn&#x27;t like it but continued to suck her thumb anyway.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter started sucking her finger at 4month. I&#x27;ve tried everything possible to stop her. I then discovered MAVALA and used it on her at age 2+ and it really didnt work, 2 days later she would put her  thumb back in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a break and said maybe when she gets older i will try the product again. She is 4 years now and mavala has her stop sucking her fingers. She calls it her &amp;#34;princess nail polish&amp;#34;... Trust me its a miracle to me .I&#x27;m so glad she is not sucking her thumb anymore as it use to be so annoying when she sleeps...So Happy for mavala and i recommend this product to everyone. Just keep on trying..</li>
            <li> Both of my kids, 8 and 5, have been sucking their thumb and/or fingers since birth. One application for each stopped this practice cold.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would give 5 stars to something that tastes so nasty, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person&#x27;s hands can be. Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again. It&#x27;s such a gross habit, and I knew I had to quit again. But I just couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In stepped Mavala. It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don&#x27;t accidentally get any in my mouth. You do get *slightly* used to the taste, but not enough to allow you to want to purposefully put your fingers in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works on pets, too! lol. My brother&#x27;s dogs kept chewing on a corner of a hammock stand. I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Stopped son&#x27;s thumb sucking in only three applications. Have a camera to record the funny faces and bottle of water.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a person with a very strong thumb addiction but but it didnt seem to stop his habit. i tasted it it does taste horrible and would probably work for most people. but i guess his addiction was just too strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it was cheaper than restrictive thumb guards and also because he could wear it at school without bringing attention to himself. Originally I applied it as directed but it failed to work so I increased it to once a day from once every two days. Then when that didn&#x27;t work I started applying it twice a day. In the morning before school and after school also. I continued to catch him sucking his thumb 3-5 times a day and he admits to sucking his thumb at school during nap time. It does taste bad but his desire to suck his thumb is greater than his desire not to taste the Mavala Stop product. I&#x27;m obviously disappointed and looking into other options.</li>
            <li> Maybe my child just doesn&#x27;t mind bad tasting stuff.  I tasted this myself and it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I would keep my fingers out of my mouth if I was a kid.  She still bit her nails even with this on.</li>
            <li> My son had a major pacifier habit. When he was about 3, we finally managed to get it away from him (although he protested greatly). We thought he was finally cured but then he noticed his baby sister sucking her thumb and decided to try it. He was instantly hooked and we gave up. During his most recent dentist visit, the dentist told him he needed to stop sucking his thumb because he is pushing his teeth out of alignment. Then, a week later, the pediatrician told him the same thing. She told us that she used Mavala on her own daughter when her daughter wanted to stop sucking her thumb. My son was intrigued and asked me to get some for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I put it on him, I made sure he was still okay with it. He was anxious to stop sucking his thumb, so we went ahead. It dries very fast and barely has any gloss to it. I was afraid it would look like clear nail polish but it is much more matte and difficult to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy oh boy, is this stuff effective. He put his thumb in his mouth automatically when I tucked him in and immediately took it right out again. He laughed about how gross it was but also asked for water to get the taste out of his mouth. I reapplied it every two days as per the instructions. I applied it 3 times and he has not sucked his thumb for about a month now. He was getting embarrassed about sucking his thumb now that he is in kindergarten and is so proud to have stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumb sucking is such an ingrained comforting habit, that you need something hardcore like this to change the way your gut reacts to the thought of putting your thumb in your mouth. I think it works better if the child really wants to stop too.</li>
            <li> I used it on my four year old daughter&#x27;s thumb one time and she stopped sucking her thumb. Truly amazing because I thought she would never stop.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing! My now 7 year old daughter has sucked her thumb since she was 1. When she turned 5 we decided it was time for her to stop because we notice that she was getting an overbite. We tried other methods to get her to stop. We tried everything for almost 2 years without success. She went to her dentist for a checkup and he suggested mavala. I was sceptical so it wasn&#x27;t until almost a year later that I finally ordered mavala stop online. My daughter was reluctant to let me put it on her thumb at first then I told her I would put it on my thumb too. That was the only time I had to put it on her thumb, it worked the 1st day. And let me tell you it is the worst tasting stuff, the taste lingers for a long time. But it really works! I already notice a difference in my daughters overbite.</li>
            <li> We bought this to break our 2 year old of sucking her thumb.  It had no effect.  I don&#x27;t think their taste buds are developed enough for this to work.  I tried it myself and BLECH wow it&#x27;s terrible (which is a good thing).  We&#x27;ll save it for any issues down the road.</li>
            <li> It is helping my child. The only regret is when my child washes their hands because it comes off&lt;br /&gt;but other than that it really works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Tricia</li>
            <li> The bitter taste will definitely deter you from chewing on your fingernails, but I wish the flavor did not rub off onto food so easily. If you eat a sandwich or other finger food, you will taste the bitterness. You need to re-apply every other day to maintain effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My son sucks his thumb until the skin is raw. My wife thinks I am mean for putting this on his thumb. He spends 75% of his day with his thumb in his mouth. I have tried wrapping athletic tape on his thumb and it worked ok but he would pull it off when he went to bed or he would suck it any way. The thum product works for about an hour but he would just suck it off. Now this stuff works great I even tasted it and I really regretted. He doesn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth any more. He is on day four and it has been going really well.</li>
            <li> Used it on my 22 month old - after one night&#x27;s application he has not sucked his thumb for the past 2 weeks!  I used it very sparingly as well, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how safe it would be for him (not sure what the chemical is that makes it so bitter).  We still have the entire bottle for relapses, I&#x27;m going to try it to cure my older son&#x27;s nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> smells bad but works lol&lt;br /&gt;son already doesnt suck his thumb so much but i wonder about health ? l</li>
            <li> I choose this product because it was cheaper and easier than several other versions I was looking at.  I had to to talk my wife into into it, but when she agreed it worked within three days!!!  My daughter now does not suck her thumb at all, not even accidentally or at night.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone else.</li>
            <li> This was my last-ditch effort to get my three year-old to stop sucking her thumb.  I heavily debated whether I was ready to put her through this, but all the nagging and attempted bribes and reminders were getting old.  I figured the longer I let her do it, the worse off she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they should make this stuff in tiny sample sizes, because it only took one initial application of a single coat and one single-coat reapplication after 2 days and it&#x27;s now been over two weeks of no thumb-sucking.  I only saw her try to put her thumb in her mouth twice during the first day and once on day 2 (right before I reapplied) and that&#x27;s it.  Despite her numerous efforts to lose the taste by washing her hands on day one, she gave up without much of a fight.  Surprisingly, that instinct I assumed she had that drew her thumb into her mouth ceased with a quickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many have already stated, go easy on this stuff and keep an eye on your kid while eating/drinking.  My daughter was eating a sandwich and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why she looked so offended by the taste and started spitting it out.  We figured out the problem and made sure she ate with her other hand for the first few days to avoid accidental tastings of the Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my only other complaint is that I&#x27;m now stuck with a basically full bottle of this stuff and it was pretty pricey.  I suppose it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than braces, though!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old wanted to stop her bad habit of chewing her nails, so I found Mavala.  It is applied as a clear nail polish over the nails.  It is so effective that it makes her gag when she gets it in her mouth. The trouble is that when she tries to eat &#x27;finger foods&#x27;, the awful taste ruins the meal for her.  She&#x27;s given up trying to use this on her nails, but we&#x27;ve found an even better use for this product: RABBIT CHEWING DETERRENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our spoiled little Holland Lop rabbit loved to chew on our electrical cords and it was difficult keeping her away from them when we open her cage several hours a day for her to exercise and spend time with our family.  One day a light popped on in my head and I remembered how the Mavala product would prevent my daughter from chewing her nails.  We &#x27;painted&#x27; the Mavala up and down the electrical cords and Voila!  No more destroyed cords!  No more fear of our sweet little bunny getting electrocuted!  She comes up to the cords, sniffs them and turns away.  Thank you Mavala!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend bites her nails and wants to stop so i got this for her...works so well she wont wear it hahaha</li>
            <li> This product only took one application to cure my three year-old from sucking her thumb.  She had been an avid thumb sucker since she was in the womb.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids (ages 4 &amp; 5 respectively) have little habits that are less than desired: one thumb sucks, the other is a nail and toenail biter.  Bribery, punishment, and begging pleading and whining did nothing.  Deciding that I was fighting one majorly losing battle, I decided it was time to call in the reinforcements...I bought a bottle of Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the advice of other reviewers, I put on a small amount on the tips of my kid&#x27;s fingers and thumbs only.  That small amount was more than enough to cause my kids to look at their fingers in confusion and go &amp;#34;blech&amp;#34;. It was hard to not laugh at my daughter&#x27;s perplexed look when she started sucking her thumb then confused tongue/lip smacking after a few seconds of sucking.  We&#x27;d get her to rinse out her mouth then let her carry on.  On the first night we applied it (right before bedtime and during storytime), she ended up going to sleep without sucking her thumb.  I noticed that she didn&#x27;t bother sucking her thumb all of the next day either.  SUCCESS!  And all without a fight.  Noticed the son isn&#x27;t biting his nail either...I&#x27;ll probably keep reapplying every few days while he&#x27;s asleep to ensure those nails get ample time to grow out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Almost wish they&#x27;d make a smaller than 0.3 oz size since this product does it&#x27;s job after the first application especially for thumb sucking. We&#x27;ve used this on our daughter who stopped sucking her thumb after the first application and on my niece (a very prolific thumb sucker) who stopped after 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve now used this again to stop our, now, older daughter&#x27;s nail biting habit with just a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product to any parent with children that either suck their thumb or for people with nail biting issues.</li>
            <li> But i think that is the point.  My son quit chewing his nails within three applications.  However, he did want to taste my pink nail polish to see if it tasted better.</li>
            <li> Seems to work initially but now my 4 yr old kid has gotten used to the taste and now sucks it off. Any advice?</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucked her thumb almost since birth, and my 9 year old has been biting her fingernails since she was about 3 were able to kick their habits in one day of using Mavala Stop.  I have continued to use it as often as I can remember(usually once every other day) just to make sure the habit doesn&#x27;t reappear.  I have tried other bad tasting polishes with no success.  My children said Mavale has the most horrible taste EVER... as long as it&#x27;s memorable and it works, that&#x27;s what counts!</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product, if it were for me, it would definatley work, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t phase my son. I think he&#x27;s just an oddball, bc the stuff tastes nasty. I would reccommend it for thumb sucking even though it doesn&#x27;t work for my son, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> So Far the product was recommended by her dentist to stop my daughter from sucking her fingers and so far it is working, so satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is like no other! I&#x27;ve tried so many others and have paid a lot more money for something I was told would help my child stop sucking her fingers. Needles to say to no avail. This product not only was it inexpensive, but it works!! Use it as it says and your child will stop sucking or bitting their nails. This products is so bitter, and lingers in their mouth too that they will not want to put their hands anywhere near their mouth!! Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I actually stopped biting my nails within a few days. I&#x27;ve been bitting my nails for the past 24 years. THIS PRODUCT WORKS. I would recommend it to all nail bitters. The taste is god awful and was makes it worse is that even if you touch your face or lips with this product on it will make you stop.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter sucked her thumb anyway.  Although, she did seem to quit several weeks later eventually.  So it may have really worked afterall.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I applied too much, and had to eat all my food with knife and fork for the first 2 days.  Beyond that, it totally worked! I was immediately able to stop biting my nails after biting nonstop for my whole life (28 years).</li>
            <li> We love this product and are excited to use it with my daughter who bites her nails. We used this with my son when he was 3 yrs old to stop him from sucking his thumb. We only had to use it 1 time and that was all it took for him to stop. It work very well.</li>
