            <li>I have two boys, 4 and 5 and these work wonderfully.</li>

            <li>The do smell good and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was good, too.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>It still was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product and my kids like flossing their teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Establishing excellent dental care habits is important in a child&#x27;s life, so get these as soon as the child sprouts a tooth.</li>
            <li>Kids love these flossers!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use, and have a great shaped handle for the kids to hold.</li>
            <li>I tried one on my own teeth and agreed.</li>
            <li>She is now 11 and has been using these since she started flossing her own teeth...</li>
            <li>I use the flossers if they&#x27;re handy when I happen to need to floss.</li>
            <li>Honestly have not tried them in my own mouth yet.</li>
            <li>Helps her floss effectively.</li>
            <li>Each set of 75 comes in its own convenient resealable pack</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good value</li>
            <li>It shreds very easily as well.</li>
            <li>This is more of a trip to the dentist office kind of flavor.  </li>
            <li>These are fun taste great and make flossing easier.</li>
            <li>He loves the bright colors and flossing is quick and painless.</li>
            <li>The kids can use this on their own easily, then we follow to make sure our tots are doing a food job.</li>
            <li>Kids love picking colors.</li>
            <li>I bought them specifically because I thought they were, and knew the kids would love them.</li>
            <li>My son loves these more than the minty ones.  </li>
            <li>The grip is OK, but I almost always end up using two or more to floss as one</li>
            <li>I kept wondering whether it&#x27;s safe to floss my kids&#x27; teeth with it.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for smaller hands...easy to grip and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>I was attracted to the cute packaging at the store, so I bought some to enourage flossing with the kiddos and myself included.  </li>
            <li>The floss glides through so much better.</li>
            <li>, it is also priced well, and you get more in a bag.  </li>
            <li>Chances are, you&#x27;ll end up with a better product.</li>
            <li>Either way, you are going to need to buy some better floss if you are using the Dentek fun flossers, because you will want to have some good stuff on hand for when you have to floss the floss out</li>
            <li>They all love them (ages 5, 3, almost 2).</li>
            <li>and I love stocking up on non-perishables.  </li>
            <li>Kids love the designs</li>
            <li>My kids love these.</li>
            <li>Our favorite floss.</li>
            <li>Love the color options to give them a choice and sense of control.</li>
            <li>Kids love them and I&#x27;ve tried them as well.</li>
            <li>While the colors may vary as others have suggested (our latest packs did not have orange), the kids love flossing with these.</li>
            <li>Colors aside, we care most that they floss</li>
            <li>what is most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>These make flossing so much fun for my two kids - they love it!</li>
            <li>The floss strips are great for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>Wipe that smile off of your face, because this is not a yummy kind of flavor.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and, most importantly, work well.  </li>
            <li>they are so sweet!</li>
            <li>They do not glide easily in between teeth.</li>
            <li>The floss freys and breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>* Easy for kids to hold</li>
            <li>* Disposable and convenient for easy clean-up&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The smell is strong -</li>
            <li>and they work fine on all.  </li>
            <li>But holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>This was a good way for me to introduce flossing to a toddler and allow him to be able to actively participate in flossing his own teeth.</li>
            <li>Unlike the ones I get for adults, they are a finer floss size and fit in kids</li>
            <li>I noticed it was either scented to smell like something I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on, or maybe that was the cheap plastic I was smelling.  </li>
            <li>My kids love the fun colors of these flossers.</li>
            <li>Cheap floss.</li>
            <li>OTOH, my 7 year old daughter loves these because of the taste and bright</li>
            <li>Not only great for adults&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I was happy to find these and will definitely get them again.  </li>
            <li>They enjoy flossing their teeth every night before bed.</li>
            <li>We love these DenTek Fun Flossers.</li>
            <li>They are good flossers that are easy to hold and have no sharp points (except sometimes where the floss itself is tied off on either side of the plastic.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, colorful, and has very mild flavor.</li>
            <li>Dentek Fun Flossers are not made for flossing!  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for small teeth.</li>
            <li>This order came with more packs than I expected (that&#x27;s a good thing).  </li>
            <li>If it makes your dental checkups as easy as it is for our kids, it&#x27;ll be worth every penny you spend and</li>
            <li>My kids enjoy flossing now that they get to use these fun flossers.  </li>
            <li>Our feedback was the price was awesome around $.04/per flosser which was better than any other item on Amazon and each pick would last through each cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>overall quality seems really good, there are no sharp edges, and the kids are able to hold them.</li>
            <li>These are great for little mouths.</li>
            <li>I picked out a fun</li>
            <li>I smelled, or just fun flosser?  </li>
            <li>course, the product isn&#x27;t worth anything if the kid doesn&#x27;t use them..</li>
            <li>The colors and design make flossing fun.</li>
            <li>2year old my baby love it.</li>
            <li>My boys love to use these, and they are perfect sized little hands and little teeth.</li>
            <li>The flossers are colorful and have a good taste as well, so it makes flossing fun for a little one.</li>
            <li>My kids love the smell, the string is long and gentle, and they are easy to hold and</li>
            <li>Plackers are much better and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>They floss on their own EVERY SINGLE EVENING!</li>
            <li>They both willingly use these</li>
            <li>and he actually wants to use them!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll make sure to only buy waxed flossers from now on.</li>
            <li>I have 2 toddlers and this made flossing their teeth at night so much easier!</li>
            <li>No creepy indeterminate smells either.</li>
            <li>Identical packages to what&#x27;s in the local drugstore, and a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but fortunately my 8 year old likes these a lot.</li>
            <li>We had a different brand that we got from a dollar store and they worked much better.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture though-</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed for our preschooler.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t BELIEVE they charged me this much for this!</li>
            <li>fruit smell is reasonable strong when you smell it from the bag, but neither the taste nor the smell are very strong when using individual sticks (I&#x27;ve personally tasted and used a couple).</li>
            <li>The floss is nice and thin and easy to get between my child&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing a toddler so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so much easier and happier for all.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves choosing the color that she wants every night and flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I use them too.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>My kids likes the flavor and will use them, which really is the goal.</li>
            <li>I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>for the kids feedback, there was less hassle, better taste and the handle</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone with kids.</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re supposed to have animal shapes, but honestly they&#x27;re quite hard to see.</li>
            <li>different colors are make my baby choose.choosing color is fun for her.</li>
            <li>The floss has a slightly fruity flavor which should be easily tolerated by kids.</li>
            <li>They are a good size, they are easy for the kids to use and have enough color options to keep them from getting bored with the same colors.</li>
            <li>Also, if you get a large, multi-unit package, these will last forever.</li>
            <li>I loved that these came in bulk but the floss is not easy to get through tight teeth.</li>
            <li>I have a 9 year old and 3 year old.</li>
            <li>We just started flossing my two year old&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li>around 5 or 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>My 7-year old and 4-year old use them</li>
            <li>My 8 &amp; 11 year old complain that these hurt their teeth and gums when they use them.</li>
            <li>This is not a floss for you, if you have very closely packed teeth, even one set of such teeth will rip the floss apart into fibers.</li>
            <li>While the stick itself isn&#x27;t a solid piece of plastic, it is still very durable to hold.</li>
            <li>The floss gets loose and break very easy since my kid has a few teeth close to one another.</li>
            <li>Dentek Fun Flossers are not very fun!  </li>
            <li>As I read a few other reviews, I would agree they are a bit on the sweet side and wonder what the product is- if it contradicts the purpose of flossing in the first place.  </li>
            <li>They are nealy impossible to squeeze through my daughters&#x27; teeth; they are normally great flossers but cried with these.  </li>
            <li>They seem hard to floss, not the smooth glide type you can find for adults.</li>
            <li>(I did not deduct a star for having no pink, since that&#x27;s just a color preference.)</li>
            <li>so the pink ones don&#x27;t get used much.</li>
            <li>but no pink flossers in the bag.</li>
            <li>She gets excited to pick out her bird (blue), elephant (pink), or giraffe (green) floss.</li>
            <li>I understand that blue, green, and orange is more gender neutral than pink, especially with families with no girls, but we miss the pink ones all the same.</li>
            <li>Fluoride free and tough.</li>

            <li> I picked out a fun</li>
            <li> I smelled, or just fun flosser?  </li>
            <li> course, the product isn&#x27;t worth anything if the kid doesn&#x27;t use them..</li>
            <li> The colors and design make flossing fun.</li>
            <li> 2year old my baby love it.</li>
            <li> My boys love to use these, and they are perfect sized little hands and little teeth.</li>
            <li> The flossers are colorful and have a good taste as well, so it makes flossing fun for a little one.</li>
            <li> My kids love the smell, the string is long and gentle, and they are easy to hold and</li>
            <li> Plackers are much better and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> They floss on their own EVERY SINGLE EVENING!</li>
            <li> They both willingly use these</li>
            <li> and he actually wants to use them!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll make sure to only buy waxed flossers from now on.</li>
            <li> I have 2 toddlers and this made flossing their teeth at night so much easier!</li>
            <li> No creepy indeterminate smells either.</li>
            <li> Identical packages to what&#x27;s in the local drugstore, and a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but fortunately my 8 year old likes these a lot.</li>
            <li> We had a different brand that we got from a dollar store and they worked much better.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture though-</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed for our preschooler.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t BELIEVE they charged me this much for this!</li>
            <li> fruit smell is reasonable strong when you smell it from the bag, but neither the taste nor the smell are very strong when using individual sticks (I&#x27;ve personally tasted and used a couple).</li>
            <li> The floss is nice and thin and easy to get between my child&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing a toddler so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so much easier and happier for all.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves choosing the color that she wants every night and flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I like them so much that I use them too.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> My kids likes the flavor and will use them, which really is the goal.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> for the kids feedback, there was less hassle, better taste and the handle</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone with kids.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re supposed to have animal shapes, but honestly they&#x27;re quite hard to see.</li>
            <li> different colors are make my baby choose.choosing color is fun for her.</li>
            <li> The floss has a slightly fruity flavor which should be easily tolerated by kids.</li>
            <li> They are a good size, they are easy for the kids to use and have enough color options to keep them from getting bored with the same colors.</li>
            <li> Also, if you get a large, multi-unit package, these will last forever.</li>
            <li> I loved that these came in bulk but the floss is not easy to get through tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old and 3 year old.</li>
            <li> We just started flossing my two year old&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> around 5 or 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> My 7-year old and 4-year old use them</li>
            <li> My 8 &amp; 11 year old complain that these hurt their teeth and gums when they use them.</li>
            <li> This is not a floss for you, if you have very closely packed teeth, even one set of such teeth will rip the floss apart into fibers.</li>
            <li> While the stick itself isn&#x27;t a solid piece of plastic, it is still very durable to hold.</li>
            <li> The floss gets loose and break very easy since my kid has a few teeth close to one another.</li>
            <li> Dentek Fun Flossers are not very fun!  </li>
            <li> As I read a few other reviews, I would agree they are a bit on the sweet side and wonder what the product is- if it contradicts the purpose of flossing in the first place.  </li>
            <li> They are nealy impossible to squeeze through my daughters&#x27; teeth; they are normally great flossers but cried with these.  </li>
            <li> They seem hard to floss, not the smooth glide type you can find for adults.</li>
            <li> (I did not deduct a star for having no pink, since that&#x27;s just a color preference.)</li>
            <li> so the pink ones don&#x27;t get used much.</li>
            <li> but no pink flossers in the bag.</li>
            <li> She gets excited to pick out her bird (blue), elephant (pink), or giraffe (green) floss.</li>
            <li> I understand that blue, green, and orange is more gender neutral than pink, especially with families with no girls, but we miss the pink ones all the same.</li>
            <li> Fluoride free and tough.</li>
            <li> I bought it some time ago and every single night I have to explain to my two year old twin girls why there is pink on the bag</li>
            <li> I usually just buy one package at a time at the store but this worked out to be much cheaper</li>
            <li> Difficult to get between your teeth, not very sturdy, but okay.  </li>
            <li> The multiple colors make for a fun guessing game; I pick one out and my child guesses what color I have.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer mentioned, there were no pink flossers in the 6 bags of flossers I ordered.</li>
            <li> Then today I was at walmart where I saw the same product with pink.</li>
            <li> There are other brands of flossers that are actually shaped like animals, so I&#x27;ll stick to those.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my 3 y/o isn&#x27;t as excited about using them as I&#x27;d like her to be.  </li>
            <li> After the kids fall dental care cleaning we clearly learned that the rolled floss was too hard for them to properly floss</li>
            <li> Also the space that holds the floss is narrow and sometimes is hard to guide to the right place in my kids mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried using them, but they are too small for adult mouths.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter only complaint is their is not enough of the pink ones.</li>
            <li> my kids both aren&#x27;t fans of pink anyway...  </li>
            <li> I use these flossers on kids aged 2-6</li>
            <li> bought a pack at the store, and it contained green, blue, and orange.  </li>
            <li> have green, blue, and pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so irritated that I spent my money on this misrepresented product, I will never buy from Dentek again.</li>
            <li> You get some pink and green, but mainly blue flossers.</li>
            <li> SO OTHER MAYBE WILL SEE THIS.</li>
            <li> Up until a few months ago, the flossers came with blue, green, orange, and pink colors.</li>
            <li> Contrary to the other review, I did receive 6 packages of 75 count floss picks (Amazon was the seller).  </li>
            <li> Go with the butler crayola or other brands</li>
            <li> She likes to Floss due to these.</li>
            <li> My kids, who are normally great flossers, hated them and complained that they hurt.</li>
            <li> Not as tight as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I literally had to floss with other floss to get the Dentek floss out!  </li>
            <li> The floss is very loose and the prongs of the U are close together, so it is impossible to get the floss between tight teeth near the back of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss does not work well between teeth with tight contacts.</li>
            <li> Unless you have unnaturally wide, big buck teeth, or are a very small child with hardly any teeth at all, Dentek floss is not for you!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I like flossers because it is hard to floss your kids teeth with a regular string of floss, but these are not very good.</li>
            <li> using these as a way to teach little ones to floss&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li> My son whose teeth are tight has trouble getting these in and out of the tooth space because they are flimsy.</li>
            <li> My only cimplant is that the floss doesn&#x27;t have a smooth coating, so it causes a horrible squeaky feeling against teeth.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very hard to pull out of the closely packed teeth due to rough textured string.</li>
            <li> The animal shapes on the front are a little misleading and my kids are sad the actual flossers don&#x27;t look like animals.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> (There is a picture on the front of the package depicting the actual flosser shape, but I failed to see it.)</li>
            <li> My son has these two teeth in the back that got fillings in them and are difficult to get floss between.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was a hippo or a giraffe or</li>
            <li> I will not use these, they were a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Amazon was out of our usual brand.</li>
            <li> She has a very small mouth so all of her teeth are close together with tight contacts.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to get in between teeth</li>
            <li> but they were too big and awkward.</li>
            <li> almost always breaks or loses it&#x27;s tensile strength.</li>
            <li> &amp; I usually go thru 3-5 per child for 1full floss!</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> You know that stuff the dentist puts in your mouth before you get a painful shot?- that sort of tastes like a pina colada, but is by no means an actual pina coloda?  </li>
            <li> Our local pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry this brand, so they get disappointed</li>
            <li> the string is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING,</li>
            <li> I began to floss, and folks, that is where I went wrong.  </li>
            <li> Why wrestle with answers to silly questions like these?  </li>
            <li> A thicker floss is too difficult to get between the teeth without having an accident and hitting her gums.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe I could use them myself too, but I was wrong the floss strip breaks after 2 teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband opened the box and the pack of flossers while I was traveling for work</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re terribly wasteful since each flosser is meant to be used only once, but as caretakers, we do what we have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the dentek brand flossers after using the Plackers brand flossers, and what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son and when they arrived I noticed the flossers looked dirty...</li>
            <li> These are not waxed so they&#x27;re terrible for getting through tight teeth!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get them in between your teeth without breaking them or a filling.</li>
            <li> I tried them myself, and they were painful on my gums and scratched along my teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want my kids being exposed to artificial sweeteners!</li>
            <li> These have horrible artificial sugar coating on the floss part.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> These floss are horrible!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it to anyone, terrible product!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> This floss is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes flossing a toddler so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get between your teeth, not very sturdy, but okay.  Won&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> After we ran out of these, we tried having our nine year use the regular sized/adult flossers but they were too big and awkward. We went back to these. They work well and we have had no issues with shredding or breaking.</li>
            <li> The only way I can get my son to floss without him chomping off my fingers!  He loves the bright colors and flossing is quick and painless.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT LOVE THESE NO WHERE ON THIS PAGE DOES IT MENTION FLORIDE IS IN THE INGREDIENTS! FLORIDE IS POISON!! IT DOES NOTHING FOR YOUR TEETH, ONLY KILLS YOUR HEALTH. FALSE ADVERTISING, LYING AND POISONING YOUR CHILDREN, STAY  AWAY FROM ANYTHING WITH FLORIDE, PLEASE LOOK IT UP. IT DOES NOTHING BUT KILL!!! 0/5 STARS, ONLY PUT IT AS 5 SO OTHER MAYBE WILL SEE THIS. BAN FLORIDE!</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old and 3 year old. They both willingly use these and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the pointy ends. Kids love picking colors.</li>
            <li> Kids love these flossers!  Our local pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry this brand, so they get disappointed whenever I bring something else home for them to use.  We now buy these in bulk so we never run out.  Makes flossing so much easier and happier for all.</li>
            <li> These flossers work great, but just a heads up in case you&#x27;re like me: These flossers are NOT shaped like animals! I bought them specifically because I thought they were, and knew the kids would love them. There are other brands of flossers that are actually shaped like animals, so I&#x27;ll stick to those. (There is a picture on the front of the package depicting the actual flosser shape, but I failed to see it.)</li>
            <li> Terrible. It is a struggle to floss with these. They do not glide easily in between teeth. It is almost impossible to get them in between your teeth without breaking them or a filling. I wish I could return them. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good value</li>
            <li> Good price, bough these on a lightning deal.  We&#x27;re using them to teach my son how to floss and this makes it easier for him.</li>
            <li> We just started flossing my two year old&#x27;s teeth and these are great! She gets excited to pick out her bird (blue), elephant (pink), or giraffe (green) floss. The floss all look the same, but are different colors. I haven&#x27;t experienced the floss breaking or ripping during use. I received six packages with my order and it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> My son loves these more than the minty ones.  Multiple colors and he actually wants to use them! If you got a picky kid, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I tried the dentek brand flossers after using the Plackers brand flossers, and what a disappointment. The floss freys and breaks too easily. The taste isn&#x27;t great. The grip is OK, but I almost always end up using two or more to floss as one almost always breaks or loses it&#x27;s tensile strength. Plackers are much better and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> got this with coupons and great price.</li>
            <li> These get the job done. My kids like the taste, and colors. They are easy to hold and use. My only cimplant is that the floss doesn&#x27;t have a smooth coating, so it causes a horrible squeaky feeling against teeth. My kiddos don&#x27;t complain,  but I tried it, and I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling.</li>
            <li> These are not waxed so they&#x27;re terrible for getting through tight teeth! My kids, who are normally great flossers, hated them and complained that they hurt. I tried one on my own teeth and agreed. We&#x27;ll make sure to only buy waxed flossers from now on.</li>
            <li> We used to get these from Target when we started flossing our toddler. Up until a few months ago, the flossers came with blue, green, orange, and pink colors. They are good flossers that are easy to hold and have no sharp points (except sometimes where the floss itself is tied off on either side of the plastic.) I understand that blue, green, and orange is more gender neutral than pink, especially with families with no girls, but we miss the pink ones all the same. (I did not deduct a star for having no pink, since that&#x27;s just a color preference.)</li>
            <li> I use these for my kids and they work great. Unlike the ones I get for adults, they are a finer floss size and fit in kids teeth quite well. The animal shapes on the front are a little misleading and my kids are sad the actual flossers don&#x27;t look like animals. The do smell good and the kids like that part too.</li>
            <li> My kids and I dislike these flossers.  They are hard to get in between teeth and they complain that they hurt all the time.  They prefer to use the Crayola flossers that their dentist has given them as samples. Will have to buy those next time.</li>
            <li> I have 2 toddlers and this made flossing their teeth at night so much easier! My daughter only complaint is their is not enough of the pink ones.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves choosing the color that she wants every night and flossing is a breeze. I would highly recommend these to anyone with kids.</li>
            <li> These floss are horrible! The smell is strong - I kept wondering whether it&#x27;s safe to floss my kids&#x27; teeth with it. The floss gets loose and break very easy since my kid has a few teeth close to one another. I never had this problem with a variety brands of kids floss before. I do not recommend it to anyone, terrible product!</li>
            <li> I got these and Plackers.  My son has these two teeth in the back that got fillings in them and are difficult to get floss between.  I can count on breaking one of the Dentek flossers each time and needing to get out a second one .  The Plackers that I got never break.  I&#x27;ll finish this pack up on my younger son.</li>
            <li> These flossers are the only floss my child has ever used.  She is now 11 and has been using these since she started flossing her own teeth...around 5 or 6 years old.  They are perfect for smaller hands...easy to grip and maneuver.  They are easy to use and, most importantly, work well.  I like them so much that I use them too.</li>
            <li> Dentek Fun Flossers are not very fun!  I was attracted to the cute packaging at the store, so I bought some to enourage flossing with the kiddos and myself included.  I picked out a fun, animal shaped flosser.  Not sure if it was a hippo or a giraffe or neither... I noticed it was either scented to smell like something I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on, or maybe that was the cheap plastic I was smelling.  I began to floss, and folks, that is where I went wrong.  Dentek Fun Flossers are not made for flossing!  I immediately had pieces of floss stuck in between my teeth.  I literally had to floss with other floss to get the Dentek floss out!  Unless you have unnaturally wide, big buck teeth, or are a very small child with hardly any teeth at all, Dentek floss is not for you!&lt;br /&gt;Also, Dentek is flavored.  Maybe some of you are saying, oooh, flavored, yummy.  Wipe that smile off of your face, because this is not a yummy kind of flavor.  This is more of a trip to the dentist office kind of flavor.  You know that stuff the dentist puts in your mouth before you get a painful shot?- that sort of tastes like a pina colada, but is by no means an actual pina coloda?  It&#x27;s that taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Target&#x27;s, Up &amp; Up brand instead.  The floss glides through so much better., it is also priced well, and you get more in a bag.  No ambiguous girraffes masquerading as hippos (or where they rhinos?). No creepy indeterminate smells either. --like, was that a whiff of Strawberry Shortcake&#x27;s hair I smelled, or just fun flosser?  Why wrestle with answers to silly questions like these?  Save yourself the headache- buy Target, or just something a bit pricier.  Chances are, you&#x27;ll end up with a better product. Either way, you are going to need to buy some better floss if you are using the Dentek fun flossers, because you will want to have some good stuff on hand for when you have to floss the floss out</li>
            <li> Contrary to the other review, I did receive 6 packages of 75 count floss picks (Amazon was the seller).  Identical packages to what&#x27;s in the local drugstore, and a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the product isn&#x27;t worth anything if the kid doesn&#x27;t use them.. but fortunately my 8 year old likes these a lot.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  My kids love the smell, the string is long and gentle, and they are easy to hold and handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was good, too.</li>
            <li> Wish they still had the orange color. You get some pink and green, but mainly blue flossers.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist with 3 children (ages 1-5) and I floss my children&#x27;s teeth every night. My wife purchased these at Target last month.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t recommend this brand. The floss does not work well between teeth with tight contacts. It shreds very easily as well. We had a different brand that we got from a dollar store and they worked much better. I like flossers because it is hard to floss your kids teeth with a regular string of floss, but these are not very good.</li>
            <li> Good product but wish the floss were thinner</li>
            <li> Bought these for my kids after a trip to the dentist. They all love them (ages 5, 3, almost 2). They are easy to use, and have a great shaped handle for the kids to hold. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy one package at a time at the store but this worked out to be much cheaper and I love stocking up on non-perishables.  The multiple colors make for a fun guessing game; I pick one out and my child guesses what color I have.  The floss is nice and thin and easy to get between my child&#x27;s teeth.  She has a very small mouth so all of her teeth are close together with tight contacts.  A thicker floss is too difficult to get between the teeth without having an accident and hitting her gums.</li>
            <li> My kids love the fun colors of these flossers. Makes them eager to floss!</li>
            <li> My kids likes the flavor and will use them, which really is the goal. They seem hard to floss, not the smooth glide type you can find for adults.</li>
            <li> This was a good way for me to introduce flossing to a toddler and allow him to be able to actively participate in flossing his own teeth. The flossers are colorful and have a good taste as well, so it makes flossing fun for a little one.</li>
            <li> I loved that these came in bulk but the floss is not easy to get through tight teeth. Also the space that holds the floss is narrow and sometimes is hard to guide to the right place in my kids mouth.</li>
            <li> The kids love the flavor and with 3 kids, the 3 colors work out perfectly for us. They are flossing!!</li>
            <li> After the kids fall dental care cleaning we clearly learned that the rolled floss was too hard for them to properly floss so we tried these flossers.  Our feedback was the price was awesome around $.04/per flosser which was better than any other item on Amazon and each pick would last through each cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the kids feedback, there was less hassle, better taste and the handle made it easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Horrible. These flosses are not waxed and are the string is very thick.  They are nealy impossible to squeeze through my daughters&#x27; teeth; they are normally great flossers but cried with these.  I tried them myself, and they were painful on my gums and scratched along my teeth.</li>
            <li> We buy these flosses all of the time.  My 7-year old and 4-year old use them and it&#x27;s the only floss they can use that don&#x27;t hurt them or get stuck between their teeth.  They don&#x27;t mind the flavor either.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product! I bought these for my son and when they arrived I noticed the flossers looked dirty... Almost like there is food stuck on the floss themselves. I don&#x27;t know if they are supposed to be this way, but I&#x27;ve never seen this on flossers before.. The point of flossing is to take pieces out from between his teeth, not add stuff. I will not use these, they were a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This floss is horrible.  Shreds immediately / after one or two teeth.  Go with the butler crayola or other brands</li>
            <li> Works well for kids.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon.  Shipped quickly.  Kids love the designs</li>
            <li> My 8 &amp; 11 year old complain that these hurt their teeth and gums when they use them. Amazon was out of our usual brand. I thought these were a bargain but now they sit on the shelf and will be headed towards the trash.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer mentioned, there were no pink flossers in the 6 bags of flossers I ordered. It doesn&#x27;t bother me though-  my kids both aren&#x27;t fans of pink anyway...  The product doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture though- just sayin.  It still was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Fluoride free and tough.</li>
            <li> My kids enjoy flossing now that they get to use these fun flossers.  I have two boys so the pink ones don&#x27;t get used much.</li>
            <li> My kids love these. The colors and design make flossing fun. They are perfect for small teeth. I have tried using them, but they are too small for adult mouths.</li>
            <li> Cheap floss. This is not a floss for you, if you have very closely packed teeth, even one set of such teeth will rip the floss apart into fibers.Very hard to pull out of the closely packed teeth due to rough textured string.</li>
            <li> The floss is very loose and the prongs of the U are close together, so it is impossible to get the floss between tight teeth near the back of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OTOH, my 7 year old daughter loves these because of the taste and bright colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would not buy again</li>
            <li> This order came with more packs than I expected (that&#x27;s a good thing).  Unfortunately, my 3 y/o isn&#x27;t as excited about using them as I&#x27;d like her to be.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s any reflection on the product, she&#x27;s just not into oral care like I am.  As I read a few other reviews, I would agree they are a bit on the sweet side and wonder what the product is- if it contradicts the purpose of flossing in the first place.  I use the flossers if they&#x27;re handy when I happen to need to floss.</li>
            <li> Not only great for adults&lt;br /&gt;but using these as a way to teach little ones to floss&lt;br /&gt;without the hassle of the string version and aversion to taste</li>
            <li> These make flossing so much fun for my two kids - they love it!</li>
            <li> Personally I can&#x27;t stand the fruit flavor, but I don&#x27;t use them. My kids like them and floss every night, so five stars to that!</li>
            <li> These are fun taste great and make flossing easier. My son whose teeth are tight has trouble getting these in and out of the tooth space because they are flimsy. We&#x27;ll probably go back to Plackers next time</li>
            <li> Our favorite floss. The kids can use this on their own easily, then we follow to make sure our tots are doing a food job. Love the color options to give them a choice and sense of control.</li>
            <li> 2year old my baby love it. every day she does herself with flosser.&lt;br /&gt;3~4 different colors are make my baby choose.choosing color is fun for her.</li>
            <li> The floss strips are great for my 2 year old. Bought them to help encourage him to floss. Thought maybe I could use them myself too, but I was wrong the floss strip breaks after 2 teeth.</li>
            <li> My kids love them and the price is the best around.  I was happy to find these and will definitely get them again.  They are a good size, they are easy for the kids to use and have enough color options to keep them from getting bored with the same colors.</li>
            <li> I use these flossers on kids aged 2-6 and they work fine on all.  No issues with shredding whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a pack at the store, and it contained green, blue, and orange.  This 6-pack I got from Amazon all have green, blue, and pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids like them; they smell fruity, but I haven&#x27;t had any comments on flavor.  Honestly have not tried them in my own mouth yet.</li>
            <li> These have horrible artificial sugar coating on the floss part. They will give your children cavities they are so sweet! Will never buy again and threw all mine in the garbage. Don&#x27;t want my kids being exposed to artificial sweeteners! They should put something about ingredients on the package or in the product listing.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product. I bought it some time ago and every single night I have to explain to my two year old twin girls why there is pink on the bag but no pink flossers in the bag. Then today I was at walmart where I saw the same product with pink. I am so irritated that I spent my money on this misrepresented product, I will never buy from Dentek again.</li>
            <li> Kids love them and I&#x27;ve tried them as well. They work great for crowded teeth</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed for our preschooler. Helps her floss effectively.</li>
            <li> These are the only types of Floss my toddler will use. It&#x27;s easy to hold, colorful, and has very mild flavor. She likes to Floss due to these. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product and my kids like flossing their teeth</li>
            <li> Totally misleading. I can&#x27;t BELIEVE they charged me this much for this! RIDICULOUS. Unfortunately, my husband opened the box and the pack of flossers while I was traveling for work (he didn&#x27;t know there were supposed to be 6 packages of 75 count) so now I can&#x27;t return it. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> My boys love to use these, and they are perfect sized little hands and little teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great for little mouths. I have two boys, 4 and 5 and these work wonderfully. They enjoy flossing their teeth every night before bed. Great value.</li>
            <li> We love these DenTek Fun Flossers. While the colors may vary as others have suggested (our latest packs did not have orange), the kids love flossing with these. They floss on their own EVERY SINGLE EVENING! Colors aside, we care most that they floss, that&#x27;s the bottom line and what is most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall quality seems really good, there are no sharp edges, and the kids are able to hold them. I guess they&#x27;re supposed to have animal shapes, but honestly they&#x27;re quite hard to see. While the stick itself isn&#x27;t a solid piece of plastic, it is still very durable to hold. Also, if you get a large, multi-unit package, these will last forever. We&#x27;ve bulk purchased and have had packs lying around for months before we get to using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit smell is reasonable strong when you smell it from the bag, but neither the taste nor the smell are very strong when using individual sticks (I&#x27;ve personally tasted and used a couple). We&#x27;ve never had any snap on us (either the plastic holder or the floss), and I think we&#x27;re on our 10th pack of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a pack, I really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong. If it makes your dental checkups as easy as it is for our kids, it&#x27;ll be worth every penny you spend and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Easy for kids to hold&lt;br /&gt;* Disposable and convenient for easy clean-up&lt;br /&gt;* Can use up to two times each (per our dentist)&lt;br /&gt;* Cost efficient compared with alternatives, especially with Subscribe &amp; Save and these 6 packs&lt;br /&gt;* Each set of 75 comes in its own convenient resealable pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Colors will vary&lt;br /&gt;* More expensive than &amp;#34;non-stick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;non-reusable stick&amp;#34; options</li>
            <li> These make flossing kids&#x27; teeth possible. The floss has a slightly fruity flavor which should be easily tolerated by kids. They&#x27;re terribly wasteful since each flosser is meant to be used only once, but as caretakers, we do what we have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Establishing excellent dental care habits is important in a child&#x27;s life, so get these as soon as the child sprouts a tooth.</li>
            <li> Not as tight as I expected them to be. But holding up just fine. Kids love them. Colors and favors.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money. Floss is so flimsy it breaks when flossing my kids teeth &amp; I usually go thru 3-5 per child for 1full floss! Frustrating.</li>
