            <li> I used this for the first time this morning, and half expected the same yucky experience as I&#x27;ve had with numerous other &amp;#34;natural toothpastes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth out or leave a pasty tongue.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Way less chemicals than regular toothpaste; I also do not like minty toothpaste</li>

            <li> I tried Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh, Deep Sea Spearmint, and was really disappointed with the overpowering mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than with other toothpastes!  </li>
            <li> Repurchase few times.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> so it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using nasty chemicals to clean my teeth!</li>
            <li> It also left a terrible aftertaste, as of an artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> We have researched and checked the ingredients on almost every toothpaste brand out there, and Jason is the one brand that doent&#x27; have any bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> We used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), which is supposed to be bad for you.</li>

            <li> I like it a lot!!! Works great too!!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste with a great flavor. Doesn&#x27;t have any of the nasty chemicals other big brands have like fluoride or SLS, but still works great. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other toothpastes, but it&#x27;s worth it for your health!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste, its a little more expensive than standard toothpaste but worth every dollar. Way less chemicals than regular toothpaste; I also do not like minty toothpaste and this is a mostly cinammon flavor. I also get mouth sores with regular toothpaste, then as soon as I switch back to this my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li> My favorite affordable natural toothpaste. Repurchase few times. Make you teeth feel clean, and I consider myself as pretty picky about my toothpastes. I don&#x27;t like Tom&#x27;s and other drugstore pastes.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, like a mild cinnamon gum.&lt;br /&gt;Mouthfeel is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Rinses out easily and my mouth feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth out or leave a pasty tongue.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to call poison control if you swallow some.</li>
            <li> I love the way this toothpaste makes my mouth feel. I was using this same toothpaste but in the mint flavor BUT I prefer the cinnamon. So this review is specifically for the cinnamon flavored one. My mouth just feels cleaner when I use the cinnamon. It is a more expensive toothpaste compared to common brands but it&#x27;s worth it to me when it comes to my oral health. My kids will use this one but the younger ones (under age 4) do complain that it is spicy if they get too much. So I do caution about that. This toothpaste does foam up when using and it is a paste, not a gel. Two thumbs up from me! It&#x27;s my absolutely favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like the combination of cinnamon and mint!  I like that I&#x27;m not using nasty chemicals to clean my teeth!</li>
            <li> This is my new toothpaste for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I opted to purchase this toothpaste after reading all the positive comments. I must say, I am not disappointed. Only a very small amount is required and it has a very pleasant taste. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  It leaves my mouth fresh and clean feeling without aftertaste or dulled taste buds. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  Everyone in my family uses it, including the grandkids.</li>
            <li> Wow, best toothpaste ever!  My teeth felt so clean they were squeaky.  I will keep ordering this.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste.. Contains no SLS.. Prevents getting cancer sores for me..</li>
            <li> I enjoy this toothpaste as much as Jason powersmile.  I prefer natural toothpaste without fluoride.</li>
            <li> Great taste for a fluoride-free toothpaste.  Been using it for a few years now.  Had a tube once that had air pockets, but other than that, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. ..arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor and texture of this paste. Even though I am not a peppermint liker, the cinnamon tempers the mint so it is not overwhelming. Strong selling factor is Powersmile toothpastes are sans the dreaded fluoride which can cause health complications with continuous use. I like the ingredients, including aloe and camellia sinensis (chamomile), soothing and gentle on gums.</li>
            <li> This was my first ever tube of Jason toothpaste and I love it, love the flavor and love the way it makes a thick (not runny) foam in my mouth. If you like cinnamon you will like this. I will def buy again, wish they had it in subscribe and save!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s free of everything I try to avoid in a toothpaste and the taste is great! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice minty taste with a hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff and I love the new Cinnamon.</li>
            <li> When Tom&#x27;s of Maine was bought out be Colgate, I needed to find another cruelty free toothpaste, as I won&#x27;t buy anything made by Colgate. I tried Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh, Deep Sea Spearmint, and was really disappointed with the overpowering mint flavor.  It also left a terrible aftertaste, as of an artificial sweetener. When I read the good reviews about the cinnamon powersmile I decided to try Jason&#x27;s again, and I am pleasantly surprised with the delicate, yet effective, taste and consistency. I have since tried the vanilla powersmile and love that as well. I am happy to have found this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This has been our favorite toothpaste for a few years now. We love the cinnamon flavor and the pasty texture without being gritty or runny. It helps to whiten teeth. And I love that there is no fluoride.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time this morning, and half expected the same yucky experience as I&#x27;ve had with numerous other &amp;#34;natural toothpastes&amp;#34;. However, the consistency was pleasant, as well as the taste. The color is a gray/white clay color, but I truly appreciate no dyes!! I don&#x27;t care if my toothpaste isn&#x27;t neon red or solar blue!! My teeth felt super clean when I finished, and it didn&#x27;t burn my tongue. It left a very pleasant, mild taste of cinnamon and mint. The whitening effect is still to be determined, but my first impression was, WOW! And I can pronounce everything listed in the ingredients. The only thing I would also like to see absent is the silica, but this is the best alternative paste I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste and what a great value</li>
            <li> Jason products are generally good quality.  This is no exception.  It&#x27;s a bit more watery than I&#x27;m used to, but still a quality product, tastes great (far as toothpastes go) - and best of all, fluoride free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pastie and doesn&#x27;t wash out like commercial toothpastes. I will look for other natural toothpastes to try.</li>
            <li> We have researched and checked the ingredients on almost every toothpaste brand out there, and Jason is the one brand that doent&#x27; have any bad ingredients in it. We used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), which is supposed to be bad for you. Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol. We prefer the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> I loved the taste of the toothpaste.  It leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than with other toothpastes!  Will purchase again!</li>
