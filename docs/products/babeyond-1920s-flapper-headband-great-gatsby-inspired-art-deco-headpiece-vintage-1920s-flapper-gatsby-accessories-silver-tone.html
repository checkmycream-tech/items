            <li>This piece is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>of all, it&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>But beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely beautiful piece.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful headpiece</li>
            <li>Beautiful doesn&#x27;t describe this product.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful headpiece.</li>
            <li>The end result was a gorgeous headband that was perfect for a Great Gatsby inspired Prom.</li>
            <li>This was used to crown the Snow Daze Queen as they had a Great Gatsby themed dance</li>
            <li>I bought this to wear at the Jazz Age Lawn Party and was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>The head band it self was beautiful and came in a nice keepsake box but for some reason the part where it attaches to the ribbon is on the inside of the headband and not the ends.</li>
            <li>i loved the product.</li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>ALL great product Wonderful price highly reccommend</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and received so many complaints!!</li>
            <li>Wore this to a 1920s themed party and I got so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Love the ribbon tie for my hair!</li>
            <li>Absolutely stunning!&lt;br /&gt;Quality was superb.</li>
            <li>Could be put together better and made sure everything was securely glued but still beautiful!!</li>
            <li>Great quality, sturdy, and very sparkly!</li>
            <li>takes a little time to put on as the ribbon does not give perfect support so you need to put some bobby pins for a good support</li>
            <li>I do love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take my advice and spend a couple dollars more on something that has quality and won&#x27;t hurt you.</li>
            <li>This headpiece/ tiara is adorable.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the hair piece</li>
            <li>It fit my head perfectly (and I have a big head -- I can share hats with my boyfriend!)</li>
            <li>Purchased this headband for my younger sister&#x27;s Great Gatsby prom, along with an art deco ring.</li>
            <li>We cut off the 2 metal attachments with wire cutters and filed it smooth with a metal nail file, and then we re-attached the ribbon to the inside metal bracing of the headband.</li>
            <li>It is very beautiful but because it was so heavy</li>
            <li>, I was pretty comfortable for most of the day.</li>
            <li>The headband is very pretty, detailed, and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Its a very eye catchy design and looks adorable.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>It is a bit snug on, or maybe we just have big heads, but we gently bent it to allow a more comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>so that is a reason i deducted one star from my review but other wise</li>
            <li>Very pretty and came exactly as the pictures show.</li>
            <li>just right and not give me a headache.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of bling for my hollywood themed party.</li>
            <li>It stayed on fairly well, but the sides of my head were a little sore at the end of the evening from the sides of the headpiece pushing against my head whenever I chewed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is by far beautiful and has weight so definitely not cheap looking AT</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty when you are not looking up close</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but a little hard to tie on just right to keep it secure...</li>
            <li>I had to stretch the metal very carefully and slowly to fit</li>
            <li>It is extremely heavy for a headpiece, gorgeous but heavy.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing but you must tie it on tight or it will fall down your face and hit the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, delicate and looks far more expensive than it actually is!</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that the metal piece is too small, and I had to bend it open to make it fit on my head.</li>
            <li> The item came already attached to a white ribbon and a separate black one was in the box.</li>
            <li> It did not come with the pink gift box pictured or gift bag, as stated.</li>
            <li> I purchased this headpiece for a prohibition themed party the other night.</li>
            <li> I only took one star off because it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> However, my only complaint is that the ends of the tiara have a piece of metal that sticks out so that the headband can be attached to it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be modeled for the average child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> It has ivory ribbons attached, but came with additional black ribbons to change it up, if you wish.</li>
            <li> The gem/diamond is a little kiddy dress up looking but not noticeable.</li>
            <li> The tiara is heavy and the metal ends dig into the sides of your scalp.</li>
            <li> You will need to get the heavy duty type bobby pins to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> and although by the end of the day, I did feel a slight dull headache from the metal ends digging into my head a bit</li>
            <li> It was also waaaaay to small for my head, so I had to make some adjustments.</li>
            <li> Did not come with a case and it did not fit anyone!</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> We all know that crystals fall off costume pieces and how hard it is to find matching replacements.</li>
            <li> There is a little hook for the ribbon that pushed into my head making it a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Onyl complaint is i had to use like a thousand bobby pins to keep in place.  </li>
            <li> Luckly I bought two versions because I was unable to wear this one due to discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have no safe place to put it!</li>
            <li> It gives a killer headache and is EXTREMELY uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> A little painful after a bit!</li>
            <li> The metal is unforgiving and will gauge in to your head, the stupid ribbon does nothing to hold it in place, and basically just shoddy craftsman ship.</li>
            <li> After a  few hours it became very painful.</li>
            <li> it was very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear in her dance showcase.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 metal pieces (1 on each side) where the ribbon attaches to the headband which make it painful to wear.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> I purchased this headpiece for a prohibition themed party the other night. Overall, I would buy it again. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL. I do love it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not a big deal but it did not come in a box. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy. It was also waaaaay to small for my head, so I had to make some adjustments. This caused some tiny stones to fall out, but I simply collected them and glued them back on.&lt;br /&gt;You might want to consider adding a hair comb to hold it in place (if any dancing is involved), but it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> Purchased this headband for my younger sister&#x27;s Great Gatsby prom, along with an art deco ring. The headband is very pretty, detailed, and sturdy. It has ivory ribbons attached, but came with additional black ribbons to change it up, if you wish. It is a bit snug on, or maybe we just have big heads, but we gently bent it to allow a more comfortable fit. It arrived in 2 days. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Absolutely stunning!&lt;br /&gt;Quality was superb.</li>
            <li> This was used to crown the Snow Daze Queen as they had a Great Gatsby themed dance</li>
            <li> Wore this to a 1920s themed party and I got so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Did not come with a case and it did not fit anyone!</li>
            <li> There are 2 metal pieces (1 on each side) where the ribbon attaches to the headband which make it painful to wear. We cut off the 2 metal attachments with wire cutters and filed it smooth with a metal nail file, and then we re-attached the ribbon to the inside metal bracing of the headband. The end result was a gorgeous headband that was perfect for a Great Gatsby inspired Prom. The only reason this is being given 3 stars instead of 5 stars is because we had to do this modification.</li>
            <li> Great quality, sturdy, and very sparkly!</li>
            <li> Do. It buy this crappy product. Didn&#x27;t come in box and is the most uncomfortable thing ever. The metal is unforgiving and will gauge in to your head, the stupid ribbon does nothing to hold it in place, and basically just shoddy craftsman ship. Take my advice and spend a couple dollars more on something that has quality and won&#x27;t hurt you.</li>
            <li> The head band it self was beautiful and came in a nice keepsake box but for some reason the part where it attaches to the ribbon is on the inside of the headband and not the ends. So the loops dig into your head when you try to wear it. Luckly I bought two versions because I was unable to wear this one due to discomfort.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but a little hard to tie on just right to keep it secure...</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful but because it was so heavy it was very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear in her dance showcase.  Ha to take it out as soon as she was done!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my jprimarprom and boy did it help bring the look together.  I would recommend this to anyone!  It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> A little painful after a bit! But beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful piece. Pictures do not do it justice. However, my only complaint is that the ends of the tiara have a piece of metal that sticks out so that the headband can be attached to it. The tiara is heavy and the metal ends dig into the sides of your scalp. After a  few hours it became very painful. A couple days later, it feels like the sides of my head are bruised. They say beauty is pain,  I received nothing but compliments that night.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my Gatsby-themed prom and it&#x27;s gorgeous! The item came already attached to a white ribbon and a separate black one was in the box. I had to stretch the metal very carefully and slowly to fit just right and not give me a headache. It seemed to be modeled for the average child&#x27;s head. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it did not come with extra jewels/pearls and because it was put into a bag inside the delivery box instead of in a separate &amp;#34;gift box&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as it said and looked. I absolutely love it and received so many complaints!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear at the Jazz Age Lawn Party and was quite happy with it. It fit my head perfectly (and I have a big head -- I can share hats with my boyfriend!) and although by the end of the day, I did feel a slight dull headache from the metal ends digging into my head a bit, I was pretty comfortable for most of the day. It&#x27;s very pretty, delicate and looks far more expensive than it actually is! I totally felt like Daisy Buchanan wearing it. I do recommend it -- I only deducted a star because of the headache ... is there a way to eliminate that?</li>
            <li> This piece is gorgeous! Perfect for a 1920&#x27;s themed party! However, I am giving it 3 stars for the following reasons: It did not come with spare crystals, as stated. We all know that crystals fall off costume pieces and how hard it is to find matching replacements. I was looking forward to having those! It did not come with the pink gift box pictured or gift bag, as stated. I now have to go out and get a box to store it in to prevent oxidation and tarnishing. I have no safe place to put it! It is extremely heavy for a headpiece, gorgeous but heavy. You will need to get the heavy duty type bobby pins to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful headpiece and I received several compliments on it.  It stayed on fairly well, but the sides of my head were a little sore at the end of the evening from the sides of the headpiece pushing against my head whenever I chewed.</li>
            <li> It is postively beautiful! Onyl complaint is i had to use like a thousand bobby pins to keep in place.  It does come with a ribbon but it is not enough support</li>
            <li> just the right amount of bling for my hollywood themed party. This headpiece/ tiara is adorable. I like the intricate design along with the side crown which stands up and makes you feel taller.&lt;br /&gt;This takes a little time to put on as the ribbon does not give perfect support so you need to put some bobby pins for a good support but once you have it on you feel like a princess. Its a very eye catchy design and looks adorable. The listing reads that it comes with spare crystals and a gift box but it did not so that is a reason i deducted one star from my review but other wise i loved the product. I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> beautiful piece!!! There is a little hook for the ribbon that pushed into my head making it a little uncomfortable. Otherwise I love the hair piece</li>
            <li> This is by far beautiful and has weight so definitely not cheap looking AT ALL great product Wonderful price highly reccommend</li>
            <li> Very pretty and came exactly as the pictures show. I only took one star off because it&#x27;s a little heavy and I had to reshape it to my head.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied. The gem/diamond is a little kiddy dress up looking but not noticeable. Love the ribbon tie for my hair! Good job</li>
            <li> Beautiful doesn&#x27;t describe this product. Could be put together better and made sure everything was securely glued but still beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Too small. Hurt head. Couldn&#x27;t wear it. Still waiting for my refund after mailing it back days ago!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful headpiece. It feels sturdy and keeps tied. My only complaint is that the metal piece is too small, and I had to bend it open to make it fit on my head. It arrived in about a week, and was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> This is a substantial piece. It looks amazing but you must tie it on tight or it will fall down your face and hit the bridge of your nose. It is made of metal and can be adjusted for your head width.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty when you are not looking up close but there are the metal bars that stick out on either side that the ribbon is attached to. It gives a killer headache and is EXTREMELY uncomfortable.</li>
