            <li>they are nice and they do work well</li>
            <li>Handy to have.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrushes were very sturdy and the fact that they were pre-pasted made them all the more perfect for our purpose.  </li>
            <li>I have to add more.</li>
            <li>love the price and the number of toothbrushes per pack.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was more toothpaste, and that they were bio-degradable.</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>Easy answer to clean my teeth on the go or while out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK, but many of them don&#x27;t seem to have much if any paste on them.</li>
            <li>They are great for when you are out somewhere and need to clean your teeth and aligners before you put them back in.</li>
            <li>There was barley enough toothpaste to brush one good time.</li>
            <li>I am really upset that I purchased so many.</li>
            <li>The seller was great -- we received these even quicker than expected!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles aren&#x27;t super stuff, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>They are affordable and useful, and our audience loves them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the current toothbrushes wet and day trying to figer out what works best and</li>
            <li>Defintely worth it</li>
            <li>Cheapest I&#x27;ve found and they have just the right amount of &amp;#34;pre paste&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>More sanitary than trying to keep a toothbrush clean and dry while traveling.</li>
            <li>They are pre-pasted and real toothbrushes that you could definitely re-use (adding your own toothpaste).</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed and value priced</li>
            <li>The product came faster than the estimated delivery date  was exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li>They will be an easy addition to the backpack so braces can be brushed after lunch.</li>
            <li>We like these toothbrushes because they are soft and super convenient.</li>
            <li>and now I have some left to use on airplanes for a quick freshen up!</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>My orthodontics office have something similar but far better than these.</li>
            <li>Could use a little more toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but seems they could use a little more paste on them.</li>
            <li>That way if you are running late and forget to take care of your teeth, there is a quick easy way to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are a great product and were purchased for my mother who has arthritis and is unable to squeeze a tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>They always have unexpected friends spending the night.</li>
            <li>well no matter if you wet them first</li>
            <li>i just have her carry a couple new (individually wrapped) ones and throw them out once used.</li>
            <li>Enough toothpaste to brush my 10month old&#x27;s tooth.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was purchased as a donation.  Due to the Ebola infection control measures the troops will require one time use of a toothbrush!  I appreciate the cost and the quantity!  God bless and keep them safe!</li>
            <li> They are a great product and were purchased for my mother who has arthritis and is unable to squeeze a tube of toothpaste.  Great price too!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has braces and i was tired of her having to carry her used toothbrush with her when she was out, with these i just have her carry a couple new (individually wrapped) ones and throw them out once used.</li>
            <li> Love these for on the go! Just what we needed for short trips and keeping in the car.</li>
            <li> Had to have these for my mom&#x27;s medical problem. They&#x27;re OK, but many of them don&#x27;t seem to have much if any paste on them.</li>
            <li> Enough toothpaste to brush my 10month old&#x27;s tooth. And I&#x27;m digging out or choking on all the bristles that come out while I brush. Worst purchase I ever made on Amazon</li>
            <li> We use these at health fairs.  They are affordable and useful, and our audience loves them.  They&#x27;re individually wrapped, and we printed stickers with our health message and contact information on them.</li>
            <li> These are great! They will be an easy addition to the backpack so braces can be brushed after lunch.</li>
            <li> There was barley enough toothpaste to brush one good time. I am really upset that I purchased so many. My orthodontics office have something similar but far better than these.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed and value priced</li>
            <li> We purchased these for a service project we were doing that involved creating bags for the homeless.  The toothbrushes were very sturdy and the fact that they were pre-pasted made them all the more perfect for our purpose.  The price was great, too.</li>
            <li> they are junk, not worth the money, so little tooth paste</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Could use a little more toothpaste. I have to add more.</li>
            <li> Great price. Individually wrapped. They get the job done! Cheapest I&#x27;ve found and they have just the right amount of &amp;#34;pre paste&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product came faster than the estimated delivery date  was exactly what i needed.  Thank you! Having a busy lifestyle,  I can their odd in my gym bag, my car,  my purse fire whenever I need to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy answer to clean my teeth on the go or while out. Especially since I wear braces. Grab a bottle of water to rinse and I&#x27;m good to go at any location.</li>
            <li> I keep a few of these at work and a few in the car. That way if you are running late and forget to take care of your teeth, there is a quick easy way to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles aren&#x27;t super stuff, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums. Mine labeled the brushes made in China and paste made in America.</li>
            <li> These are so handy. I have three teenage boys. They always have unexpected friends spending the night. These are awesome.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.  I recently got Invisalign and wanted something pocket sized, disposable, convenient, and well priced.  These are the best I found.</li>
            <li> Works well for trips or lunches out!&lt;br /&gt; I will order again when we run out.  More sanitary than trying to keep a toothbrush clean and dry while traveling.</li>
            <li> they are nice and they do work well but seems they could use a little more paste on them. By the time you mildy brush your entire mouth the paste is gone.</li>
            <li> They are pre-pasted and real toothbrushes that you could definitely re-use (adding your own toothpaste). Quality product. Better than expected. Happy!</li>
            <li> These are great. Good for traveling or to keep just as an emergency in your bag. Especially great for people with braces or dentures!</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m finding is 1 out of 2 works with as pre past. I was going to puth them in the trash but kept them and will past them and use for my travel road trip.&lt;br /&gt;I love the price and the number of toothbrushes per pack.  I did order anyother brand, I purchased the same brand that the dentist has in his office each one of the samples he gave me all past up very well. He gave me a sample of 5. All 5 worked well. I have tried the current toothbrushes wet and day trying to figer out what works best and what I&#x27;m finding is 1 out of 2 work well no matter if you wet them first are us them from dry.</li>
            <li> These were a great buy for the money. We used them for various things at my daughters wedding and now I have some left to use on airplanes for a quick freshen up!</li>
            <li> Item as expected. Handy to have.  Not a ton of toothpaste on them but enough to her the job done.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more toothpaste, and that they were bio-degradable.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Perfect for on the go anywhere.  Especially for someone like me that is wearing Invisalign.  They are great for when you are out somewhere and need to clean your teeth and aligners before you put them back in.</li>
            <li> Used these pre-pasted toothbrushes for hotel guest welcome baskets for our daughter&#x27;s wedding.  They were perfect!  Using the leftovers at our cottage for guests who forget to pack toothbrushes!  The seller was great -- we received these even quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> love these. convenient for guests who spend the night without preparing a toiletry bag. does the job, however may need additionally toothpaste</li>
            <li> We like these toothbrushes because they are soft and super convenient. Defintely worth it yay</li>
