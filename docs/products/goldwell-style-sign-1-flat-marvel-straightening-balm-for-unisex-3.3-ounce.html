            <li>This product is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It kind of made my hair a bit flat</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed to get great results and it allows one to extend the time between haircuts!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and i love the flat marvel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, the product leave my hair feel a little crunchy and doesn&#x27;t really give it a smooth and glossy effect.</li>
            <li>I stumble upon it and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair extra straightening boost, I use just before flat iron, in addition to Elixir - good combo</li>

            <li>If I&#x27;m in a rush, I just put some in my hands after my shower and run it through my hair, controls frizz really well.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair looking natural and very pliable.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, greasy, or oily and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>You could buy something from the drug store, but I like the professional quality of Goldwell products.</li>
            <li>Just have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>A little bit of this helps my hair blow dry smooth w/o frizz.  </li>

            <li> and I wonder how I ever flat ironed my hair without it</li>
            <li> My flat iron glides through my hair and my style stays all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> Flat Marvel Straightening Balm does the job!  </li>
            <li> and I always have a hard time getting my hair straight .</li>
            <li> use this in combination with the Keratin Complex Straight Day Hair Spray.</li>
            <li> Product was destroyed package was a complete mess , stuff was everywhere!</li>
            <li> I attempted various other products until I found this one and would not settle for anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> I used it after I dry my hair, before I use the straightening iron.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I air dry</li>
            <li> It made my hair like dry straw.  </li>
            <li> The is a product I CAN NOT live without.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you have thick coarse curly hair and need something to help w/ the unruliness, this is for you</li>
            <li> It works well to tone down the frizz and waves after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> It does straighten my hair and makes it look healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too thick or heavy like some similar products.</li>
            <li> Got a bottle of this a few years ago upon suggestion from my stylist.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a product in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, the only con is the price: I go through a bottle of this every 2 weeks, so it gets expensive.</li>
            <li> and I hardly have to use a straightner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not to crunchy, hard, or shiny.</li>
            <li> My sister just has thick hair and when she uses it she does not even have to use the starlightner.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair, and I thought from the reviews that I had read, this would be a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> or I have a bad flat iron.</li>
            <li> It could just be I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>

I am very selective about hair products and have tried so many straightening products. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product mells wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy.  Makes straightening so much quicker and easier. I love it.</li>
            <li> Helps to control frizz</li>
            <li> This is the best.  My husband and  I both use it !  It has been an important part of our haircare for years!</li>
            <li> My daughter and i love the flat marvel. It makes blow drying quicker and helps keeps hair straight longer. Great product.</li>
            <li> After trying endless products throughout the years, I can say with complete certainty that this one is truly the best.

It is very light-weight, has pleasant fragrance and, on a side note, helps the hair stay fresh and clean longer during the day. Amazing!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a salon pro, so I searched for it on Amazon. It arrived quickly and has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my flyaway, super-curly hair, even in Florida.  I will keep it in my cupboard in good supply. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product was destroyed package was a complete mess , stuff was everywhere!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does straighten my hair and makes it look healthier and less frizzy. I used it after I dry my hair, before I use the straightening iron. It&#x27;s been part of my routine for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Loved this. Just have to be careful not to use too much or it gets greasy fast.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Cheaper than getting from the salon and works everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the Keratin Complex Straight Day Hair Spray.</li>
            <li> No so good because it does not hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair extra straightening boost, I use just before flat iron, in addition to Elixir - good combo</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, that I like to straighten from time to time.  A little bit of this helps my hair blow dry smooth w/o frizz.  Sometimes, I air dry and it reduces frizz a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Always keep some on hand and use it to travel where humidity is an issue!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have to use a ton of it (around 4-5 pumps... lots of coarse, wavy hair to straighten), but it makes my hair feel shiny and soft and not greasy or waxy/stiff like some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the only con is the price: I go through a bottle of this every 2 weeks, so it gets expensive. Totally worth the expense in my book.</li>
            <li> Flat Marvel Straightening Balm does the job!  It makes my hair smooth, glossy, and protects it against heat damage.  It also has a great fragrance that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The is a product I CAN NOT live without. I have very thick hair that take forever to dry and then on top of that it is an ackward wavy. With this my hair dries on like 5 minutes with a hair dryer and I hardly have to use a straightner afterwards. My sister just has thick hair and when she uses it she does not even have to use the starlightner. Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> my hairdresser used this and i am wowed. awed. exceptionally light feel - not \\&quot;producty\\&quot; feeling at all. doesn&#x27;t add weight. i have thick, curly hair and this straightened it but left it shiny, very movable, and straight until the next wash. i couldn&#x27;t wait to order it.</li>
            <li> It works well to tone down the frizz and waves after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair, and I thought from the reviews that I had read, this would be a miracle worker.  It made my hair like dry straw.  Wished it had worked.</li>
            <li> I received a small tube of the Goldwell Flat Marvel Straightening balm for Christmas and after the first use I ordered a big bottle online. Works great for Thin/fine hair. Highly recommend this product and you only need a small amount so it last a while</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I have curly hair I straighten and use it before the straightening iron and it helps smooth it out.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. Love this!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products of all time. Makes blowouts easier and quicker and seems to really smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> Best product in the world for sleek hair!</li>
            <li> I tried this because I saw a video on utube about Goldwell products.  It kind of made my hair a bit flat but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The only thing I did not like was the scent.  It was very pungent to me.  I wanted to try the jelly boost.  I guess maybe some time I&#x27;ll try that.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the price.  Only a small amount is needed to get great results and it allows one to extend the time between haircuts!  I attempted various other products until I found this one and would not settle for anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, the product leave my hair feel a little crunchy and doesn&#x27;t really give it a smooth and glossy effect.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It&#x27;s not sticky, greasy, or oily and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. My hair was still kinda curly. All it did was take some frizz out. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this straightening balm is very good and very reasonable in price. You could buy something from the drug store, but I like the professional quality of Goldwell products. If you have thick coarse curly hair and need something to help w/ the unruliness, this is for you</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! Works great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. This is my second bottle and I wonder how I ever flat ironed my hair without it</li>

If I&#x27;m in a rush, I just put some in my hands after my shower and run it through my hair, controls frizz really well. If I have time to style, curl or straighten, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
            <li> The best straightening product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My son has straight hair that is starting to get wavy as he gets older.  This works well to keep the waves in line.</li>
            <li> I use this product exclusively on my bangs to protect them from my straightener. It&#x27;s great! My hair stays straight longer (even in humidity) and is always shiny and lovely after I use it.</li>
            <li> Its a very good hair styling product. I stumble upon it and glad I bought it. Makes your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product as a sample. Once I tried it, I knew it had to be staple in my hair routine. Smells great. Works great!</li>
            <li> I like it. It smells good. But I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. It could just be I&#x27;m doing something wrong or I have a bad flat iron. I have thick wavy shoulder length hair and I always have a hard time getting my hair straight .</li>
            <li> Goldwell straightening lotion is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my hair. My flat iron glides through my hair and my style stays all day. It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a product in it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use it all the time, Definitely recommend, easy to use and works great, would hate to be without it!</li>
            <li> Not to crunchy, hard, or shiny. This product leaves your hair looking natural and very pliable.</li>
