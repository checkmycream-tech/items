            <li>This butter kind of surprised me because it takes quite a bit of heat to melt.</li>

            <li>moisturizes very well, like coconut but has a higher melting temperature</li>
            <li>The shipping cost was also very high</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying the mango butter works well and last for along time price could be better but it&#x27;s worth it</li>

            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I wish I could have international shipping service, I paid a high fee up to even in Saudi Arabia, Thanks</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be more of a creamy butter, similar to Shea butter consistency so that I could blend it in with my other natural oils that I put in my hair</li>

            <li>It melts quickly in my hands, very soft  scent &amp; blend well with other oils</li>

            <li> The consistency and texture was also not smooth, as it had little fine grains all through.  </li>
            <li> is a little greasy, but leaves the skin vey soft.</li>
            <li> I took a dime size and put some on my lip which are always dry</li>
            <li> and if you have dry crack feet order it now</li>
            <li> It is somewhat firm at room temp.but melts into your skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I like this brand as it is less refined.</li>
            <li> But after an hour it still wasn&#x27;t even half way melted.</li>
            <li> but oddly it didnt smell like mango</li>
            <li> The product spilled a little</li>
            <li> I guess I was not prepared for how raw this is.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and living in an arid climate makes this condition even worse.</li>
            <li> and then this is what I received- a product which I am not satisfied with.</li>
            <li> I usually like to heat a small pot of water and just place the container in it.</li>
            <li> The product is unusable,it is as hard as a rock,even heated ,when it cools it is unusable.</li>
            <li> The mango butter was too hard.  </li>
            <li> It was in hard balls.</li>
            <li> I melt it in a pot which sets in another pot with slow boiling water.</li>
            <li> Subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return the product and received a very rude and impolite answer:&amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was advertsied as raw, but was sorely disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I like it but I have to buy more ingredient to put in it I wanted it to be what I order but it were not.</li>
            <li> This product was not raw.  It had the coloring and texture of refined mango butter.  I bought it because it was advertsied as raw, but was sorely disappointed.  The consistency and texture was also not smooth, as it had little fine grains all through.  I will not purchase again.  The shipping cost was also very high and then this is what I received- a product which I am not satisfied with.</li>
            <li> The product is unusable,it is as hard as a rock,even heated ,when it cools it is unusable.There is no date,when it was produced.I wanted to return the product and received a very rude and impolite answer:&amp;#34;If you don&#x27;t know how to use it,don&#x27;t buy&amp;#34;.I won&#x27;t recommend this product and this web-sight for multiple reasons.</li>

            <li> so much and for such a great price, this was truly a smart buy. I hope to buy from this seller again when this is finished</li>
            <li> this butter was so easy to use in my  project, i will be ordering it again... thank you Jean H</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be more of a creamy butter, similar to Shea butter consistency so that I could blend it in with my other natural oils that I put in my hair and it was not. I actually would not purchase this again and I guess depending on what you are looking to use this for I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it either.</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great and I use it for my body &amp; hair</li>
            <li> This butter kind of surprised me because it takes quite a bit of heat to melt. I usually like to heat a small pot of water and just place the container in it. But after an hour it still wasn&#x27;t even half way melted. Currently I use it as is on my skin.</li>
            <li> So soft:) Came in quickly and I use it for my own lotion and it works really well:)</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and living in an arid climate makes this condition even worse. A friend told me about mango butter as a good moisturizer so I looked for it on line and an amazon affiliate had it in a 1 lb jar at a very good price.so I placed an order, received it 3 days later and my dry skin is has been happy ever since. This mango butter is very good quality, unscented, and un processed. It is somewhat firm at room temp.but melts into your skin almost instantly. A little bit goes a long way, I use it daily on my arms and hands, the skin absorbs it like a sponge and becomes smooth and soft not greasy at all. I love this stuff, I have not found a better product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of our favorite lip balm ingredient because scent is very mild and its soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> i like it so much but the packing want good and it melt, so i keep it in a cold place. so i mix it later in my cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it to make lotion bars, and muscle healing balms. Great feeling on skin and also love the natural smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for lotions and soaps. I was amazed at the size of this jar and the amount of product in it. I am definitely ordering more from this seller. :-)</li>
            <li> excellent product i use it every day. would not know how to act if i didn&#x27;t use it. highly reccomended</li>
            <li> moisturizes very well, like coconut but has a higher melting temperature so it is much more work to make it maliable</li>
            <li> is a little greasy, but leaves the skin vey soft. do not have any fragance., for me is good becuse sometimes perfums gave me allergy. So you can add any fragance to it. For the price it is a lot mango butter</li>
            <li> Inlove with this butter. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I made a hair cream with she butter. The mango butter was too hard.  It was in hard balls.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use in my soap making recipes. I was happy with the packaging, it came in a heavy plastic jar with a screw top lid. It was crumbly in appearance and texture but was very soft and melted nicely. It did not have a strong scent at all which was nice and lends well for soap making. I will be purchasing this product again in the future</li>
            <li> This butter is so soft and smooth, i buy natural butters for my hair; but this buuter always wound up on my skin.</li>
            <li> Used it in body butter... Worked out great, easy to use in skin care recipes. Look forward to seeing what else I can use it in.</li>
            <li> I give it a five star thank you . This is my second time buying the mango butter works well and last for along time price could be better but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I order this product for it&#x27;s ability to moisturize the skin as well as the hair. I&#x27;m a natural with type 3c and 4a hair which means my hair needs all the moisture it can get. Once order it came on time I opened it up and smelled it but oddly it didnt smell like mango so I thought to myself I wont put this on my icecream. I took a dime size and put some on my lip which are always dry and it worked amazingly needless to say my hair loved it to. So the big question will I oder again YES and if you have dry crack feet order it now lol.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use in pretty much in all my body butter recipes. It is hard like cocoa butter, melts pretty easy. I melt it in a pot which sets in another pot with slow boiling water. Makes your skin so soft. I do recommend mango butter to every one I know.</li>
            <li> I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought this for my mother and her friend and is happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt; I wish I could have international shipping service, I paid a high fee up to even in Saudi Arabia, Thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great to use alone or w aloe vera and shea butter. I loved it for my son&#x27;s eczema and my own natural hair.</li>
            <li> The product spilled a little</li>
            <li> very rich and silky, makes the best lip balm ever!!!</li>
            <li> I guess I was not prepared for how raw this is. I have purchased raw mango butter before and it had a smooth consistency. I have to melt and mix this one to soften.</li>
            <li> Love this mango butter! Great container nice butter! Perfect purchase!</li>
