            <li>Really great brushes do the job perfectly so many types of brushes to choose from highly recomend these brushes there really soft except one of my brushes broke but really easy to fix</li>
            <li>These brushes are exceptional professional quality.</li>
            <li>All in all I really love these brushes and would recommend them to any first time brush buyers or makeup beginners that don&#x27;t want to spend $50-$100 on name brand brush sets.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so cheap and so good, I bought these brushes and within a week my order came (even though it said it was scheduled to come 2 weeks after it actually did)</li>
            <li>They are top quality and really work with any makeup foundation</li>
            <li>all of the brushes are extremely soft and the face brushes are nice and dense, they did have a bit of a chemical smell to them</li>
            <li>They are soft and seem nice but are at every similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these brushes - do their job well, don&#x27;t shed as much, have a peculiar smell in the beginning that fades away quick.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the handles come off on them - not properly glued - super glue them and you&#x27;ve gotten yourself an awesome deal!</li>
            <li>They are rill soft and they look rill spassive love them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more for my daughters-in-law and adult granddaughters.  </li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t anything I didn&#x27;t expect) but with the help off some super glue that problem was fixed very quickly.</li>
            <li>The package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Right up there with my $30 brushes that I paid for one brush.</li>
            <li>well once you find the right one.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ll fall right</li>
            <li>I use one of the small ones for concealer which works great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these brushes, its illogical how other people pay hundreds of dollars for brushes that dont even compare to the price they are paying for.</li>
            <li>these came in very fast.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast too!</li>
            <li>Smells funny too.</li>
            <li>Pretty on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>I had to use hot silicone because sometimes the gold part would come off because i washed them</li>
            <li>My white set is lovely, no chemical smell, no shedding, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the big ones for foundation and powder because it really helps even out the products.</li>
            <li>They broke really fast after washing them</li>
            <li>üòçüòç thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>The ones that are not broken are very</li>
            <li>Decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>brushes of this high quality for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but I like when the small brushes are more fine and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Air dry goes back to its original state.</li>
            <li>there are so soft</li>
            <li>n feel so soft.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and conservative with product.  </li>

            <li> These brushes are amazing! They are top quality and really work with any makeup foundation/blush I use. The hairs on these brushes are quality and its such a bargain what I paid for! I am very pleased with these brushes, its illogical how other people pay hundreds of dollars for brushes that dont even compare to the price they are paying for.

            <li> These brushes are so cheap and so good, I bought these brushes and within a week my order came (even though it said it was scheduled to come 2 weeks after it actually did) all of the brushes are extremely soft and the face brushes are nice and dense, they did have a bit of a chemical smell to them but it was nothing a wash couldn&#x27;t fix.

            <li> Ok so they aren&#x27;t $500 brushes, but for the price they are great.  I&#x27;ve had no issue w shedding.  Nice variety of shapes. Pretty on my vanity.  And they all work to apply makeup well once you find the right one.</li>
            <li> nice quality for the price..</li>
            <li> brushes are excellent  I don&#x27;t even use my other expense of brushes anymore  I highly recommend them</li>

            <li> üôäüôä  bomb!!!! There very soft and nice feeling and great on your skin..you can do everything with these brushes i recommend these to everyone who needs good brushesüòä</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning.  Air dry goes back to its original state. Bristles don&#x27;t shed and makeup gets applied evenly.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes yesterday n they look so cute n feel so soft. I love them. I havent use them yet but im really excited to use them from now on, Update&amp;#62; the brushes worked as it says they will work, i was so in love with them. since i used them on a daily basis since i got them, i wash them at least 1 time a week and as of right now, two of the face brushes hair got loose and they didnt fall, they went inside the brush and i couldnt get them out lol but they are great brushes for the price. I had to use hot silicone because sometimes the gold part would come off because i washed them but that wasnt a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> Decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good for a set of cheap brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes came within 4days of purchase which was great. The brushes on the other hand smelled really bad and are very hard. Not sure if I will use them.</li>
            <li> Great set at a great price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and seem nice but are at every similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 6/11/15&lt;br /&gt;by this point, they do not hold their shape and the gold part has come off the handle on all the larger brushes. very low quality.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes!  But one brush has glue covering it, so I only could give 4 stars for this purchase.</li>
            <li> these came in very fast. they are really nice dense brushes. I love the big ones for foundation and powder because it really helps even out the products. I use one of the small ones for concealer which works great. the small ones are too big for my eyeshadow crease though... they are very soft but a little big. they don&#x27;t blend eyeshadow well but I like when the small brushes are more fine and fluffy. not dense. but pretty good quality</li>
            <li> The best I have ever bey!!! They are rill soft and they look rill spassive love themüòçüòçüòç thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> They are great brushes. They look the same as in the picture. They don&#x27;t feel cheap. Its a very good buy.</li>
            <li> I love the set. My money was well-spent on this one!</li>
            <li> Items arrived broken. The ones that are not broken are very loose.&lt;br /&gt;i tried to put them back together but they&#x27;ll fall right off.&lt;br /&gt;and the smell is horrible, instant migraine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will update review  after contacting seller</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful brushes.  They are extremely soft and conservative with product.  It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to buy wool (not synthetic!) brushes of this high quality for such a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m buying more for my daughters-in-law and adult granddaughters.  I should add that mine was shipped from a seller in the USA so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s the same product that is now coming from China.  My white set is lovely, no chemical smell, no shedding, etc. but can&#x27;t guarantee that everything is still the same.</li>
