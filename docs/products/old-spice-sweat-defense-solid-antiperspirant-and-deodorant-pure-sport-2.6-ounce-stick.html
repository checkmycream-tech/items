            <li>They&#x27;d better not!!  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pure sport&amp;#34; is fairly unisex, and does a great job for both of us in controlling odor and sweat.  </li>
            <li>This is the best antiperspirant &amp; deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find at this price point.  </li>

            <li>it smells really good on him</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think sweat defense is fair to say.  </li>
            <li>It works and has a really good fragrance</li>
            <li>I wanted to stop sweat and smell good.</li>
            <li>Good sweat protection as the name would suggest.</li>
            <li>Smells good though</li>
            <li>Good price on a multi-pack</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s the perfect deodorant: effective, easy to use, smells good.</li>
            <li>Great Scent, lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has it for a great price and even better if you get it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>this is the Best product you can buy; there is something in it that makes you more at ease, and plus the product is not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes and it washes out easily...</li>
            <li>need I say more!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it effective in reducing sweat.</li>
            <li>It is Nice to have a stock and not wait for sales.</li>
            <li>I thought I got a good deal on these, but they all have a sticky residue on top.</li>
            <li>, my fiance really loved that scent more than what is out there now.  </li>
            <li>I believe that Old Spice is a great product!!  </li>
            <li>WAS the best (clear cap).</li>
            <li>Since that day, I had been the perfect &amp;#34;Zombie Consumer&amp;#34; for Old Spice:</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I, like many guys have an issue with excess sweating, it happens, get over it snobs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how many things I&#x27;ve tried, basically every deodorant known to man.  </li>
            <li>If this works for me it&#x27;ll surely work for you.</li>
            <li>Works okay as an Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, James \\&quot;Jim\\&quot; Wheeler.</li>
            <li>These are not \\&quot;solid\\&quot; solids, they are the softer type that squish through the holes at the top of the stick.  </li>
            <li>I do not have much more to say on that matter.</li>
            <li>Still, it works well, and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and it was my favorite.</li>
            <li>This deodorant used to be awesome but they recently changed the formula.</li>
            <li>Works well for me and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>This came as a four pack and love the convenience of not needing to go to the grocery store to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>Ok?  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more liquid product</li>
            <li>Will keep using it till I can find something better though.</li>
            <li>This deodorant basically changed my life, love</li>
            <li>I was happy with what I was purchasing, and to be honest, the Old Spice marketing campaign had had its desired effect on my pubescent brain.</li>
            <li>, I’m not coming here saying I could do better.</li>
            <li>, I’m not coming here saying I could do better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleaned the top with soapy water, but every time he rolls more up, more sticky stuff comes out with the deodorant.</li>
            <li>simply the best non-prescription strength deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>Love the subscribe and save and having more show up when you are just about to run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found its so much better to buy in bulk.  </li>
            <li>Glad I am able to obtain it here though.</li>
            <li>It has never irritated me, and it even smells nice and is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>and WOW-WE I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put this one became even more of a man.</li>
            <li>Love the 4 pack I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>it was much more feminine smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than 10years, and I still buy them at Walmart in bulk.</li>
            <li>much more needed out of a deodorant</li>
            <li>That would feel good, right?</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and fair price.</li>
            <li>good price, but have to apply a lot for adequate protection as compared to gillette advanced</li>
            <li>Strangely 1 of the 4 was in perfect condition, making me question its age</li>
            <li>This scent is good but isn&#x27;t as good as &#x27;Showtime.&amp;#34;  I totally recommend soft-solids for others.</li>
            <li>Great product and super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to overuse it since you crank out the stuff, and as a guy I always overdo it.</li>
            <li>As someone who suffer from a intense perspiration under the arm pit, this is by far the best solution that I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hubby really smells delicious with this Old Spice...</li>
            <li>This is really a strong antiperspirant to cover the smell, yes it works.</li>
            <li>Okay, since it&#x27;s Old Spice maybe I should be thinking of pirates of the Caribbean but still, the days before good de-odering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If your buying this in the summer or it happens to show up during a warm period be ready for melted deodorant!  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Probably works fine if you&#x27;re in to gel/paste applications.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you are aware of your own body and how it responds to heat, moisture, etc.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t lose a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do alot in the actual antiperspirant area, however it does manage to still smell great even when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li>So I texted my friend Chris and asked him if he had ever experienced such a thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, that doesn’t sound like something a „man“ needs, but</li>
            <li>To me, that doesn’t sound like something a „man“ needs, but</li>
            <li>My pits aren&#x27;t filled with paste anymore.</li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant that last all day.  </li>
            <li>It also smells cool, not fruity or overly strong.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, keeps me so fresh and so clean..</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the clicks because they provide a consistent use and help you not over-apply like you can do with gels and solids that just turn without clicking.</li>
            <li>“ If you’ve ever used a men’s Deodorant before, you’re probably familiar with the dispensation method.</li>
            <li>problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know why they added this little porous hole filter, so I googled „Old Spice porous hole filter“ and found this explanation: „Product dispenses through holes for ideal application amount.</li>

            <li>Love the soft solid, great price</li>
            <li>I remember being about 12-years-old, walking into my childhood bedroom, and finding a passive-aggressively-placed stick of Old Spice deodorant sitting on my bed, lovingly placed there by my mother.</li>
            <li>Luckily sticking them in the fridge for a couple hours did the trick</li>
            <li>And it runs out fairly quickly, in my experience.</li>
            <li>It used to be pleasantly mild, and now is chemically and over-cologney.  </li>
            <li>M A N Y  years and any guy out there that has knows what a super product it is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this same brand and smell of years because I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything better.</li>
            <li>This deoderant is great as an antiperspirant, but it leaves dark marks on clothing that do not go away until washed.</li>
            <li>It works great and keeps a long lasting scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>defense ii thought t would be more like the old school Ray Lewis ravens or Super Bowl Seahawks not the Jacksonville jaguars.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a great scent and works really well, plus you don&#x27;t have to use very much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>*smile*</li>
            <li>No irritations and get absorbed well into the skin, does not smudge clothing at all.  </li>
            <li>Most gels and clear products don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those rare people that never sweats under their arms.  </li>
            <li>I never thought armpits could smile, until I decided to start wearing this deodorant.</li>
            <li>As i expected it and more, perhaps one of the best products for this sensitive area of the human body.</li>
            <li>Completely dry off your armpits before applying the deodorant (very, very important!)</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t smell right...</li>
            <li>Nuff said right?</li>
            <li>It says „Sweat Defense“ right on the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new red-capped version is too strong IMO.  </li>
            <li>The only one he&#x27;ll use and best price, hands down, on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant and when I forgot to purchase it recently I had to rely on Amazon to get it to me quickly.</li>
            <li>b/c I smell amazing all day long.</li>
            <li>When I am going to something formal in hot weather that I can&#x27;t avoid, I use Sweat Block that is a true miracle cure for people like me as far as I am concerned, and available here on Amazon as well.  </li>
            <li>“ I would say to remove this ridiculous porous tube filter non-sense, and get back to doing what Old Spice does best: Convincing pubescent boys that they are going to attract more girls by wearing a specific kind of Deodorant (Old Spice), and thereby creating life-long customers.</li>

            <li>I would say that the only drawback is that its aroma is very strong the first couple hours of wearing it, so I don&#x27;t put it on if I shower within 3 hours of going to bed.</li>
            <li>and then my pits itch, but always dry and smelling nice</li>
            <li>And at the same time, as these boys are being told they are becoming men, ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO BECOME MEN by giving them the freedom to decide their own application</li>
            <li>And at the same time, as these boys are being told they are becoming men, ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO BECOME MEN by giving them the freedom to decide their own application</li>
            <li>This anti perspirant is the only one that keeps him dry and smelling good, and his shirts free from odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Old Spice Deodorant for a long time and this is my favorite of their Red Zone line (pleasant, not overpowering smell, lasts all day &amp; through workouts.)</li>
            <li>It actually lasts a full 24 hours between showers, and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The white antiperspirant stick they make clogs your pours up better but cakes and flakes when you lather it on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat anymore, it&#x27;s kind of alarming</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One type for use which I no longer use myself but did for about a year when I first started using this.</li>
            <li>: Wait, is it a creamy white stick that comes out of the pores on the top of the Deodorant tube?&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I&#x27;ve started doing this with many products I simply write out fewer lists and make fewer trips to stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is still my current favorite.</li>
            <li>So, I think this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>first of all if you have any heat rash or dryness under your arm</li>
            <li>have tried many different deodorants on the market, and I sweat a lot, and this has held up time and time again.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to Old Spice from Gillette about a year back, and I&#x27;m super happy I did.</li>
            <li>put on too much at first - get a feel for how much you need.  </li>
            <li>It especially good at getting me through those moments when its not really all that hot, but I usually am sweating bullets anyway.  </li>
            <li>can say that I have tried almost everything, incluiding very strong products such as Odaban and others anti perspirants, but no one beats Old Spice Sweat Defense.</li>
            <li>I actually believed (to some degree) that wearing the scents offered by Old Spice would net me more attention from females and make me more of a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve written Old Spice and they have confirmed the smell change and also the fact that they will not be bringing back the original smells.</li>
            <li>I also use the &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scented shower gel, and the two scents do not match.</li>
            <li>Only deodorant I have found that keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>Every time I was near the end of a tube of deodorant, I would walk into the super-market, walk directly to the hygiene section (making sure I didn&#x27;t ever allow my curious gaze to wander across the &amp;#34;feminine hygiene products&amp;#34; for more than an acceptable amount of time), and pick-up the first stick of Old Spice deodorant I saw.</li>
            <li>Recommends 2 clicks per use, but that doesn&#x27;t really work so do 3</li>
            <li>They must be absolutely bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need too much of it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant</li>
            <li>I have used some sort of Old Spice deodorant for years, and when I found this stuff I tried it on my forehead on the first really hot day and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>but this is tried and trusted and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>Works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li>You still sweat but not as much and keeps the the odor at bay.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a soft solid -</li>
            <li>I love this soft solid form of antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stop the sweating completely, but it was much better than dripping and being totally embarrassed at times like I was before.  </li>
            <li>At least for a good bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love how this type (white) never gives me a rash as opposed to the clear or gel version.</li>
            <li>For the first two days, I didn’t really think much of it, and blamed it on the new Euro-Style shirts I was wearing.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the pure sport scent more than any other while i just like that it works.</li>
            <li>first noticed this sweat-drop phenomenon about a week after arriving in Germany and beginning to use this new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still willing to try something new</li>
            <li>But if I could sit-down right now with someone at Old Spice, I would say this: „Treat your customers the way you want them to feel: like MEN.</li>
            <li>But if I could sit-down right now with someone at Old Spice, I would say this: „Treat your customers the way you want them to feel: like MEN.</li>
            <li>I have been using the old spice sweat defense pure sport deodorant for a long time and have always enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>At very nearly prescription strength (19% vs 20% gly prescription), this is the real deal and much cheaper and easier to obtain in comparison.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this product for as long as its available</li>
            <li>normally i sweet a lot, and i have tried a bunch of different deodorants</li>
            <li>I sweat a bit more than average and since switching from speedstick</li>
            <li>If you sat me down and told me to make a better Deodorant, I couldn’t do it.</li>
            <li>If you sat me down and told me to make a better Deodorant, I couldn’t do it.</li>
            <li>Just a little magic in the world—not too much.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my most recent purchase the scent wasn&#x27;t the same as it had always been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others before this and in recent years tried others and I always come back.</li>
            <li>First of all: Don&#x27;t Buy This or any of the new deodorants from Old</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Took off one star because I think they have changed the formula recently - the old one had a clear cap and wasn&#x27;t as strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since Tony Steward originally started endorsing it back in the early 2000&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>So then you twist a little knob at the bottom of the tube, which then causes a platform to raise, on which the chemically stuff stick sits, thereby allowing more of the chemically stuff to stick-out-of the tube, and therefore reach your arm-pit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it has a fresh smell that my wife just can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products and so far, this is the only one I could find that works for me!</li>
            <li>The other three were fine</li>
            <li>Its not super strong smelling and does a decent job of preventing sweat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this stuff does work very wll under your arms judging by the vast amounts of positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li>: I got new Deo</li>
            <li>New scent and</li>
            <li>New smell is overpowering and has a cologne type smell to it.</li>
            <li>New inactive ingredients: cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, synthetic wax, tribehenin, paraffin.</li>
            <li>, so I wanted to make sure that I brought enough American Deodorant with me for six-months, just in-case German super-markets didn’t have normal Deodorant with Iron or whatever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the stick type deodorants leave a pretty thick residue that gets on the clothes easy.  </li>
            <li>Did Old Spice even do consumer testing before they released this GARBAGE!?</li>
            <li>Talc and herbs and Old Spice!</li>
            <li>Especially my forehead and face on really hot days.  </li>
            <li>After your first application and putting the cap back on the deodorant, it starts forming hard flakes on the top.</li>
            <li>Although when it arrived, it was clear that the product had melted at some point throughout the shipping process because the deodorant is coming out of the top very unevenly.</li>
            <li>The soft solid glides on smooth and dry and covers the underarm area completely.  </li>
            <li>Do we have to send little men on big rockets to the sky to retrieve more, when the world&#x27;s armpits start sweating again?</li>
            <li>on a busy day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve scrubbed them but can&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what my relationship with Old Spice Deodorant was until about three weeks</li>
            <li>Yeah, I’m using this Old Spice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until this changes, however, I will not be using Old Spice Deodorant anymore, and</li>
            <li>Do you really want to use a Deodorant that promises to make you a man, but at the same time treats you like a child?</li>

            <li>Do you really want to use a Deodorant that promises to make you a man, but at the same time treats you like a child?</li>
            <li>Recently they changed the smell of this whole line and now it is just nauseating.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and used Mitchum for the longest time as it was supposed to be the strongest - but recently the Mitchum stuff got really</li>
            <li>And I naturally sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Recommended to all that prefer Old Spice as their deodorant.  </li>
            <li>( I have a complete review of it at its Amazon site).  </li>
            <li>I trust the old spice sweat defense over anything else i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have used Old spice deodorant for</li>
            <li>only more people who rode public transport would do the same along with washing up regularly.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for an effective antiperspirant and/or deodorant, but alas this is not that product.  </li>
            <li>Actual result for me was similar to most other AP&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Do you know what it’s like to be sitting in a room full of cute foreign-girls, trying to impress them with your ability to correctly spell the word „Siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebzig“, and all-the-while to feel little droplets of sweat form in your arm-pits and then slowly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The same basic idea applies to this product, but instead of just allowing the chemically stuff stick to stick out of the tube, it is first filtered through a series of porous holes.</li>
            <li>But since Sweat Block is pretty costly to use all the time, I have learned to supplement it with this stuff for every day use and more casual affairs.  </li>
            <li>You are telling me that Old Spice, a product which is supposed to increase the manliness of (or the female impression of the manliness of) its user, is putting little tiny porous holes on the top of the Deodorant tube in order to create the „ideal application amount“?</li>

            <li>I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION.</li>
            <li>I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION.</li>
            <li>not only does that plastic screen get hot, quick, each little dispenser pore grabs a hair and yells, &amp;#34;Hang on!&amp;#34; in a frequency only your dog can hear.</li>
            <li>If you see any in the store with a clear cap, get em, because the new red-capped version is totally different and smells like the rest of what is on the market.</li>
            <li>The clear gel types take awhile to dry and really stain the heck out of clothes.  </li>
            <li>The key is to try the process completely from top to bottom for at least a week.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After awhile you should be able to eliminate steps and switch back to morning showers (at least based on my experience).</li>
            <li>Very sweaty commercial with red, orange, and brown colors, almost made me want to sweat while watching that</li>
            <li>\\&quot;The deodorant for guys that truly sweat, it gets the job done that no other deodorant would\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this since it came out as Red Zone but will now be dropping all of the Old Spice products I use.</li>
            <li>Rub into the armpit until the solid has turned _completely</li>
            <li>So I went to my local super-market and stocked-up with four tubes of my old-classic: Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve found no one else who makes anything similar.  </li>
            <li>I actually picked this Old Spice sweat defense up by mistake</li>
            <li>Old Spice rocks for those that don&#x27;t want to smell like a prepubescent teen.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the gel-like liquid, and have always disliked the gel deodorants, but this one lasts a full 24 hours for me and is now the only one I will ever buy.  </li>
            <li>What does it mean that Old Spice wants to tell me how much chemically Deodorant stuff I need to apply to my arm-pits?</li>
            <li>What does it mean that Old Spice wants to tell me how much chemically Deodorant stuff I need to apply to my arm-pits?</li>
            <li>Dry pits are essential to modern living and this products handles that issue.</li>
            <li>(A little wet when first applied just like under your arms, but it dries fast and you get used it</li>
            <li>different one over the years and have now been using Old Spice Red Zone for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>But after a few more days, wearing a few of my trusty America shirts, and still noticing the sweat-drops, I knew something was up.</li>
            <li>I like to use a light base coat of the latter and then apply this product for more protection.</li>
            <li>It was a guy wearing heavy dirt bike riding gear, while riding his quad on hot sand dune hills...</li>
            <li>I understand (logically) how little sense it makes to believe such things, but you have to understand that I had no motivation or impetus to change the (somewhat-silly) beliefs that had been instilled in my at-the-time-pubescent brain.</li>
            <li>It was such a great 10+ year product. :(</li>
            <li>me preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice customer for as long as I&#x27;ve been regularly producing arm-pit sweat.</li>
            <li>particular product is solid, but is pushed through small holes in a plastic screen, so it&#x27;s not like the old push-pop style block of solid deoderant.  </li>

            <li> this is the Best product you can buy; there is something in it that makes you more at ease, and plus the product is not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes and it washes out easily...</li>
            <li> need I say more!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it effective in reducing sweat.</li>
            <li> It is Nice to have a stock and not wait for sales.</li>
            <li> I thought I got a good deal on these, but they all have a sticky residue on top.</li>
            <li> , my fiance really loved that scent more than what is out there now.  </li>
            <li> I believe that Old Spice is a great product!!  </li>
            <li> WAS the best (clear cap).</li>
            <li> Since that day, I had been the perfect &amp;#34;Zombie Consumer&amp;#34; for Old Spice:</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I, like many guys have an issue with excess sweating, it happens, get over it snobs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how many things I&#x27;ve tried, basically every deodorant known to man.  </li>
            <li> If this works for me it&#x27;ll surely work for you.</li>
            <li> Works okay as an Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Sincerely, James \\&quot;Jim\\&quot; Wheeler.</li>
            <li> These are not \\&quot;solid\\&quot; solids, they are the softer type that squish through the holes at the top of the stick.  </li>
            <li> I do not have much more to say on that matter.</li>
            <li> Still, it works well, and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> This deodorant used to be awesome but they recently changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Works well for me and love the scent.  </li>
            <li> This came as a four pack and love the convenience of not needing to go to the grocery store to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> Ok?  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more liquid product</li>
            <li> Will keep using it till I can find something better though.</li>
            <li> This deodorant basically changed my life, love</li>
            <li> I was happy with what I was purchasing, and to be honest, the Old Spice marketing campaign had had its desired effect on my pubescent brain.</li>
            <li> , I’m not coming here saying I could do better.</li>
            <li> , I’m not coming here saying I could do better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned the top with soapy water, but every time he rolls more up, more sticky stuff comes out with the deodorant.</li>
            <li> simply the best non-prescription strength deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> Love the subscribe and save and having more show up when you are just about to run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found its so much better to buy in bulk.  </li>
            <li> Glad I am able to obtain it here though.</li>
            <li> It has never irritated me, and it even smells nice and is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> and WOW-WE I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I put this one became even more of a man.</li>
            <li> Love the 4 pack I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it was much more feminine smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than 10years, and I still buy them at Walmart in bulk.</li>
            <li> much more needed out of a deodorant</li>
            <li> That would feel good, right?</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and fair price.</li>
            <li> good price, but have to apply a lot for adequate protection as compared to gillette advanced</li>
            <li> Strangely 1 of the 4 was in perfect condition, making me question its age</li>
            <li> This scent is good but isn&#x27;t as good as &#x27;Showtime.&amp;#34;  I totally recommend soft-solids for others.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to overuse it since you crank out the stuff, and as a guy I always overdo it.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffer from a intense perspiration under the arm pit, this is by far the best solution that I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hubby really smells delicious with this Old Spice...</li>
            <li> This is really a strong antiperspirant to cover the smell, yes it works.</li>
            <li> Okay, since it&#x27;s Old Spice maybe I should be thinking of pirates of the Caribbean but still, the days before good de-odering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If your buying this in the summer or it happens to show up during a warm period be ready for melted deodorant!  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Probably works fine if you&#x27;re in to gel/paste applications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that you are aware of your own body and how it responds to heat, moisture, etc.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t lose a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do alot in the actual antiperspirant area, however it does manage to still smell great even when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> So I texted my friend Chris and asked him if he had ever experienced such a thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, that doesn’t sound like something a „man“ needs, but</li>
            <li> To me, that doesn’t sound like something a „man“ needs, but</li>
            <li> My pits aren&#x27;t filled with paste anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant that last all day.  </li>
            <li> It also smells cool, not fruity or overly strong.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, keeps me so fresh and so clean..</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the clicks because they provide a consistent use and help you not over-apply like you can do with gels and solids that just turn without clicking.</li>
            <li> “ If you’ve ever used a men’s Deodorant before, you’re probably familiar with the dispensation method.</li>
            <li> problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know why they added this little porous hole filter, so I googled „Old Spice porous hole filter“ and found this explanation: „Product dispenses through holes for ideal application amount.</li>

            <li> Love the soft solid, great price</li>
            <li> I remember being about 12-years-old, walking into my childhood bedroom, and finding a passive-aggressively-placed stick of Old Spice deodorant sitting on my bed, lovingly placed there by my mother.</li>
            <li> Luckily sticking them in the fridge for a couple hours did the trick</li>
            <li> And it runs out fairly quickly, in my experience.</li>
            <li> It used to be pleasantly mild, and now is chemically and over-cologney.  </li>
            <li> M A N Y  years and any guy out there that has knows what a super product it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same brand and smell of years because I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything better.</li>
            <li> This deoderant is great as an antiperspirant, but it leaves dark marks on clothing that do not go away until washed.</li>
            <li> It works great and keeps a long lasting scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> defense ii thought t would be more like the old school Ray Lewis ravens or Super Bowl Seahawks not the Jacksonville jaguars.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a great scent and works really well, plus you don&#x27;t have to use very much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> *smile*</li>
            <li> No irritations and get absorbed well into the skin, does not smudge clothing at all.  </li>
            <li> Most gels and clear products don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those rare people that never sweats under their arms.  </li>
            <li> I never thought armpits could smile, until I decided to start wearing this deodorant.</li>
            <li> As i expected it and more, perhaps one of the best products for this sensitive area of the human body.</li>
            <li> Completely dry off your armpits before applying the deodorant (very, very important!)</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t smell right...</li>
            <li> Nuff said right?</li>
            <li> It says „Sweat Defense“ right on the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new red-capped version is too strong IMO.  </li>
            <li> The only one he&#x27;ll use and best price, hands down, on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant and when I forgot to purchase it recently I had to rely on Amazon to get it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> b/c I smell amazing all day long.</li>
            <li> When I am going to something formal in hot weather that I can&#x27;t avoid, I use Sweat Block that is a true miracle cure for people like me as far as I am concerned, and available here on Amazon as well.  </li>
            <li> “ I would say to remove this ridiculous porous tube filter non-sense, and get back to doing what Old Spice does best: Convincing pubescent boys that they are going to attract more girls by wearing a specific kind of Deodorant (Old Spice), and thereby creating life-long customers.</li>

            <li> I would say that the only drawback is that its aroma is very strong the first couple hours of wearing it, so I don&#x27;t put it on if I shower within 3 hours of going to bed.</li>
            <li> and then my pits itch, but always dry and smelling nice</li>
            <li> And at the same time, as these boys are being told they are becoming men, ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO BECOME MEN by giving them the freedom to decide their own application</li>

            <li> This anti perspirant is the only one that keeps him dry and smelling good, and his shirts free from odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice Deodorant for a long time and this is my favorite of their Red Zone line (pleasant, not overpowering smell, lasts all day &amp; through workouts.)</li>
            <li> It actually lasts a full 24 hours between showers, and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The white antiperspirant stick they make clogs your pours up better but cakes and flakes when you lather it on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat anymore, it&#x27;s kind of alarming</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One type for use which I no longer use myself but did for about a year when I first started using this.</li>
            <li> : Wait, is it a creamy white stick that comes out of the pores on the top of the Deodorant tube?&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve started doing this with many products I simply write out fewer lists and make fewer trips to stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless, it is still my current favorite.</li>
            <li> So, I think this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> first of all if you have any heat rash or dryness under your arm</li>
            <li> have tried many different deodorants on the market, and I sweat a lot, and this has held up time and time again.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Old Spice from Gillette about a year back, and I&#x27;m super happy I did.</li>
            <li> put on too much at first - get a feel for how much you need.  </li>
            <li> It especially good at getting me through those moments when its not really all that hot, but I usually am sweating bullets anyway.  </li>
            <li> can say that I have tried almost everything, incluiding very strong products such as Odaban and others anti perspirants, but no one beats Old Spice Sweat Defense.</li>
            <li> I actually believed (to some degree) that wearing the scents offered by Old Spice would net me more attention from females and make me more of a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written Old Spice and they have confirmed the smell change and also the fact that they will not be bringing back the original smells.</li>
            <li> I also use the &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scented shower gel, and the two scents do not match.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I have found that keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> Every time I was near the end of a tube of deodorant, I would walk into the super-market, walk directly to the hygiene section (making sure I didn&#x27;t ever allow my curious gaze to wander across the &amp;#34;feminine hygiene products&amp;#34; for more than an acceptable amount of time), and pick-up the first stick of Old Spice deodorant I saw.</li>
            <li> Recommends 2 clicks per use, but that doesn&#x27;t really work so do 3</li>
            <li> They must be absolutely bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need too much of it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant</li>
            <li> I have used some sort of Old Spice deodorant for years, and when I found this stuff I tried it on my forehead on the first really hot day and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> but this is tried and trusted and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li> You still sweat but not as much and keeps the the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a soft solid -</li>
            <li> I love this soft solid form of antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stop the sweating completely, but it was much better than dripping and being totally embarrassed at times like I was before.  </li>
            <li> At least for a good bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love how this type (white) never gives me a rash as opposed to the clear or gel version.</li>
            <li> For the first two days, I didn’t really think much of it, and blamed it on the new Euro-Style shirts I was wearing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the pure sport scent more than any other while i just like that it works.</li>
            <li> first noticed this sweat-drop phenomenon about a week after arriving in Germany and beginning to use this new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still willing to try something new</li>
            <li> But if I could sit-down right now with someone at Old Spice, I would say this: „Treat your customers the way you want them to feel: like MEN.</li>
            <li> But if I could sit-down right now with someone at Old Spice, I would say this: „Treat your customers the way you want them to feel: like MEN.</li>
            <li> I have been using the old spice sweat defense pure sport deodorant for a long time and have always enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li> At very nearly prescription strength (19% vs 20% gly prescription), this is the real deal and much cheaper and easier to obtain in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this product for as long as its available</li>
            <li> normally i sweet a lot, and i have tried a bunch of different deodorants</li>
            <li> I sweat a bit more than average and since switching from speedstick</li>
            <li> If you sat me down and told me to make a better Deodorant, I couldn’t do it.</li>
            <li> If you sat me down and told me to make a better Deodorant, I couldn’t do it.</li>
            <li> Just a little magic in the world—not too much.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my most recent purchase the scent wasn&#x27;t the same as it had always been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others before this and in recent years tried others and I always come back.</li>
            <li> First of all: Don&#x27;t Buy This or any of the new deodorants from Old</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Took off one star because I think they have changed the formula recently - the old one had a clear cap and wasn&#x27;t as strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since Tony Steward originally started endorsing it back in the early 2000&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> So then you twist a little knob at the bottom of the tube, which then causes a platform to raise, on which the chemically stuff stick sits, thereby allowing more of the chemically stuff to stick-out-of the tube, and therefore reach your arm-pit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it has a fresh smell that my wife just can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products and so far, this is the only one I could find that works for me!</li>
            <li> The other three were fine</li>
            <li> Its not super strong smelling and does a decent job of preventing sweat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this stuff does work very wll under your arms judging by the vast amounts of positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li> : I got new Deo</li>
            <li> New scent and</li>
            <li> New smell is overpowering and has a cologne type smell to it.</li>
            <li> New inactive ingredients: cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, synthetic wax, tribehenin, paraffin.</li>
            <li> , so I wanted to make sure that I brought enough American Deodorant with me for six-months, just in-case German super-markets didn’t have normal Deodorant with Iron or whatever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the stick type deodorants leave a pretty thick residue that gets on the clothes easy.  </li>
            <li> Did Old Spice even do consumer testing before they released this GARBAGE!?</li>
            <li> Talc and herbs and Old Spice!</li>
            <li> Especially my forehead and face on really hot days.  </li>
            <li> After your first application and putting the cap back on the deodorant, it starts forming hard flakes on the top.</li>
            <li> Although when it arrived, it was clear that the product had melted at some point throughout the shipping process because the deodorant is coming out of the top very unevenly.</li>
            <li> The soft solid glides on smooth and dry and covers the underarm area completely.  </li>
            <li> Do we have to send little men on big rockets to the sky to retrieve more, when the world&#x27;s armpits start sweating again?</li>
            <li> on a busy day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve scrubbed them but can&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my relationship with Old Spice Deodorant was until about three weeks</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m using this Old Spice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until this changes, however, I will not be using Old Spice Deodorant anymore, and</li>
            <li> Do you really want to use a Deodorant that promises to make you a man, but at the same time treats you like a child?</li>

            <li> Recently they changed the smell of this whole line and now it is just nauseating.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and used Mitchum for the longest time as it was supposed to be the strongest - but recently the Mitchum stuff got really</li>
            <li> And I naturally sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Recommended to all that prefer Old Spice as their deodorant.  </li>
            <li> ( I have a complete review of it at its Amazon site).  </li>
            <li> I trust the old spice sweat defense over anything else i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used Old spice deodorant for</li>
            <li> only more people who rode public transport would do the same along with washing up regularly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an effective antiperspirant and/or deodorant, but alas this is not that product.  </li>
            <li> Actual result for me was similar to most other AP&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Do you know what it’s like to be sitting in a room full of cute foreign-girls, trying to impress them with your ability to correctly spell the word „Siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebzig“, and all-the-while to feel little droplets of sweat form in your arm-pits and then slowly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The same basic idea applies to this product, but instead of just allowing the chemically stuff stick to stick out of the tube, it is first filtered through a series of porous holes.</li>
            <li> But since Sweat Block is pretty costly to use all the time, I have learned to supplement it with this stuff for every day use and more casual affairs.  </li>
            <li> You are telling me that Old Spice, a product which is supposed to increase the manliness of (or the female impression of the manliness of) its user, is putting little tiny porous holes on the top of the Deodorant tube in order to create the „ideal application amount“?</li>

            <li> I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION.</li>
            <li> I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION.</li>
            <li> not only does that plastic screen get hot, quick, each little dispenser pore grabs a hair and yells, &amp;#34;Hang on!&amp;#34; in a frequency only your dog can hear.</li>
            <li> If you see any in the store with a clear cap, get em, because the new red-capped version is totally different and smells like the rest of what is on the market.</li>
            <li> The clear gel types take awhile to dry and really stain the heck out of clothes.  </li>
            <li> The key is to try the process completely from top to bottom for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After awhile you should be able to eliminate steps and switch back to morning showers (at least based on my experience).</li>
            <li> Very sweaty commercial with red, orange, and brown colors, almost made me want to sweat while watching that</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The deodorant for guys that truly sweat, it gets the job done that no other deodorant would\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since it came out as Red Zone but will now be dropping all of the Old Spice products I use.</li>
            <li> Rub into the armpit until the solid has turned _completely</li>
            <li> So I went to my local super-market and stocked-up with four tubes of my old-classic: Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve found no one else who makes anything similar.  </li>
            <li> I actually picked this Old Spice sweat defense up by mistake</li>
            <li> Old Spice rocks for those that don&#x27;t want to smell like a prepubescent teen.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the gel-like liquid, and have always disliked the gel deodorants, but this one lasts a full 24 hours for me and is now the only one I will ever buy.  </li>
            <li> What does it mean that Old Spice wants to tell me how much chemically Deodorant stuff I need to apply to my arm-pits?</li>
            <li> What does it mean that Old Spice wants to tell me how much chemically Deodorant stuff I need to apply to my arm-pits?</li>
            <li> Dry pits are essential to modern living and this products handles that issue.</li>
            <li> (A little wet when first applied just like under your arms, but it dries fast and you get used it</li>
            <li> different one over the years and have now been using Old Spice Red Zone for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> But after a few more days, wearing a few of my trusty America shirts, and still noticing the sweat-drops, I knew something was up.</li>
            <li> I like to use a light base coat of the latter and then apply this product for more protection.</li>
            <li> It was a guy wearing heavy dirt bike riding gear, while riding his quad on hot sand dune hills...</li>
            <li> I understand (logically) how little sense it makes to believe such things, but you have to understand that I had no motivation or impetus to change the (somewhat-silly) beliefs that had been instilled in my at-the-time-pubescent brain.</li>
            <li> It was such a great 10+ year product. :(</li>
            <li> me preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice customer for as long as I&#x27;ve been regularly producing arm-pit sweat.</li>
            <li> particular product is solid, but is pushed through small holes in a plastic screen, so it&#x27;s not like the old push-pop style block of solid deoderant.  </li>
            <li> : This specific version of the deodorant has never functioned properly for me, and furthermore, evidences an extreme lack of respect on the part of Old Spice in regard to its customers and their sweat-prevention habits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot, so I usually just apply it before I go to the gym.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems to last a really long time.</li>
            <li> They also advised me to not use any remaining sticks that I may have of the original smell - seems kinda odd and gets me somewhat worried that they realized something bad about their original smell product.  </li>
            <li> but i was sent a different product with with white or grey cap you can see i think its not the one that i choose its absoultely not right</li>
            <li> Also lasts a long time using just two or three clicks per use.</li>
            <li> As long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Gels are always wet and gooey, while solids don&#x27;t cover properly and often crumble.  </li>
            <li> Have used for 15 years and will continue to use as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> (I mean REALLY</li>
            <li> the fact that we&#x27;re putting questionable substances (so says the girl in the Moo-Moo down the streets that always smells like patchouli and wildly overgrown armpit sweat) under our arms, where there is always skin-to-questionable-substances-to-skin contact, all day worth a break in price?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> -- this should be air dry, not just towel dry.</li>
            <li> Allow your armpits to air dry again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always dry after getting home from work.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and stink-free all day</li>
            <li> It will dry and leave removable stain clothing.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the defense I was looking for, Didn&#x27;t keep me dry, thought since it&#x27;s called</li>
            <li> During your next application, you will delight in it scratching your underarm, and flakes falling down your body like it&#x27;s snowing.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that keeps down the body smell.</li>
            <li> and I leaned back and put my hands behind my head and then got all nervous realizing that I always have sweaty underarms - took a look and all was clear.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;soft solid&amp;#34; for years and am finding it harder and harder to locate in stores.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like a gel, but without that wet sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this deodorant and have used it for several years, but they recently changed the scent without warning and it&#x27;s become really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Every time you turn the little knob, approximately twelve dozen (or „a gross“ if you are British or whatever) tiny strands of chemically Deodorant stuff stick out of the tube, waiting to be smeared on your arm</li>
            <li> you turn the little knob, approximately twelve dozen (or „a gross“ if you are British or whatever) tiny strands of chemically Deodorant stuff stick out of the tube, waiting to be smeared on your arm</li>
            <li> (A little goes a long ways, use sparingly).  </li>
            <li> This is a process I learned somewhere for use of prescription deodorant for users who have extreme sweat problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even browse the other brands—why should I have?</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t even know where to begin building the chemically Deodorant stuff inside the tube (other than Iron, I guess).</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t even know where to begin building the chemically Deodorant stuff inside the tube (other than Iron, I guess).</li>
            <li> The other day I was talking with some friends</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it seems like there is not very much deodorant on the inside.</li>
            <li> : Dude, about four or five times a day, I feel these large sweat bubbles pileup in my arm-pit, and they fall onto my flank, and it feels really weird.</li>
            <li> The smell of all the Old Spice Sweat Defense products smells very similar to me, but it keeps me from smelling bad, so I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> When you rub this stuff on your arm-pit, it wears down the stick of chemically stuff, until it no longer sticks-out of the tube, and can’t reach your skin.</li>
            <li> do like it, but little ol&#x27; me will just do with the Other Leading Brands, set-that-pit-on-fire, alcohol based &amp;#34;sporty scent&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
            <li> Its dispensed as a thin, wet white gel from holes as you turn the knob.</li>
            <li> Needed this product, a slight savings buying online.  </li>
            <li> slowly, these fellas drag it out) drip down your sides?</li>
            <li> but one of them did leak a little</li>
            <li> Little picky</li>
            <li> Remember how you could take the PlayDough and shove it through the little holes in order to create dozens of spaghetti-noodle-looking strands of PlayDough (and then make your little-cousin eat it)?</li>
            <li> I go through these things faster than I have any other deodorants I used in the past.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross; it smears so easy, and the worst part when you sweat</li>
            <li> (also very important)&lt;br /&gt;6) Sleep in a cold bedroom if you can to prevent yourself from sweating again</li>
            <li> and if it is dried out...    </li>
            <li> However, all my work shirts and my t-shirts have yellow stains now which I never experienced before.</li>
            <li> it is awful, please go back to the original</li>
            <li> My son sweats heavy and due to various medications he takes, he stinks.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that Old Spice seems to be simply chasing cheaper costs and the teen market (overpowering scent and ridiculous marketing).</li>
            <li> I prefer the shower gel&#x27;s &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scent, but the this one isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Not much more you can ask for in an deodorant, amirite?</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was Amazon or shipping</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will probably be moving on to a different deodorant.</li>
            <li> Solids are hit or miss usually.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I&#x27;ve used in the past, I always had pit stains even with an undershirt.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is weird, but I&#x27;ve had women hug me, then plant their nose in my pit and breath deep...  </li>
            <li> Instead of the usual \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper and fail just as routinely as &amp;#34;The Grey Poupon&amp;#34; of sweat-absorbing-questionable-substances.</li>
            <li> It is easily the worst deodorant I have ever used now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, every-single-time I want to put Deodorant on, I have to turn the stupid little knob, because the process of rubbing the tube on my arm-pit completely removes all of the chemically Deodorant stuff strands sitting on the surface of the porous tube-filter.</li>

            <li> have both used this deodorant for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already used at least one of them.</li>
            <li> Even worse is that it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> but I hate aerosols and gels take too long to dry.  </li>
            <li> No more for me!</li>
            <li> Assuming the stick has already been &amp;#34;started&amp;#34;, click the wheel three times (no more!)</li>
            <li> Gross and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It disappears immediately when hitting the skin like a gel does, but it doesn&#x27;t have the cold wet feeling of a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> Every stick I received was broken where the deodorant comes out</li>
            <li> but I ordered a 4 pack and one of them arrived broken.</li>
            <li> i hope not lol</li>
            <li> I thin</li>
            <li> Now completely disgusting after their &amp;#34;formula change&amp;#34; (red cap).</li>
            <li> get me wrong, I&#x27;m no dummy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years, but it can be expensive.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately I sweat just about everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s dangerous, I have whatever it&#x27;s going to give me...</li>
            <li> I usually buy a dozen at a time, just in case they decide, in some insane moment, to discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> I thought I just encountered a bad batch, however every stick I get does this now.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> it feels weird and disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> whatever that crap is that prevents you from sweating.  </li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> Vegan/Vegetarian folk, and remembered that I had once met a Vegan at a folk-dance in Chicago who told me that Deodorant was evil for some reason that had to do with Iron or something</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good deal. Satisfied. Good transaction.</li>
            <li> It disappears immediately when hitting the skin like a gel does, but it doesn&#x27;t have the cold wet feeling of a gel deodorant. Also lasts a long time using just two or three clicks per use. I love the clicks because they provide a consistent use and help you not over-apply like you can do with gels and solids that just turn without clicking.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. Although when it arrived, it was clear that the product had melted at some point throughout the shipping process because the deodorant is coming out of the top very unevenly.</li>
            <li> always works. smells good. no complaints here. best price i can find anywhere. hope this helps others with their decision.</li>
            <li> Dry pits are essential to modern living and this products handles that issue.</li>
            <li> I, like many guys have an issue with excess sweating, it happens, get over it snobs.  I don&#x27;t even know how many things I&#x27;ve tried, basically every deodorant known to man.  When companies started putting out \\&quot;Prescription strenth\\&quot; sticks I tried them all, nothing worked.  I gave this a try as last ditch effort, and it actually works.  Recommends 2 clicks per use, but that doesn&#x27;t really work so do 3 and you&#x27;ll be fine.  If this works for me it&#x27;ll surely work for you.</li>
            <li> Good scent and lasts for about a month or so. Works okay as an Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> My job causes me to sweat, stop sweating, sweat again, for an hour or so each teaching fitness classes. This stuff keeps me tolerable all day. I have used it for years now. I would say that the only drawback is that its aroma is very strong the first couple hours of wearing it, so I don&#x27;t put it on if I shower within 3 hours of going to bed.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant. My husband&#x27;s been using it for 15 years. The only one he&#x27;ll use and best price, hands down, on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> This is a great anti-perspirant to use.  I believe that Old Spice is a great product!!  Sincerely, James \\&quot;Jim\\&quot; Wheeler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since the day it hit the store shelves.  It&#x27;s one of the few antiperspirants that REALLY works for me.  It actually lasts a full 24 hours between showers, and that&#x27;s important to me.  I usually buy a dozen at a time, just in case they decide, in some insane moment, to discontinue it.  They&#x27;d better not!!  *smile*</li>
            <li> The sticks were melted when I got them (the deodorant inside the case).  Luckily sticking them in the fridge for a couple hours did the trick and they hardened back up.</li>
            <li> We order it over and over and over again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant on the market.  It also contains an obscene amount of aluminum zirconium or whatever that crap is that prevents you from sweating.  So it probably isn&#x27;t good for you, but if you&#x27;re like me and you just don&#x27;t give a damn, then as I mentioned, its the best darn under arm coating on the market!</li>
            <li> Just received it and found this is NOT solid stick deodorant. Quite disappointed. Probably works fine if you&#x27;re in to gel/paste applications.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and it works for me.  It also smells cool, not fruity or overly strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good price.</li>
            <li> Love the soft solid, great price</li>
            <li> If your buying this in the summer or it happens to show up during a warm period be ready for melted deodorant!  They didnt explode but one of them did leak a little and I had to pound them on the table to force the deodorant back to the bottom as it all settled on the side (they were boxed on their sides) These are not \\&quot;solid\\&quot; solids, they are the softer type that squish through the holes at the top of the stick.  I thought I was getting the regular solid type.  They will work...</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t smell right... They smell chemically... Not like the others I have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice Deodorant for a long time and this is my favorite of their Red Zone line (pleasant, not overpowering smell, lasts all day &amp; through workouts.) I bought a 4-pack for $15 (without subscribing) and now, two months later, the price is $20! So this went from being a great online deal to something to add to my Wal-Mart grocery list.</li>
            <li> My son sweats heavy and due to various medications he takes, he stinks. This anti perspirant is the only one that keeps him dry and smelling good, and his shirts free from odor. That&#x27;s why I have four shipped to me every month.</li>
            <li> It works great! I put it on, and I don&#x27;t stink! I do not have much more to say on that matter.</li>
            <li> Great Scent, lasts most of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t do alot in the actual antiperspirant area, however it does manage to still smell great even when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sweaty, smelly, etc. on a busy day. This works so well! It does go on fairly white, so do not wear if you&#x27;re worried about your deodorant showing. And it runs out fairly quickly, in my experience. It&#x27;s easy to overuse it since you crank out the stuff, and as a guy I always overdo it. Still, it works well, and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and unfortunately they recently changed the scent to smell more like what teenage boys are after.  It used to be pleasantly mild, and now is chemically and over-cologney.  If you see any in the store with a clear cap, get em, because the new red-capped version is totally different and smells like the rest of what is on the market.</li>
            <li> Picture says it all.  Strangely 1 of the 4 was in perfect condition, making me question its age and if it is dried out...    [...]</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  I just wish they could ship to APO addresses.  Little picky I guess but it is the only thing keeping me from rating a \\&quot;5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> WAS the best (clear cap). Now completely disgusting after their &amp;#34;formula change&amp;#34; (red cap). Very disappointed that Old Spice seems to be simply chasing cheaper costs and the teen market (overpowering scent and ridiculous marketing). I&#x27;ve used this since it came out as Red Zone but will now be dropping all of the Old Spice products I use. If I can&#x27;t trust a company then how can I buy their products? They refuse to even give a reason for the change. Pathetic.</li>
            <li> My son is 11 and nothing was working it was that almost teen stink. Works wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Every stick I received was broken where the deodorant comes out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 15 years, maybe 20? As long as I can remember. For me it&#x27;s the perfect deodorant: effective, easy to use, smells good. Nuff said right?</li>
            <li> They changed the formulation recently. After your first application and putting the cap back on the deodorant, it starts forming hard flakes on the top. During your next application, you will delight in it scratching your underarm, and flakes falling down your body like it&#x27;s snowing. Gross and unpleasant. I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and it was my favorite. I thought I just encountered a bad batch, however every stick I get does this now. Change the formula back, guys. I&#x27;ll be moving onto another brand.</li>
            <li> From my husband:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great scent and works really well, plus you don&#x27;t have to use very much so it lasts a long time. Not much more you can ask for in an deodorant, amirite?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this deodorant. Even worse is that it&#x27;s not cheap. Amazon has it for a great price and even better if you get it on subscribe and save. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is really a strong antiperspirant to cover the smell, yes it works. However, all my work shirts and my t-shirts have yellow stains now which I never experienced before. I googled and found out that the Aluminum in this product causes yellow stains! No more for me! Back to my crystal deodorant stone/rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not experience yellow stains but I have. Therefore, to me it is one star. It ruined all my shirts.</li>
            <li> This deodorant used to be awesome but they recently changed the formula. It is easily the worst deodorant I have ever used now. Did Old Spice even do consumer testing before they released this GARBAGE!? Whoever decided to change this formula should be fired….I will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> I used to really like this deodorant and have used it for several years, but they recently changed the scent without warning and it&#x27;s become really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I think that i will not buy any others anti-perspirant than this. I buy the pack of 4 and i tell you this are really good.</li>
            <li> Works well for me and love the scent.  This came as a four pack and love the convenience of not needing to go to the grocery store to pick it up.  Helps to have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s deodorant Ok?  I use this to avoid smelling like a homeless person. This seems to help in my relationship.  Since they come in packages of 5 I always seem to have some.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the third time I have ordered this deodorant in this size package. It&#x27;s excellent!  Geo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it effective in reducing sweat.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that keeps down the body smell.</li>
            <li> Its dispensed as a thin, wet white gel from holes as you turn the knob. Goes on fairly invisible and doesn&#x27;t cake. Its not super strong smelling and does a decent job of preventing sweat. The white antiperspirant stick they make clogs your pours up better but cakes and flakes when you lather it on. I like to use a light base coat of the latter and then apply this product for more protection. People tell me it smells like I&#x27;m wearing a bit of cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband and I (yep, no frilly floral deodorants for this chick) have both used this deodorant for at least 5 years.  The &amp;#34;pure sport&amp;#34; is fairly unisex, and does a great job for both of us in controlling odor and sweat.  We do use different amounts - he loads it on (2-3 clicks per arm) and I use 1 click.  Love that it&#x27;s a soft solid - I prefer a more liquid product but I hate aerosols and gels take too long to dry.  Took off one star because I think they have changed the formula recently - the old one had a clear cap and wasn&#x27;t as strong smelling.  The new red-capped version is too strong IMO.  Will keep using it till I can find something better though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat anymore, it&#x27;s kind of alarming</li>
            <li> As someone who suffer from a intense perspiration under the arm pit, this is by far the best solution that I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I have tried almost everything, incluiding very strong products such as Odaban and others anti perspirants, but no one beats Old Spice Sweat Defense.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and I got a good deal with Subscribe and Save, so that&#x27;s enough for 5 stars for me!</li>
            <li> No matter what I do this deodorant always stains my shirts. I sometimes put it on 1 hour before I put a shirt on so that it drys but it still stains them. I don&#x27;t care that is stains the inside but when i put a shirt on I shouldn&#x27;t  have to worry about it marking the outside.</li>
            <li> This is about the best antiperspirant you can get without a prescription. At very nearly prescription strength (19% vs 20% gly prescription), this is the real deal and much cheaper and easier to obtain in comparison. This deodorant basically changed my life, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One type for use which I no longer use myself but did for about a year when I first started using this. This is a process I learned somewhere for use of prescription deodorant for users who have extreme sweat problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Take a shower before going to bed rather than in the morning&lt;br /&gt;2) Completely dry off your armpits before applying the deodorant (very, very important!) -- this should be air dry, not just towel dry. They must be absolutely bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;3) Assuming the stick has already been &amp;#34;started&amp;#34;, click the wheel three times (no more!) for each armpit&lt;br /&gt;4) Rub into the armpit until the solid has turned _completely_ transparent&lt;br /&gt;5) Allow your armpits to air dry again. (also very important)&lt;br /&gt;6) Sleep in a cold bedroom if you can to prevent yourself from sweating again&lt;br /&gt;7) Apply only one or two clicks of antiperspirant when dressing in the morning (don&#x27;t take another shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After awhile you should be able to eliminate steps and switch back to morning showers (at least based on my experience). The key is to try the process completely from top to bottom for at least a week. It&#x27;s important that you are aware of your own body and how it responds to heat, moisture, etc. and how it interacts with the antiperspirant and this takes time and focus to determine.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product in October and with happy with the results. But over time (It&#x27;s now March), this white residue builds up on the shirts. I&#x27;ve scrubbed them but can&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li> First of all: Don&#x27;t Buy This or any of the new deodorants from Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: This specific version of the deodorant has never functioned properly for me, and furthermore, evidences an extreme lack of respect on the part of Old Spice in regard to its customers and their sweat-prevention habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve been an Old Spice customer for as long as I&#x27;ve been regularly producing arm-pit sweat. I remember being about 12-years-old, walking into my childhood bedroom, and finding a passive-aggressively-placed stick of Old Spice deodorant sitting on my bed, lovingly placed there by my mother. Since that day, I had been the perfect &amp;#34;Zombie Consumer&amp;#34; for Old Spice: Every time I was near the end of a tube of deodorant, I would walk into the super-market, walk directly to the hygiene section (making sure I didn&#x27;t ever allow my curious gaze to wander across the &amp;#34;feminine hygiene products&amp;#34; for more than an acceptable amount of time), and pick-up the first stick of Old Spice deodorant I saw. I wouldn&#x27;t even browse the other brands—why should I have? I was happy with what I was purchasing, and to be honest, the Old Spice marketing campaign had had its desired effect on my pubescent brain. I actually believed (to some degree) that wearing the scents offered by Old Spice would net me more attention from females and make me more of a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no dummy. I understand (logically) how little sense it makes to believe such things, but you have to understand that I had no motivation or impetus to change the (somewhat-silly) beliefs that had been instilled in my at-the-time-pubescent brain. Imagine if you could still believe part-of the Santa Claus story all the way into adulthood, say, that there exists somewhere a man who selflessly gives children gifts. That would feel good, right? Just a little magic in the world—not too much. That&#x27;s what my relationship with Old Spice Deodorant was until about three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was preparing to leave my mid-western hometown for a six-month study-abroad in Germany, and had made a list of the toiletries that I would need to bring with me. I had heard that Germany had a lot of Vegan/Vegetarian folk, and remembered that I had once met a Vegan at a folk-dance in Chicago who told me that Deodorant was evil for some reason that had to do with Iron or something, so I wanted to make sure that I brought enough American Deodorant with me for six-months, just in-case German super-markets didn’t have normal Deodorant with Iron or whatever. (Protip: They do.) So I went to my local super-market and stocked-up with four tubes of my old-classic: Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am here in Germany, let me tell you, this bulk-Deodorant purchase have been the biggest mistake of my life. Do you know what it’s like to be sitting in a room full of cute foreign-girls, trying to impress them with your ability to correctly spell the word „Siebenhundertsiebenundsiebzigtausendsiebzig“, and all-the-while to feel little droplets of sweat form in your arm-pits and then slowly (I mean REALLY slowly, these fellas drag it out) drip down your sides? Because I do, and let me tell you, it’s „voll peinlich.“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed this sweat-drop phenomenon about a week after arriving in Germany and beginning to use this new deodorant. For the first two days, I didn’t really think much of it, and blamed it on the new Euro-Style shirts I was wearing. „Maybe Europeans have slightly different body shapes, and the way the fabric falls across my flank allows these occasional drops to fall,“ is what I thought. But after a few more days, wearing a few of my trusty America shirts, and still noticing the sweat-drops, I knew something was up. So I texted my friend Chris and asked him if he had ever experienced such a thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;„Me: Dude, about four or five times a day, I feel these large sweat bubbles pileup in my arm-pit, and they fall onto my flank, and it feels really weird. That ever happen to you?&lt;br /&gt;Chris: Are you using anti-perspirant?&lt;br /&gt;Me: Yeah, I’m using this Old Spice. It says „Sweat Defense“ right on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Chris: Wait, is it a creamy white stick that comes out of the pores on the top of the Deodorant tube?&lt;br /&gt;Me: Yeah, that’s the one.&lt;br /&gt;Chris: Lol. Alec and I both used that, and had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Oh man, what did you do?&lt;br /&gt;Chris: I got new Deo, dude.“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain to you what Chris means when he says „a creamy white stick that comes out of the pores.“ If you’ve ever used a men’s Deodorant before, you’re probably familiar with the dispensation method. But just in case you aren’t, here is the basic idea of how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the tube, there rests a stick of the chemically stuff (with Iron, I guess) which is actually the stuff you want to rub on your arm-pit. The tube is there so that you have something to hold while rubbing the chemically stuff on your skin. When you rub this stuff on your arm-pit, it wears down the stick of chemically stuff, until it no longer sticks-out of the tube, and can’t reach your skin. So then you twist a little knob at the bottom of the tube, which then causes a platform to raise, on which the chemically stuff stick sits, thereby allowing more of the chemically stuff to stick-out-of the tube, and therefore reach your arm-pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same basic idea applies to this product, but instead of just allowing the chemically stuff stick to stick out of the tube, it is first filtered through a series of porous holes. To visualize this, think back to those PlayDough Kitchen Play-sets that had the spaghetti-makers. Remember how you could take the PlayDough and shove it through the little holes in order to create dozens of spaghetti-noodle-looking strands of PlayDough (and then make your little-cousin eat it)? That’s basically how this works. Every time you turn the little knob, approximately twelve dozen (or „a gross“ if you are British or whatever) tiny strands of chemically Deodorant stuff stick out of the tube, waiting to be smeared on your arm-pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this system is HORRIBLE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, every-single-time I want to put Deodorant on, I have to turn the stupid little knob, because the process of rubbing the tube on my arm-pit completely removes all of the chemically Deodorant stuff strands sitting on the surface of the porous tube-filter. I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION. With traditional Deodorant application systems, I would turn the knob on-average once per week, maybe twice if it was the week of January 1 and I was still going to the gym at mid-day and needed to freshen up for the evening. Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much. And for what? I never seem to get the correct amount to apply to my under-arms, and thus, have been experiencing this sweat-drop problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know why they added this little porous hole filter, so I googled „Old Spice porous hole filter“ and found this explanation: „Product dispenses through holes for ideal application amount.“ Hold up. You are telling me that Old Spice, a product which is supposed to increase the manliness of (or the female impression of the manliness of) its user, is putting little tiny porous holes on the top of the Deodorant tube in order to create the „ideal application amount“? To me, that doesn’t sound like something a „man“ needs, but rather something that a „child“ needs. What does it mean that Old Spice wants to tell me how much chemically Deodorant stuff I need to apply to my arm-pits? Disrespect, that’s what it means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I’m not coming here saying I could do better. If you sat me down and told me to make a better Deodorant, I couldn’t do it. I wouldn’t even know where to begin building the chemically Deodorant stuff inside the tube (other than Iron, I guess). But if I could sit-down right now with someone at Old Spice, I would say this: „Treat your customers the way you want them to feel: like MEN.“ I would say to remove this ridiculous porous tube filter non-sense, and get back to doing what Old Spice does best: Convincing pubescent boys that they are going to attract more girls by wearing a specific kind of Deodorant (Old Spice), and thereby creating life-long customers. And at the same time, as these boys are being told they are becoming men, ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO BECOME MEN by giving them the freedom to decide their own application amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this changes, however, I will not be using Old Spice Deodorant anymore, and neither should you. Do you really want to use a Deodorant that promises to make you a man, but at the same time treats you like a child? Think about it.ime you turn the little knob, approximately twelve dozen (or „a gross“ if you are British or whatever) tiny strands of chemically Deodorant stuff stick out of the tube, waiting to be smeared on your arm-pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this system is HORRIBLE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, every-single-time I want to put Deodorant on, I have to turn the stupid little knob, because the process of rubbing the tube on my arm-pit completely removes all of the chemically Deodorant stuff strands sitting on the surface of the porous tube-filter. I, like most people who buy Deodorant, have TWO arm-pits, which means that I have to turn the little knob TWICE in a single Deodorant SESSION. With traditional Deodorant application systems, I would turn the knob on-average once per week, maybe twice if it was the week of January 1 and I was still going to the gym at mid-day and needed to freshen up for the evening. Absolutely nonsense that I need to turn this little knob so much. And for what?

            <li> New scent and it is awful, please go back to the original so you don&#x27;t lose a loyal customer! New smell is overpowering and has a cologne type smell to it.</li>
            <li> I went through a lot of deodorants before finding this gem.  The scent exudes manliness.  Sometimes I have to fight my wife off of me just so I can get out the door and go to work...we do have children to support!  I&#x27;ve found that the stick type deodorants leave a pretty thick residue that gets on the clothes easy.  The clear gel types take awhile to dry and really stain the heck out of clothes.  This powder application is great.  You don&#x27;t need too much of it.  It goes on easy and dries quickly.  Just beware of how the masculinity will ooze from you...it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant and when I forgot to purchase it recently I had to rely on Amazon to get it to me quickly. Not sure if it was Amazon or shipping but I ordered a 4 pack and one of them arrived broken. The other three were fine and I&#x27;ve already used at least one of them.</li>
            <li> excellent product works wonders</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an effective antiperspirant and/or deodorant, but alas this is not that product.  It feels like it controls perspiration, but it seems to fall short on the deodorant side.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on hunting for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> As expected. Very fast delivery and fair price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my bf will use, we have a monthly shipping of the stuff, bonus it smells really good on him</li>
            <li> My pits smell beautiful now. I recently switched to Old Spice from Gillette about a year back, and I&#x27;m super happy I did. My pits aren&#x27;t filled with paste anymore.</li>
            <li> Sparticus Would Have Worn It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh man, just think of it! Talc and herbs and Old Spice! Okay, since it&#x27;s Old Spice maybe I should be thinking of pirates of the Caribbean but still, the days before good de-odering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and the price but I like it showing up at my door even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve started doing this with many products I simply write out fewer lists and make fewer trips to stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aye matey!</li>
            <li> Been using this deodorant now since the 10th grade &amp; never had any issues of sweat or smell..at leas i hope not lol</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, all-year.  No irritations and get absorbed well into the skin, does not smudge clothing at all.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Needed this product, a slight savings buying online.  It is Nice to have a stock and not wait for sales.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think sweat defense is fair to say.  Actual result for me was similar to most other AP&#x27;s.  Hesitant about buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this soft solid form of antiperspirant.  So far, I&#x27;ve found no one else who makes anything similar.  Gels are always wet and gooey, while solids don&#x27;t cover properly and often crumble.  The soft solid glides on smooth and dry and covers the underarm area completely.  Excellent product.  I use nothing else.</li>
            <li> normally i sweet a lot, and i have tried a bunch of different deodorants, this was definitely the one that worked for me, plus it doesnt stain my clothes either</li>
            <li> I thought I got a good deal on these, but they all have a sticky residue on top. When my husband applies his deodorant, it gets all matted up and sticky and gross. I&#x27;ve cleaned the top with soapy water, but every time he rolls more up, more sticky stuff comes out with the deodorant. He&#x27;s been wearing this stuff for 10 years and has never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I find that my liquid gold works just as well, and is a bit cheaper. Seriously. Is there an ingredient in this product only harvested on the Moon? Do we have to send little men on big rockets to the sky to retrieve more, when the world&#x27;s armpits start sweating again? Inst the fact that we&#x27;re putting questionable substances (so says the girl in the Moo-Moo down the streets that always smells like patchouli and wildly overgrown armpit sweat) under our arms, where there is always skin-to-questionable-substances-to-skin contact, all day worth a break in price?&lt;br /&gt;I do like it, but little ol&#x27; me will just do with the Other Leading Brands, set-that-pit-on-fire, alcohol based &amp;#34;sporty scent&amp;#34; deodorant. They&#x27;re cheaper and fail just as routinely as &amp;#34;The Grey Poupon&amp;#34; of sweat-absorbing-questionable-substances. Besides, you have to toss these things before they run out mid-stroke. not only does that plastic screen get hot, quick, each little dispenser pore grabs a hair and yells, &amp;#34;Hang on!&amp;#34; in a frequency only your dog can hear. I toss mine at 4/5th.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant that last all day.  It works and has a really good fragrance, you get four in a pack at a very good price.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 10 years in the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent and it was awesome. Recently they changed the smell of this whole line and now it is just nauseating. It smells a lot like highschoolers now - no offense to anyone. I&#x27;ve written Old Spice and they have confirmed the smell change and also the fact that they will not be bringing back the original smells. They also advised me to not use any remaining sticks that I may have of the original smell - seems kinda odd and gets me somewhat worried that they realized something bad about their original smell product.  Needless to say I will probably be moving on to a different deodorant. It was such a great 10+ year product. :(</li>
            <li> So dissapointed. P&amp;G have changed the scent....boooo!</li>
            <li> Hubby really smells delicious with this Old Spice...yummy.  Makes me want to cuddle him...need I say more!</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop sweat and smell good. This does both. This is a great product. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, it has a fresh smell that my wife just can&#x27;t get enough of. My only complaint would be that it seems like there is not very much deodorant on the inside. I go through these things faster than I have any other deodorants I used in the past. Regardless, it is still my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Like my title says, I&#x27;m a sweater.  Most gels and clear products don&#x27;t work.  Solids are hit or miss usually.  No matter what I&#x27;ve used in the past, I always had pit stains even with an undershirt.  The other day I was talking with some friends and I leaned back and put my hands behind my head and then got all nervous realizing that I always have sweaty underarms - took a look and all was clear.  I then realized that since I switched to these Old Spice joints, I haven&#x27;t seen wet underarms. I&#x27;ve had multiple women tell me they like my cologne even though I&#x27;m only wearing this stuff.  My girl even comments how my laundry doesn&#x27;t reek anymore when she&#x27;s doing the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put on too much at first - get a feel for how much you need.  Every now and then my pits itch, but always dry and smelling nice is worth it.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I trust!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and used Mitchum for the longest time as it was supposed to be the strongest - but recently the Mitchum stuff got really watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switched over to this Sweat Defense and it keeps me drier than anything I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of deodorant for a couple of years.  The one thing I wish they still had was the &#x27;Showtime&#x27; scent, my fiance really loved that scent more than what is out there now.  This scent is good but isn&#x27;t as good as &#x27;Showtime.&amp;#34;  I totally recommend soft-solids for others.</li>
            <li> Good sweat protection as the name would suggest. I sweat a bit more than average and since switching from speedstick 24/7 I&#x27;m always dry after getting home from work. In addition, my wife likes the smell of it, so that&#x27;s a big plus.</li>
            <li> I never have BO. I don&#x27;t know if I can credit to using this deodorant for years, but it&#x27;s either that or genes. And I naturally sweat a lot. So, I think this product works pretty well. I still sweat but I don&#x27;t think that will go away from anything over the counter.</li>
            <li> My regular deodorant, well priced and to my door.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My husband goes though deodorant like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I like how it come in a pack and we only have to order ever several months.</li>
            <li> simply the best non-prescription strength deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> good price, but have to apply a lot for adequate protection as compared to gillette advanced</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping.  Recommended to all that prefer Old Spice as their deodorant.  Great price per unit.</li>
            <li> This deoderant is great as an antiperspirant, but it leaves dark marks on clothing that do not go away until washed. This is very inconvenient. If you don&#x27;t wear an undershirt, you&#x27;re basically screwed.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount you get. Love the subscribe and save and having more show up when you are just about to run out.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper then I can find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for many years. If it&#x27;s dangerous, I have whatever it&#x27;s going to give me... but it&#x27;s worth it, b/c I smell amazing all day long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years, but it can be expensive.  I&#x27;ve found its so much better to buy in bulk.  I now have this setup through Subscribe and Save to get them even cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems to last a really long time. aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa..  aaa.  aaa.  aaa. a aa  a</li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;soft solid&amp;#34; for years and am finding it harder and harder to locate in stores.  Glad I am able to obtain it here though.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant &amp; deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find at this price point.  I have tried 10+ different one over the years and have now been using Old Spice Red Zone for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Works great for my guys.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I have found that keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> Sweat defense that last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those rare people that never sweats under their arms.  But unfortunately I sweat just about everywhere else.  Especially my forehead and face on really hot days.  When I am going to something formal in hot weather that I can&#x27;t avoid, I use Sweat Block that is a true miracle cure for people like me as far as I am concerned, and available here on Amazon as well.  ( I have a complete review of it at its Amazon site).  But since Sweat Block is pretty costly to use all the time, I have learned to supplement it with this stuff for every day use and more casual affairs.  I have used some sort of Old Spice deodorant for years, and when I found this stuff I tried it on my forehead on the first really hot day and it worked very well.  It didn&#x27;t stop the sweating completely, but it was much better than dripping and being totally embarrassed at times like I was before.  It especially good at getting me through those moments when its not really all that hot, but I usually am sweating bullets anyway.  I just turn the dial till some of the lotion is exposed, then I gather it up with my fingers and spread it over my forehead and parts of my face. (A little goes a long ways, use sparingly).  It has never irritated me, and it even smells nice and is comfortable to wear.  (A little wet when first applied just like under your arms, but it dries fast and you get used it fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this stuff does work very wll under your arms judging by the vast amounts of positive reviews here.  But if you also sweat on your head and face like I do and wish to stem some of the flow, I recommend you give this a try. (The container says its for underarm use only, as does Sweat Block.  Guess they don&#x27;t want to to get into the problems of recommending it anywhere else. I have never had any problem with this, or Sweat Block).  Give it a try.  The worst that can happen in my opinion is you will just keep wiping your brow as you always do, and you can still use it under your arms.. : )rms.. : )</li>
            <li> This has become become my go to antiperspirant/deoderant. My wife loves the pure sport scent more than any other while i just like that it works. I trust the old spice sweat defense over anything else i&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m still willing to try something new but this is tried and trusted and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is weird, but I&#x27;ve had women hug me, then plant their nose in my pit and breath deep...  This is my antiperspirant of choice.  Keeps me dry and stink-free all day and I sweat a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is solid, but is pushed through small holes in a plastic screen, so it&#x27;s not like the old push-pop style block of solid deoderant.  Goes on like a gel, but without that wet sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Reduces the perspiration and keeps the odor associated with perspiration away. Feels and smells great. It will dry and leave removable stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I have used Old spice deodorant for M A N Y  years and any guy out there that has knows what a super product it is.  I actually picked this Old Spice sweat defense up by mistake got it home and was about to use it when i said oh no, well i had to and WOW-WE I am glad I did. first of all if you have any heat rash or dryness under your arm this is the Best product you can buy; there is something in it that makes you more at ease, and plus the product is not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes and it washes out easily...Very very good I thin you or your man would be very happy to use it.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is some of the strongest, manliest smelling deodorant out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different deodorants on the market, and I sweat a lot, and this has held up time and time again. Old Spice rocks for those that don&#x27;t want to smell like a prepubescent teen.</li>
            <li> I put this one became even more of a man.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, keeps me so fresh and so clean..</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross; it smears so easy, and the worst part when you sweat you can feel the stuff dripping from your underarms under your shirt it feels weird and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the defense I was looking for, Didn&#x27;t keep me dry, thought since it&#x27;s called defense ii thought t would be more like the old school Ray Lewis ravens or Super Bowl Seahawks not the Jacksonville jaguars. Smells good though</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used this same brand and smell of years because I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything better.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 15 years best deodorant around.  Love the 4 pack I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it works.&lt;br /&gt;Holds back sweat and the smell. You still sweat but not as much and keeps the the odor at bay. At least for a good bit.&lt;br /&gt;If only more people who rode public transport would do the same along with washing up regularly.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the deodarant excatly as shown in picture with red cap but i was sent a different product with with white or grey cap you can see i think its not the one that i choose its absoultely not right</li>
            <li> I have been using the old spice sweat defense pure sport deodorant for a long time and have always enjoyed the scent. I noticed that my most recent purchase the scent wasn&#x27;t the same as it had always been. Instead of the usual \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent it was much more feminine smelling. I noticed the inactive ingredients changed so maybe that&#x27;s the reason it smells different.&lt;br /&gt;Old inactive ingredients:cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, tribehenin, fragrance, c18-36 acid triglyceride. New inactive ingredients: cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, synthetic wax, tribehenin, paraffin.</li>
            <li> The commercial made me buy this back in 2001. It was a guy wearing heavy dirt bike riding gear, while riding his quad on hot sand dune hills... Very sweaty commercial with red, orange, and brown colors, almost made me want to sweat while watching that commercial.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the guy looked at the camera and said... \\&quot;The deodorant for guys that truly sweat, it gets the job done that no other deodorant would\\&quot; then I said \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; I proceeded to Walmart and bought one... It&#x27;s been more than 10years, and I still buy them at Walmart in bulk. I never thought armpits could smile, until I decided to start wearing this deodorant. They are now smiling. :-D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since Tony Steward originally started endorsing it back in the early 2000&#x27;s.  The only downside is that I cannot use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Good price on a multi-pack</li>
            <li> I also use the &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scented shower gel, and the two scents do not match. I prefer the shower gel&#x27;s &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; scent, but the this one isn&#x27;t bad either. I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot, so I usually just apply it before I go to the gym. It works great and keeps a long lasting scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Order a set. None of these actually worked. Will be returning them.</li>
            <li> Have used for 15 years and will continue to use as long as it&#x27;s around. Smells great, lasts all day and does not stain my shirts (despite what some say on here). I&#x27;ve tried many others before this and in recent years tried others and I always come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products and so far, this is the only one I could find that works for me! I was hesitant about the gel-like liquid, and have always disliked the gel deodorants, but this one lasts a full 24 hours for me and is now the only one I will ever buy.  The smell of all the Old Spice Sweat Defense products smells very similar to me, but it keeps me from smelling bad, so I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love how this type (white) never gives me a rash as opposed to the clear or gel version. I&#x27;ll be using this product for as long as its available</li>
            <li> As i expected it and more, perhaps one of the best products for this sensitive area of the human body.</li>
            <li> smells great&lt;br /&gt;does the job in terms of keeping you dry&lt;br /&gt;fairly priced&lt;br /&gt;not much more needed out of a deodorant</li>
    </ol>
