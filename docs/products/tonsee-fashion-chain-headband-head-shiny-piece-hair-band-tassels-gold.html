    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wore it all of two times and it broke</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It took over a month to get delivered but I was actually ok with that. The problem was, it was broke when I opened it! Its very cheap and I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap and not what I ordered</li>
            <li> They are absolutely beautiful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to write. My younger sister, LOVED it. I had it shipped to her home. Now her selfies look even more greater, with her new Chain Headband. One of my best orders yet.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on and looks slightly cheap once you finally figure out how to wear it. Save your money and get something that looks and performs better. Looks nothing like the picture!</li>
            <li> It Isn&#x27;t Big As Shown On The picture But I Still Love It</li>
            <li> I do not know why this has any bad reviews, I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always told people you can find ANYTHING on amazon, and when I saw the chain head bands I knew it was true. A cross between a medieval look and 60&#x27;s hippy chic, it&#x27;s definitely a must have for the eclectic dresser.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect for such an inexpensive item, whether it would look cheap or be easily broken. But I have been very happy with both the looks and durability of the hair ornament. Due to hair loss, I wear a lot of scarfs and wigs, and I have found that it can work equally well with either. Some reviews complain of it taking a long time to ship, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I have ordered many things from overseas and was satisfied with the time it took to arrive. So, all in all, I am very happy with [[ASIN:B00NN1PJHW Suppion Fashion Chain Headband Head Shiny Piece Hair Band Tassels Gold]]  and am looking forward to purchasing a different one soon!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it looks like . Depending on hair style it may not fit (I wear braids)</li>
            <li> Broke As soon as I put it on my head</li>
            <li> It came broken beyond repair and took forever to get here. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It was broke upon receipt!</li>
            <li> Looks a bit smaller than the picture but still very gorgeous !</li>
            <li> Really fashionable. My daughter love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> I love wearing this! It fits great and looks beautiful. Arrived in perfect condition and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>

            <li> not what i expected ..</li>
            <li> good but not as cute as it seem</li>

            <li> Too big. Falls off the head hair</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture.  It is tarnished metal the color has come off. It looks so cheap. I will not be able to wear it.</li>
