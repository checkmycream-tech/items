            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Great feeling when brushing.</li>
            <li>The stimulant pulsation mode is great on your gums.</li>
            <li>good product and great price</li>
            <li>This product has great promise - finally a good alternative to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>That can also be a good thing because it forces you to brush the correct way for a sonic brush.</li>
            <li>I cannot in good faith recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li>has good vibration and brushes well.  </li>
            <li>I always get good news during dentist visit.</li>
            <li>It may be good for a shoes brush.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with my toothbrush.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>Battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is absolutely one of the best purchases that I have ever made.  </li>
            <li>nice brush, but you sometime turn it off by accident ( on &amp; off button in the way )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to have.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush always makes my teeth feel dentist clean</li>
            <li>good price, great pulse, and looks really sleek.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush! :)</li>
            <li>I liked my Oral B much better</li>
            <li>great buy, much better than higher priced models</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>have been using it now for 3 months and love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than my sonicare did.</li>
            <li>I wrote them a month ago hoping they would suggest a solution, because we Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>In all I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast vibrating head cleaned teeth much better than any manual brush and felt really good on the gums.</li>
            <li>With this issue, it becomes nearly unusable - any pulling force will yank the brush head off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very happy with the toothbrush itself and the customer service I received.</li>
            <li>The movement of the brush is too strong on all the speeds.</li>
            <li>BUT UPDATE see below: UPDATE: 2 of the 3 toothbrushes I purchased are still fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine maybe issue with the life of heads</li>
            <li>Sonic Edge is powerful and looks great in our new spa bathroom.</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and light weight.</li>
            <li>had always thought I wanted a round brush as opposed to oval shaped, but this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It seems to be charging (judging from the light indicators) but not working at all.</li>
            <li>Have not determined if the name-brand heads will fit.</li>
            <li>why does the light flashes all the time?</li>
            <li>Is lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The tooth brush is OK, but it often turns off while in use and is not as strong as a real sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended that I start using an ultra sonic toothbrush to help clean my gums.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer it&#x27;s feel in my hand and ability to clean after using Sonicare for way too many years.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter than the name brand sonic tooth brush, but don&#x27;t let that fool you it works even better.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, more powerful than prior ones, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>First full charge lasted for three months at 2 uses per day.</li>
            <li>Soft brush heads that are easy to replace and three brush modes.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush it works well</li>
            <li>The first toothbrush I received would not charge.  </li>
            <li>Fast arrival,great product!</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like having to hit the button 3 times in order to shut it off every time (as it cycles through all the settings till &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>The brushing effect is exactly the same as Sonicare, leaves teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>This one is the most elegant, slim and least intrusive of them all.</li>
            <li>This brush is everything the positive reviews indicated and more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was delivered within a few days, and I am very pleased it.  </li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the flashing blue light on the front of the unit.  </li>
            <li>Teeth were almost plaque free during my last cleaning.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has been great; The company in the past has been very responsive to a concern that now continues to surface that the toothbrush heads do not stay on - after a short period of use, the begin to ride up the post on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I sent the seller an e-mail 10 days ago and have left messages on their toll-free line every few days asking for their help because I know the product is good, just this one gave up way too soon.  </li>
            <li>Not as high quality as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>There are four distinct divisions in the timing which are invaluable for changing from one section of your teeth to the next.</li>
            <li>Hope the new one gives me longer use than this one.  </li>
            <li>Other family members are also happy with theirs bought at the same time also previous Sonicare users.  </li>
            <li>I did not receive a response - until one week later when a brand new brush arrived in the mail, no questions asked!!</li>
            <li>Bought for my mom (83yrs old)</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the case with my old Sonic.  </li>
            <li>Also, my gums never bled with my old Sonic, whereas my gums started bleeding with this one -</li>
            <li>First head broke early, though - clear insert at bottom of head broke loose, had to pitch it.</li>
            <li>If you are not familiar with sonic tooth brushes do not start at full strength.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &#x27;&#x27;vibrations&amp;#34; are strong and it is not comfortable if your teeth touches the back of the brush, but you just learn to avoid this happening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, I have hit my teeth a couple of times and it taught me to be a little more careful.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, so far works well.</li>
            <li>I do like it, it came with several replacement heads and seems to be very similar to my old sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I plugged in my toothbrush to charge and per the instructions, it would take at least 24 hours for full charge.  </li>
            <li>I would say the downside is that it doesn&#x27;t sit very well on it&#x27;s charger and any little touch will knock it off.  </li>

            <li> I would say the downside is that it doesn&#x27;t sit very well on it&#x27;s charger and any little touch will knock it off.  </li>
            <li> Vibration is strong and if its hard on you still have the versatility to go one down.</li>
            <li> Other electric toothbrushes are so loud in comparison.</li>
            <li> and the charge last for a long time</li>
            <li> The only draw back is if you hurry your brushing and touch the back of the tooth brush to other teeth</li>
            <li> The others did not last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> It has one serious flaw: The brush heads do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> However, after about six weeks of use, its charging light suddenly failed to illuminate, and a very few days later, the brush would run for only a couple of seconds at a time before turning itself off.  </li>
            <li> had rough tarter formation on the inner side of my lower front teeth and that is totally gone with just a few days brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps charge long time as would be expected with lithium ion battery(s).  </li>
            <li> I am figuring out how to brush without this happening but the experience is not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is the head is a little small.</li>
            <li> Unable to really even review because the item didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> My Fiance purchased a pair of these as christmas gifts for each other.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you don&#x27;t want to hit the plastic part of the brush head to your teeth</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I relied on previous reviews when ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> I had Acteh electric toothbrush for less than 2 months and battery is no longer holding up, even after a week of charging.</li>
            <li> the brush took a little time to get accustomed to...</li>
            <li> Took a few days of using.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since I got it and</li>
            <li> The brush cells are firm and durable not like the replacements you buy in stores for the Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It went to my disabled sister who has a hard time brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> The Phillips ones I have purchased in the past lasted one year.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way toooooooooo hard on my gums, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Paying over $60 for an item that fails completely after less than two month&#x27;s use is highly annoying to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Not a good toothbrush</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth and have an recession, this is a bad choice!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this but it is a little violent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my toothbrush never charged.  </li>
            <li> Call it what you like, but this was a fail.</li>
            <li> The button is on the wrong place.</li>
            <li> I read a negative review that complained about hitting their teeth with the brush and how awful it was.</li>
            <li> Bad egg - lemon- rotten apple.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I plugged in my toothbrush to charge and per the instructions, it would take at least 24 hours for full charge.  Unfortunately, my toothbrush never charged.  After 3 days of it being plugged in and not working, I had to return.  Unable to really even review because the item didn&#x27;t work!  Bad egg - lemon- rotten apple.  Call it what you like, but this was a fail.</li>
            <li> Took a few days of using. It changed my way of brushing teeth. Timer on brushing, and feeling after.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it..it has the different settings..it&#x27;s lightweight. .and it comes with two brush heads..have been using it now for 3 months and love it.</li>
            <li> the brush took a little time to get accustomed to... it does a wonderful job cleaning</li>
            <li> Works better than my sonicare did. Not as clunky either</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this tooth brush. I have used sonic care for years. Sonic Edge is powerful and looks great in our new spa bathroom. It is much lighter than the name brand sonic tooth brush, but don&#x27;t let that fool you it works even better. If you are not familiar with sonic tooth brushes do not start at full strength. The only draw back is if you hurry your brushing and touch the back of the tooth brush to other teeth it chatters them. That can also be a good thing because it forces you to brush the correct way for a sonic brush. I bought it for the looks, and find that I treasure it for it&#x27;s excellant performance</li>
            <li> great buy, much better than higher priced models</li>
            <li> good price, great pulse, and looks really sleek.  EDIT: Excellent customer service. My Fiance purchased a pair of these as christmas gifts for each other. One stopped working. I contacted Acteh via their website, which claims a 1 year warranty for all products purchased through Acteh&#x27;s online store. I inquired if the one year warranty applied to a product i purchased from here. I did not receive a response - until one week later when a brand new brush arrived in the mail, no questions asked!!</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this toothbrush. It is cheap and light weight. The movement of the brush is too strong on all the speeds. It is not worth the money. If you have sensitive teeth and have an recession, this is a bad choice!</li>
            <li> I relied on previous reviews when ordering this product.  This brush is everything the positive reviews indicated and more.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely one of the best purchases that I have ever made.  It truly does feel like a dental cleaning every time.&lt;br /&gt;I had rough tarter formation on the inner side of my lower front teeth and that is totally gone with just a few days brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;&#x27;vibrations&amp;#34; are strong and it is not comfortable if your teeth touches the back of the brush, but you just learn to avoid this happening.&lt;br /&gt;I had always thought I wanted a round brush as opposed to oval shaped, but this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush it works well and the charge last for a long time (ten days while I was on vacation)  I have used it everyday since I got it and the best feature is it shuts off after the 2 minute recommended brushing time no guess work involved.</li>
            <li> good product and great price</li>
            <li> My grandson loves it!!</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge a long time.  Not as high quality as I thought it would be.  I liked my Oral B much better</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was delivered within a few days, and I am very pleased it.  It  is lighter weight and smaller around so that it is easier to hold.</li>
            <li> The best of them all. This is the second one that I have bought. It went to my disabled sister who has a hard time brushing teeth. This one is the most elegant, slim and least intrusive of them all. And it does a great job to assist teeth hygiene.</li>
            <li> HAVE LOWERED MY EVALUATION, SEE POST EVALUATION BELOW: Keeps charge long time as would be expected with lithium ion battery(s).  Much prefer it&#x27;s feel in my hand and ability to clean after using Sonicare for way too many years.  Have had this Sonic Edge for about 2 months now and very happy.  Other family members are also happy with theirs bought at the same time also previous Sonicare users.  BUT UPDATE see below: UPDATE: 2 of the 3 toothbrushes I purchased are still fine. 1 of them stopped turning on after 7 months. It seems to be charging (judging from the light indicators) but not working at all. I sent the seller an e-mail 10 days ago and have left messages on their toll-free line every few days asking for their help because I know the product is good, just this one gave up way too soon.  They have not replied to any of my calls or e-mail.  I called Amazon and they are processing a refund, so I can buy another.  Hope the new one gives me longer use than this one.  POST EVALUATION: The toothbrush has been great; The company in the past has been very responsive to a concern that now continues to surface that the toothbrush heads do not stay on - after a short period of use, the begin to ride up the post on the toothbrush.  The company replaced the heads earlier, but these heads also do not stay on the toothbrush.  Maybe it&#x27;s the toothbrush.  I wrote them a month ago hoping they would suggest a solution, because we Love these toothbrushes.  Family has 3 and this is the only one that does this. No response yet in after waiting a month.</li>
            <li> Upon delivery, this brush worked beautifully. It&#x27;s fast vibrating head cleaned teeth much better than any manual brush and felt really good on the gums. Had I reviewed it then, I&#x27;d have given it five stars.  However, after about six weeks of use, its charging light suddenly failed to illuminate, and a very few days later, the brush would run for only a couple of seconds at a time before turning itself off.  Paying over $60 for an item that fails completely after less than two month&#x27;s use is highly annoying to say the least.  I cannot in good faith recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended that I start using an ultra sonic toothbrush to help clean my gums.  My teeth are noticably cleaner using this product.  I like that the unit keeps a charge for extended periods allowing me to keep the charging cradle in a drawer.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is OK, but it often turns off while in use and is not as strong as a real sonic toothbrush. In all I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th electric toothbrush.  So far so good.  The others did not last very long at all.  This one seems to work well and I like it.</li>
            <li> There are four distinct divisions in the timing which are invaluable for changing from one section of your teeth to the next.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  The bristles are way toooooooooo hard on my gums, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The button is on the wrong place. I an always accidentally pushing it.</li>
            <li> Very good alternative to sonic care. First head broke early, though - clear insert at bottom of head broke loose, had to pitch it. Have not determined if the name-brand heads will fit. First full charge lasted for three months at 2 uses per day.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom (83yrs old) and she loves it. Her teeth look great, I need to buy myself one!</li>
            <li> has good vibration and brushes well.  Only draw back is the head is a little small.</li>
            <li> Excellent electrical toothbrush for the price!!!</li>
            <li> nice brush, but you sometime turn it off by accident ( on &amp; off button in the way )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to have.  Works great.  Soft brush heads that are easy to replace and three brush modes.  Holds charge for a long time.  You should try this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this but it is a little violent. You can not move it around your mouth as you would a regular toothbrush or the back of the brush head will hit your teeth and jar your head. I am figuring out how to brush without this happening but the experience is not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The first toothbrush I received would not charge.  I contacted the company and they promptly sent a replacement, which I am very happy with.  I have been a sonicare user since they came out but mine died so I decided to try something different.  I did some research, watched some videos, and decided to try this one.  I do like it, it came with several replacement heads and seems to be very similar to my old sonicare.  I would say the downside is that it doesn&#x27;t sit very well on it&#x27;s charger and any little touch will knock it off.  Other than that I am very happy with the toothbrush itself and the customer service I received.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I read a negative review that complained about hitting their teeth with the brush and how awful it was. Well, I have hit my teeth a couple of times and it taught me to be a little more careful.  It wasn&#x27;t that big of deal!  Best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works fine maybe issue with the life of heads</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t spin. It only viberates. Not a good toothbrush</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, so far works well.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival,great product!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, works awesome!!  Would have given 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the flashing blue light on the front of the unit.  It&#x27;s like having a police car in your bathroom all night :-(  I may have to take it off the base over night, it&#x27;s very annoying when you are trying to sleep!!</li>
            <li> why does the light flashes all the time?</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I love this toothbrush! :)</li>
            <li> Teeth were almost plaque free during my last cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product has great promise - finally a good alternative to Sonicare. It has one serious flaw: The brush heads do not stay on very well. If they fix this, it gets five stars. With this issue, it becomes nearly unusable - any pulling force will yank the brush head off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s great. Battery life is amazing. The brushing effect is exactly the same as Sonicare, leaves teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, more powerful than prior ones, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This item only lasted 6 months. The Phillips ones I have purchased in the past lasted one year. Could not register the warranty for it either. The website given with it no longer worked.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you don&#x27;t want to hit the plastic part of the brush head to your teeth - it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable.  This wasn&#x27;t the case with my old Sonic.  Also, my gums never bled with my old Sonic, whereas my gums started bleeding with this one - so now I have to choose the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; setting on this toothbrush.  I also don&#x27;t like having to hit the button 3 times in order to shut it off every time (as it cycles through all the settings till &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;).  All in all...I won&#x27;t return, but it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush always makes my teeth feel dentist clean</li>
            <li> Item works as advertised.  Great feeling when brushing.</li>
            <li> Very good product recommend to everyone who needs great dental care.I always get good news during dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and transaction!</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning!  My teeth feel as if I just came from the dentist. It&#x27;s very quiet too.  Other electric toothbrushes are so loud in comparison. The battery charge lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I had Acteh electric toothbrush for less than 2 months and battery is no longer holding up, even after a week of charging. Contacted Acteh via email and voicemail for a replacement. No response from Acteh since July 15th. It may be good for a shoes brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric brush. Is lightweight and comfortable. The brush cells are firm and durable not like the replacements you buy in stores for the Sonic toothbrushes. You can&#x27;t beat the low price. Vibration is strong and if its hard on you still have the versatility to go one down. The stimulant pulsation mode is great on your gums. Whoever uses these electric brushes will never ever tolerate the superficial cleaning of hand brushing. Go for it, your teeth will scream aaahh!!!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with his Sonic Edge Rechargeable Electronic Toothbrush. I was happy with the price!</li>
            <li> Perfect my dentist told me to get this and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
