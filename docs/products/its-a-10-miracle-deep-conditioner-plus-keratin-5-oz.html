            <li>and you will get good aspect</li>
            <li>Good investment.</li>
            <li>I give it a light rinse at best, then turn the water off and admire the buckets of gray water</li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>It is a good sized bottle that lasts a while if used once a week.</li>
            <li>(Unless I find a really good deal)</li>
            <li>There are some really good silicones out there - ones with the prefix PPG or PEG come to mind (neither of which are found in this product).&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is a good product, I recoment it</li>
            <li>This conditioner does a good job of moisturizing my hair, and i do not have any problems with tangles after washing my hair.  </li>

            <li>My friend ( who has gorgeous shiny hair) recommended this</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t have hair products that don&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner because it keeps my frizzy hair a bit under control, is not my fave, but for the price I think is a good deal..</li>
            <li>But I still gave it 5 stars because it works that good.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think its doing me any good.</li>
            <li>saying i needed it and this product had good reviews</li>
            <li>Product itself was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Sometimes just a good conditioner and leave-in spray or finishing oil will</li>
            <li>and my husband kept saying how good my hair smelled.</li>

            <li>I love this product ..</li>
            <li>I was better off using my $4 Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will be using more of this.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s just ok for me.</li>
            <li>just found out about using keratin more and anything with it in it has to be used sparingly.</li>
            <li>as it does an even better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this company makes paraben-free, sulfate-free products that also do not do animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I am on the fence as to if it makes my hair feel more straw like than with</li>
            <li>I get many complements on how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>There are many ingredients listed that cause skin irritation, and in some cases aggravating existing eczema problems.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and the effect it has on my hair</li>
            <li>BUT for those of you worried about increasing the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; of your hair....you will have to wash it more often.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one works.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but I prefer something that leaves my hair feeling more silky.  </li>
            <li>works better than what i used to get at the beauty salon...</li>
            <li>in LOVE with</li>
            <li>and it made it produce more oil...</li>

            <li>Dont be fooled, even though this is sold in the retail market many hairdressers use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>MORE SHININESS (NOT GREASY SHINY, LUSTER SHINY!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the keratin line of products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I believe the 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, 5 oz, would be great once I receive it!!!  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The course/dry spots on the top of my head were shiny and silky too.</li>
            <li>and i will never use any hair mask on my hair ever again unless its from Its a 10, just an overall AWESOME brand</li>
            <li>I will update this review if the condition of my hair changes after more use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a brush through my hair with no difficulty.</li>
            <li>i love how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I would more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have some allergies to chemicals and this one fits my ok list.  </li>
            <li>I put it on in the shower and put a shower cap on my hair just so that the products could penetrate more and the water won&#x27;t wash it out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally more like a tumbleweed.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews of It&#x27;s a 10 products for quite awhile, I finally decided to give them a try and soooooooo glad that I did!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have waist length hair too:)</li>
            <li>One of the best conditioners currently on the market.  </li>
            <li>If you have a water softener, even better for your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard before not to use keratin if you have healthy hair</li>
            <li>Would not recommend if you have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Until it grows out, there is nothing better that we have found.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it over, and over again.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I will for sure purchase</li>
            <li>but it looks better</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what it does, if anything, but i did notice more compliments about my hair and more women wanted to play with it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner, and I have never said that about a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, and it&#x27;s good...but not the best.</li>
            <li>a bit shinier, more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, so I think I can probably get 1, maybe 2, more treatments from a bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like to wear my hair straight, so thought the Keratin would be great.  </li>
            <li>All in all, for the price, I think there are better combo&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and its fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would use this again to keep my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner more.</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also very fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair so soft and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I gave you a great list of what I used for my bleached out breaking hair that is more normal now.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft and even if I don&#x27;t straighten it ( which I do do most days), it dries into beautiful relaxed curls and never gets frizzy at all EVEN ON RAINY DAYS -</li>
            <li>Works great- leaves you hair feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 makes my mother&#x27;s hair soft and beautiful...</li>
            <li>Uber worth it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this is my new go to hair treatment.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and allows me to curl it more easily.</li>
            <li>Repairs dry, damaged, colored hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li>the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard already, if you have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s best to &amp;#34;co-wash,&amp;#34; as they call it.</li>
            <li>conditioner was good, but not quite as good as the shampoo of the same set, but it does make hair smoother and</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes your hair so soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I like this more than that, but, it did a fine job at softening my hair and detangling it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay, nothing special, but also not awful.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, waist length fine hair, and this conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The scent, which I find deeply disagreeable to begin with, is incredibly cloying and overpowering.</li>
            <li>I just bought hair oil, that seems works better to keep hair shine and smooth</li>
            <li>After years of damaging my hair and trying countless products, my hair is finally healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>, It smells great and my hair is soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>It left me with an incredible amount of breakage that will take months to grow out.  </li>
            <li>When I use this conditioner it helps to smooth it out and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>silky smooth after use :)</li>
            <li>Wow i cant even tell you how great</li>
            <li>Really good product , it leaves your hair very silky.</li>
            <li>This product helped my hair so much to look good again.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this as I&#x27;ve witnessed the magic of keratin on my hair before.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging; the squeeze tube is easy to use.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT ( I use the miracle shampoo, miracle deep conditioner plus keratin, and the miracle leave-in conditioner)  :)))</li>
            <li>Adds volume to my hair and makes it easy to style</li>
            <li>Makes comb through really easy and leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a great deep conditioner since I love the leave-in treatment..</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the little fly aways on the top of my head after I used this which was nice.</li>
            <li>Have fine hair that gets oily easily.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very good, I think, for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>love it and it came quickly</li>
            <li>The seller was quick too!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found it on Amazon for $16!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my quick shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li>In the morning, rinse hair and your hair will be super soft with great smell.</li>
            <li>perfect, but little amount</li>
            <li>this deep conditioner is good for you, whereas if your hair is in good condition but very dry the miracle mask is a good choice for you.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have tried using the Leave-In Potion when using another conditioner, and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same great smooth and shiny effect.</li>
            <li>amazing I really love how soft and shinny my hair turned out.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair so I can tell a huge difference with this one.</li>
            <li>but I did see a huge diffrence</li>
            <li>Cheap 1970s mens cologne isnt the scent</li>
            <li>Overall, this product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.</li>
            <li>It lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use that much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I now buy them if the larger sizes because they are great for my problem hair.</li>
            <li>Great for mixed hair!</li>
            <li>It detangles and makes for overall great manageability.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nothing is a over night miracle but this is really fantastic</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiney and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The conditioner did some fantastic things for my hair.</li>
            <li>the it&#x27;s a 10 Miracle volumizing lite leave in was free of Parabens.</li>
            <li>Excellent on my dried, fried and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>I will always enjoy it .</li>
            <li>My hair hadn&#x27;t hasnt felt so smooth since childhood.</li>
            <li>I leave the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is so great.  </li>
            <li>I am Asian so this product works amazingly great.</li>
            <li>This product has given me the faith I needed to think my hair can grow out long and beautiful</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and a lot of it, so I use a good amount of conditioner when I shower.</li>
            <li>Also did not do any good for my somewhat sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>When i had minor breakage the first time, i used the original its a 10 mask and that stuff is AWESOME as well, but the mask PLUS keratin is OFF THE CHARTS for ANY hair type!!</li>
            <li>This is one of several products recommended to me and it works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the Its a 10 moisturizing and not as good as my usual protein conditioner.</li>
            <li>B004ZWH39A Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner]] are sooo much cheaper, smell good, and work pretty well</li>
            <li>Made my hair smooth and it LOOKS healthy ;)</li>
            <li>I am all the time trying new conditioners since I color and highlight my hair and the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a10&amp;#34; line of products keeps my hair from so much damage because it does a great job detangling the hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and shiny, I love it!</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li>I bleach, I dye, I don&#x27;t treat it well, and mine is super fine butt length hair.</li>
            <li>Worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deep conditioner found to date - thanks to all the others for great reviews</li>
            <li>I like the original products though.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>The heat really helps the product work better, and I have both leaving it in for  just 5 minutes and rinsing it as well as the 20 minute with heat method and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more alive, moving effortlessly and is more touchable.</li>
            <li>That should get your hair plenty clean without damaging it.</li>
            <li>This product made my dry hair look great again.</li>
            <li>I thought the reviews were so great that I would buy this for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product and the conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better, but I gave the benefit of the doubt because of all the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I have super frizzy hair and nothing is able to keep my hair straight except this stuff!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is pure magic, my chemically damaged hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works wonders for repairing your hair but if you have curly hair it will take the curl right out!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great conditioner, definitely one of the tops one I have used.</li>
            <li>The Keratin is tenth on the ingredient list, so i doubt there is even that much in there, but my hair likes this stuff better.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, I stop the shower and move my gray-water collecting buckets about, pushing a full one to the rear.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for just about anybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for just about anybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy through Amazon than most retail places.</li>
            <li>I have bathrooms full of hair products I&#x27;ve tried to manage my curly, frizzy hair, and I can throw them all away now.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your hair feel and look so healthy.</li>
            <li>Which is their silk serum, which I love because it can be used for so much and makes the hair crazies go away.</li>
            <li>I can noticeably feel and see the healthy difference in my hair, and the keratin is what really</li>
            <li>If your hair is very damaged and you&#x27;re looking for something to help make it healthy again</li>
            <li>But over all its a good deep conditioner .</li>
            <li>I myself have wavy blonde/brown hair that is healthy, so when I used it, I didn&#x27;t get much results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend soaking it for 15 minutes or longer to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Thanks. :)</li>
            <li>While this definitely makes your hair feel good in the shower</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it looks or feels as good as I was expecting  especially for  the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full of shine and bounce.  </li>
            <li>Good deep conditioner that helps keep my hair manageable .</li>
            <li>But the true test was when i was going straighten it how would it turn out?</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner smells wonderful to me and makes my hair super soft and way much stronger!!</li>
            <li>I typically use Pureology, Loma, Davines, and I have found this to be the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made a huge difference for my hair and especially if you have damaged hair this would work like magic!  </li>
            <li>My fly aways have pretty much disappeared and all of my hair is full and soft....</li>
            <li>Seriously they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-seems to absorb into hair really quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product is as described.</li>
            <li>My hair is super silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re fragrance-sensitive./&gt;On a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious.</li>
            <li>First time I used it a huge bunch of my hair came out.</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner, and the accompanying keratin shampoo and keratin miracle oil, and for the first time in my life my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>use this and it will feel and look better than when you had normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I usually use Joico moisture recovery treatment balm (it leaves my hair feeling smooth and it&#x27;s easy to brush through), but I had heard good things about this and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 has high reviews from people who already has perfect hair to begin with, but for the rest of us with severely dead zombies on our heads</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and I love the Keratin in the blow outs.  </li>
            <li>I love being a blonde from my now natural light brown, but coloring really dries out my hair and this stuff makes it smooth and shiny and healthy again!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is definitely a vast improvement to washing my hair with normal formulations, but it&#x27;s not quite as great as it could be.</li>
            <li>This product is a great buy for anyone who has given&lt;br /&gt;up on previous conditioners and truly believed their&lt;br /&gt;hair was permanently damaged forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this product for comparable performance to the higher end brands at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I know that if i was in a rush and didn&#x27;t have time to dry my hair, that my hair would still look good if i went out somewhere.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good wave in the back of my hair, so maybe that is why.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for carrying it!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how you would get a deep conditioner in a salon which many of you might identify with also!</li>
            <li>I am a believer and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a Great Hair Product and a Recommendation for Water Repurposing wherever you live, because if you&#x27;re not experiencing a drought this year, you might be next year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a Great Hair Product and a Recommendation for Water Repurposing wherever you live, because if you&#x27;re not experiencing a drought this year, you might be next year.</li>
            <li>slightly pricey, if you liked the smell of the leave-in spray, you&#x27;ll love the smell of this</li>
            <li>This is the BEST deep conditioner for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Love my Its a 10 Miracle Conditioner; it works great on my dry coarse hair,</li>
            <li>amazing, i seriously love the smell of this brand (although I like garnier-fructis a little</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner to help her hair but this stuff has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny too.</li>
            <li>The ends looked like they had been freshly trimmed, and I could run my hands through my hair with no snags or breakage.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is hydrating and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This will have taken about 60-90 seconds, so now I turn the warm water back on while collecting the run-off as I did during the bathing shower and the shampoo cycle of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Loved this product but just not enough to drop that much money again.</li>
            <li>It also leaves behind a very pleasant smell!</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how soft and healthy my hair is after using this.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice deep conditioner treatment but the fact that its keratin you have to watch out.</li>
            <li>For me it is worth the trade off.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoping... if I left it in my hair for 5 mins, my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>Recommend to any hair type and length, worth the money every ounce.</li>
            <li>I love my soft hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent; adds lots of volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My sister, who has wavy, more coarse blonde hair, used it and got good results.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as cheap as the Milk product I used, but I think it actually works better.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>My hair feels SO soft and it&#x27;s looking so much better</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I leave it in my hair overnight and it leaves my hair feeling soft :)</li>
            <li>I rarely ever break out.  </li>
            <li>They all have high quality ingredients and are far more cost effective ranging from $.79/ounce compared to nearly $3/ounce for this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be switching back to my original favorite, Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner, but I&#x27;m never getting rid of the</li>
            <li>and i sleep with it in my hair and the next day my hair is as good as new!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super soft and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>i really loved this conditioner and have used the companies other products but wanted to try this keratin one.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I got a straight perm for the first time in my life, and this is one of the products my stylist used to turn my hair into something it had never been before - silky smooth.</li>
            <li>If your hair is normal then this would probably be a fine product to use.</li>
            <li>after the FIRST time using it, my hair was incredibly soft, I kept running my hands through it, it FELT fuller, I don&#x27;t understand how, it&#x27;s like magic unicorn-blood conditioner...</li>
            <li>This one makes my hair very soft and easy to comb .  </li>
            <li>I love that I only have to use so little to get great results.</li>
            <li>have used aussie, pantene, paul mitchell, dove, tigi (moisture maniac), and probably a half dozen others, and this stuff totally works the best for me.</li>
            <li>:) I wish there was a bigger bottle because this runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love how weightless it makes my hair feel, but I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the price or worth buying again for now.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curly and extremely frizzy, the kind that poofs into a fuzz ball when it dries!</li>
            <li>think it will fix their hair in a day and saying only works for people with perfect hair not true and saying its making your hair fall out???  </li>
            <li>But when I rinsed it out, my hair was silky soft and easily detangled.</li>
            <li>(typically that&#x27;s 4 good</li>
            <li>but I really want to grow my hair and this product keeps my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I started with the basic shampoo and conditioner, but I do have really processed (used to perm my hair, then colored it, then bleached it, then colored it, then bleached it out again) and this stuff makes my hair feel so amazing.</li>
            <li>After one application my hair had amazing volume (no other product has done this) and very soft.</li>
            <li>It does leave the hair feeling soft right after, but my hair is still dry &amp; frizzy the next day, so not the best.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s one reason this set doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, because it really wants the conditioner second like normal, and the results are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t sink in and seal the cuticle with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisture the way &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair soft and calms the frizzies..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super healthy, but this stuff made it dry.</li>
            <li>I use it much much less frequently, it really has a very nice effect on my hair which lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I was having problems with breaking hair and tangles-- too much overprocessing!</li>
            <li>Only then do I start to unwrap my hair letting it acclimate to the air before combing or parting, but not for more than 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Love this deep condtioner!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li>so I love trying different products.</li>
            <li>also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of their hair products.</li>
            <li>Makes a difference from first time use.</li>
            <li>More for shampooing than actually deep conditioning and repairing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these products and totally recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li>This product was also a lot more affordable on Amazon then in the salon or regular drug stores.</li>
            <li>My favorite products out of the line are the miracle deep conditioner, the conditioning mask, and the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and able to tell my hair is softer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner because I bleach my hair blonde</li>
            <li>This product works great for long blonde curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t fall off the face of the planet like Milk ;)</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;ve had this stuff since I first sprouted hair.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine if you leave it in for more time.</li>
            <li>This does exactly as it says it does</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>very silky conditioner!</li>
            <li>Use this and some Willa oil and your hair will be much improved!</li>
            <li>If you really need it, this product would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using this after my hair stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I checked recently at CVS and it was $10 more there</li>
            <li>So the first time I used it...</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I use this on my ends and on the top layer of hair on my head and then use regular conditioner after</li>
            <li>Great product, works well on my dry curly hair, especially living in CO.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper conditioner that probably works equally well available on amazon (the Mane n Tail conditioner is pretty ballin&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: expensive, but if you like the smell and quality, might be worth splurging on yourself to feel great about your hair!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally straighten my hair everyday, but with this in it, my hair is so healthy that I can straighten more often if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>My hair was so smooth and soft, and much cheaper than purchasing at a store or salon.</li>
            <li>I thought I finally found a product line that would do as it say&#x27;s since it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the the best deep conditioner that I have used, and the first time I used it, I followed all of the directions, and my hair felt so soft and silky after it dried.</li>
            <li>Because of the inordinate number of positive reviews about</li>
            <li>I have bright red hair that was being dyed every month for maintenance and my hair was very damaged and after getting it chopped off and multiple trims almost all of the damaged ends are gone</li>
            <li>I now use once a week along with the miracle shine spray and my long hair is silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying some shampoo and other items for my hair cuz it&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much wrecked my hair with bleach and dye at this point.</li>
            <li>I have long hair almost to my waist and the Florida humidity make the frizz overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>My hair had become pretty damaged through too much use of blow dryers and my straightening device.  </li>
            <li>Is almost a miracle, really it works since first use.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted me a full year and my hair is silky soft every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I have tried TONS of products to help with the frizzyness, softness and breakage and so far I have not found anything that works as good as this product and the other</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling amazing and it does not leave it weighted down.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend for thick hair it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>The hair is less weighed down, which can be good, but the ends tend to be a bit fly-away, though not truly static frizzy, with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My ends didn&#x27;t look split and my hair is SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li>Does a very decent job of coating the hair and giving it some bounce, but the *perfume*, to me, kills this product.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve gotten a keratin treatment, so finding a product that all the aforementioned criteria PLUS keratin was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my hair feel, I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever had tangle free hair after shampooing &amp; using this deep conditioner by</li>
            <li>Makes my colored, processed hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>makes my hair super soft and it has helped me through my heat damage recovery.</li>
            <li>To get super soft hair, wash hair in the evening, put this conditioner on (do not rinse), tie and wrap hair in aluminum foil over night, sleep.</li>
            <li>Turns your hair into pure silk.  </li>
            <li>I like the Macadamia Nut Oil line, or Redken Smooth Down far better.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years I can avoid washing my hair daily if I want as hair still looks and feels clean, yet isn&#x27;t oily from residue of conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff and worth the money if you have naturally curly/frizzy hair, highlighted, colored or dried hair or drying, aging hair.</li>
            <li>I put conditioner on, finish the rest of my shower routine, and as the very last step, I use shampoo on my hair (just the roots/crown area, not the ponytail/ends area), and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>ANOTHER THANKS</li>
            <li>This product really helps condition it and keep it manageable and help control the frizz.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could say I&#x27;ve seen some real results, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It almost seems as if the scent chemicals constitute the majority of this conditioner, and if you read the list of ingredients, that may be very close to the truth indeed.</li>
            <li>so it goes fast.</li>
            <li>This product was very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I expected more than what the product provided at this price.</li>
            <li>The product works very well when used in conjunction with the</li>
            <li>The conditioner keeps my very frizzy hair in line and works well in detangling all the knots.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use it too much you will have breakage.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for my hair.....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this deep conditioner for a few months now and it truly is the best deep conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>wanted to share with you all how I use it because this really helps magnify the affect on my hair.</li>
            <li>Save your money go to Walmart and buy Garnier Moroccan oil, Neutrogena triple moisture deep conditioner mask and Loreal Advanced Recovery Repair mask.</li>
            <li>I have been spending so much money on shampoo you buy from the salon.</li>
            <li>I tried everything this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I use this after pureology volume shampoo...squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing as if I used a 2 dollar conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>really works well to restore hair after a chemical process</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Fast.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this weekly, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>Also works well diluted with water and sprayed on as a leave in on both curly and straight.</li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>So much easier, and I just use it once a week and leave it on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Oh, really, fool?</li>
            <li>Really. . .&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li>This worked really well.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not lather very well.  </li>
            <li>, my advice is to learn about what keratin does to hair and why and when it&#x27;s really needed.  </li>
            <li>However, not everybody really needs a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair feel like absolute silk when rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I really damaged my hair by over-processing it.</li>
            <li>then deep conditioned it with the deep conditioner with a bit of shea butter conditioner and WOW after my shower my hair smelled great, and was soft.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the product came on time.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel super smooth and not too weighed down.</li>
            <li>But caution, if your hair is extremely healthy to begin with, do not use this product often as your hair isnt lacking as much protein as those of us with extreme breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older and used heating products, my hair started to look more and more unhealthy.</li>
            <li>Other conditioners can make my hair smoother or more volume but this works beyond that.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and gets frizzy easily.  </li>
            <li>But it is a good product, and if your hair is dry, brittle, rough, curly, it should work very well.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this made maintaining soft, shiny hair easier. :)</li>
            <li>This product is good but it is a little heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is very smooth and cuts down on the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be like the regular conditioner PLUS a good keratin/protein, but instead it seems to be less of each.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dry from chemical coloring and gray course hair (under my color).</li>
            <li>Point:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to help make my hair easier to straighten but was weary of actual KEratin treatments because i heard some arnt good for african american hair.</li>
            <li>Smoothed my hair from top to bottom without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using their products, they work so much better than a lot of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much.</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, my hair straightened sooooo much easier than usual, it smelled amazing, and was soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>Now that my hair has really changed since I turned 50 (gray, wiry, and frizzy), I had to find new hair smoothing products.  </li>
            <li>SMOOTH FEEL TO DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for swimmers and generally dry haired folks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a ton of different deep conditioners, and some do ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I&#x27;m only giving it four stars instead of five because I wish they sold it in the same size bottle as the shampoo, I always have to buy two bottles of conditioner</li>
            <li>I use both products but at different times depending on the current needs of my hair :)</li>
            <li>but I straighten it or put it up most of the time) hair that I have regularly dyed about every 5-6 weeks for several years.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but can buy locally for same price as Amazon</li>
            <li>I bought this product 2 month ago based on the good reviews on the web, and used it few times before I finally gave up.</li>
            <li>I am loyal to this entire line of products.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t really need the keratin treatment part.  </li>
            <li>It was nice and soft when I dried it</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it....</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the high review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all Its A 10 products.  </li>
            <li>the 17.5 oz bottle is a complete RIP OFF!!</li>
            <li>I use less than the recommended amount and wash it out after less than a minute and it works great.</li>
            <li>I particularly bought this product because of my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t think expensive brands actually work better, and opt for the cheaper store brands, but I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I thought at first my hair was a little greasy after using, but then realized that is how smooth hair feels like.  </li>
            <li>my hair used to look really dull, kind of brittle, it was frizzy even though I combed out&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner - my stylist pretty much demanded I use what she did - and it makes my hair so much easier to come through and softer to the tough.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth the price since I use very little.</li>
            <li>I only listened to my sister years ago my hair would have been gorgeous such a long time ago!!!</li>
            <li>so I was skeptical to buy this even after all of the great reviews</li>
            <li>Sadly, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again but definitely a great product</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I shampoo as normal then comb this through my hair in the shower and leave in for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I started shampooing normally, and just using this conditioner as leave in after.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t condition the way I normally do, but just put a pea sized amount in my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>After I used it a few times none would come out of the squirter, so I tried to get the cap off because we all know you can scrape more out of the bottle....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this 2-3x a week now for about 5 mins in the shower after my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can feel a thickness that I was missing and my hair looks like it has more life and body.</li>
            <li>The product is worth using, especially if they were to redesign the tube.</li>
            <li>This product helps tame my curly, frizzy hair and leaves it healthy and silky.  </li>
            <li>though it is more expensive than most regular conditioners, but it turned out to be relatively much cheaper since 1)</li>
            <li>yourself some frustration and a lot of money and invest in a deep conditioner that&#x27;s actually good for your tresses such as Garnier Fructis Fortifying Deep Conditioner - Sleek &amp; Shine 3 Minute Masque, Curl Junkie Curl Rehab Moisturizing Hair Treatment, or perhaps Bee Mine Bee-U-Ti-Ful Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s very good, but not good enough to de-throne the Suave Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have fine curly hair - this product will only dry it out more (it has alcohol in it) and weight down the curls (i.e. no bounce, no curl).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as other products.  </li>
            <li>Just like all of their other products, this conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It morphs your hair into silky shiny new hair.</li>
            <li>Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water.</li>
            <li>It looks like I got a new hairdo overnight....</li>
            <li>which is a new thing for me.</li>
            <li>I heard Redkin has a new keratin line I might try...but not until I restore my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had a new head of hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner combo for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>and i new</li>
            <li>WHY make the HUGE bottle if there is only a tiny amount of conditioner stored in the cap!!!!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on the bottle (put into clean dry hair, wait 5 minutes, rinse out), and my hair feels so incredibly soft now.</li>
            <li>It was actually rather healthy before I got this, but I was curious how it would work.</li>
            <li>The conditioner also does not seem to weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparently too much protein for the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 makes it so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky and tames my normally frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>I put my hair through hell and this made it so soft!  </li>
            <li>I find other products that are 1/2 the price to work better for deep conditioning</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After the improvement it did the first time, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything further.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>Made my hair Instantaneously soft and eliminated tangles!  </li>
            <li>and ordinarily I have super fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very dull, dry and brittle and since I started to use this product once a week, I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li>Ive been free of all that for a year and a half on a count of my hair falling out after awhile of me putting my hair thru that.</li>
            <li>worth it for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It also notoriously fades hair color by dissolving and grabbing unbound dye molecules that are easily accessible near the exterior of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;There are other problems, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the major high end brands, and I would say this stands up just as well as products I&#x27;ve used from Bumble and Bumble, Davines, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty normal just has a dry day once in a while, however, I can not tell the difference between a cheaper product and this product</li>
            <li>and I actually got it in less than 24 hours, which was amazing - especially considering the fact that my hair was so damaged</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s dark red, light red to orange tips.</li>
            <li>no need to push hard or put more.</li>
            <li>I never really cared much or paid much attention to &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products although my sister had sworn by them for years....</li>
            <li>Hair feels smooth after useage, not too heavy and does not make hair greasy at any point during the day.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s soft and shines.</li>
            <li>This makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had enough time to really give it a go.</li>
            <li>Must have for Naturally Curly hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner was a complete wast of money.</li>
            <li>but I tried it and have used it 2 times so far</li>
            <li>Before, I would have had to straighten my hair and apply a styling oil for it to feel this soft.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair soft</li>
            <li>My hair feel so silky and soft after using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and shiny and does what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>These cheaper brand items fixed my hair in no time.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and shiny..really like it</li>
            <li>I also color my hair frequently.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so silky soft until I used</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li>This fixed my over processed and damaged hair within one week of use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft but also leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, manageable and feels a lot thicker to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li>Curls are completely gone</li>
            <li>So silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>when i do wash it out my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li>I use it and it leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This is not a leave-in conditioner - I do rinse it out - but it still makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>I think when it does wash out it pulls your natural vitamins out with it.</li>
            <li>If used as deep conditioner it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>This made my hair really soft and it felt healthier.</li>
            <li>I have my hair professionally bleached and my ends look it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does seem to make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I like this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin&amp;#34; better than the regular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner.&amp;#34;  This stuff leaves my thick, coarse, &amp; wavy hair silkier &amp; more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, course, kinky/curly hair that has tons of fly aways and tends to look dried out.</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner as far as making my hair feel good, but the smell is awful!  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical that it would be a good conditioner--there&#x27;s always a catch.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, thick hair prone to tangling, and it does a pretty good job of conditioning and removing tangles, though I recently upgraded to their conditioning MASK to use in lieu of this / regular conditioner</li>
            <li>this deep conditioner brought it right back to life</li>
            <li>Have very dry fine , long, colored hair.</li>
            <li>I put the deep conditioner in as leave-in conditioner (just a little everyday) and it makes my hair super silky and soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I will be trying other cheaper plus keratin shampoos and conditioners to see if this is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>I tried so many products in the past months but nothing brought it back to life like the</li>
            <li>So first, let me just say i am a platinum blonde and have been for 2 years, but recently i was experiencing SEVERE</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>Because I have fine hair, I only use this product once a week, then just a little bit.  </li>
            <li>It was so soft and even shiny (which my hair isn&#x27;t until after i flat iron it after blow drying) and was even straighter than normal.</li>
            <li>I normally have a hay bale for a head of hair - and got a sample of this recently with another purchase - and tried it out.  </li>
            <li>Since it looks like conventional conditioner, I don&#x27;t know why it works better than conventional conditioner, but it does.  </li>
            <li>I have very long chemically treated hair and I see a very noticeable difference when I use the</li>
            <li>very helpful for my dry and over processed hair</li>
            <li>Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I have some dry ends and this really softens them.</li>
            <li>I have really fried dry damaged hair from bleach highlights.</li>
            <li>My old organix shampoo and conditioner that has always left my hair soft did not do the job anymore.</li>
            <li>had soft, lush hair and totally supple ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A small amount is good and I am not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>The round pink 10 in this brand is way better</li>
            <li>I only leave it in my hair for about 5-7 minutes and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m crazy about hair products and when I first starting using this and the leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>When I first got this I used every other wash (about twice a week).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know any other product that can do that much!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s some of the major offenders:&lt;br /&gt;Silicones</li>
            <li>I have always chemically straightened it so it has gone through major damage.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse dry frizzy hair that I overbleached last year and tried so many different shampoos and conditioners, most of them expensive organic brands</li>
            <li>The directions are not like regular conditioner: You towel dry your hair first, section it, put the conditioner in, then brush it.</li>
            <li>It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I have hair that often tucks into my pants (so long that the oils from my sccalp rarely reach the ends) and it  is very dry.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the leave-in spray worked so well that I decided to try the conditioner and its amazing.  </li>
            <li>Have a larger size pump version now because I went through this tube version so fast with long hair.</li>
            <li>I like the conditioning effect well enough, but would never contemplate buying again because of the headache-inducing, far too heavy-handed perfume.</li>
            <li>My six year old daughter has blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I only used it on my ends though because I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m over-doing it especially since this says it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, but again, now that I really need it, I don&#x27;t think the deep conditioning part is over-doing it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that it has eliminated my monthly&lt;br /&gt;end trimmings and put a stop to daily snags in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it now every time I wash my hair (about twice a week) because no regular conditioner leaves my hair as soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I went crazy trying to find a product that was just as good and didn&#x27;t cost a billion dollars.</li>
            <li>With medium heat on the hair dryer, I consistently run fingers through and down my hair trying to provide non-partisan assurance to each section of my hair awaiting its turn.</li>
            <li>I have long, dry hair, &amp; use a hot curling iron to style.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied it in the shower, it didn&#x27;t feel any different than other conditioners.</li>
            <li>The other products are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used where I can let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I dabbed it on while it was almost dry and used it as smoother/styling product that my crazy hair (super processed and with split ends) finally looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out.</li>
            <li>Because it never hurts to condition your hair and this product is a part of the shampoo in the same brand, I do believe I will continue to use it because I&#x27;m left with soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li>While I do like what it does for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do enough to be worth the money for that few uses.</li>
            <li>It totally softens you hair like no other.</li>
            <li>The only major difference I can tell is that my hair is softer.</li>
            <li>, yes, I think this keratin alters my color to a certain extent, but the benefits of how it improves the quality and actual condition of my hair makes me continue to use this about every other hair wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it is a great condioner, however I think this was used and returned, the tube had very little in it, disappointed !</li>
            <li>My hair is usually completely normal, but it&#x27;s been dry recently.</li>
            <li>It actually works just as a general conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have really long (naturally wavy</li>
            <li>After using this the first time I couldn’t tell any difference, than I used it again for a second time and didn’t notice anything, to me it is not worth the money or the extra min or two in the shower!</li>
            <li>I was actually not getting the miracle by rinsing it out as apparently everyone else does.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dried out and damaged on the ends because I&#x27;ve used bleach.  </li>
            <li>and it really weighed my hair down</li>
            <li>The dry brittle ends from winter heating season were magically fixed.</li>
            <li>It saves my bleach blonde hair after a salon treatment by stopping snapping, healing split ends, and putting moisture back into my hair in general.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about the price, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair began falling out and breaking off in little pieces, littering my sink after brushing my hair, no matter how gentle I detangled.</li>
            <li>I use a little dab on my ends every night after my shower and my hair looks and feels so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>I would recommend leaving the conditioner in a little longer than they recommend about 10ish mins to really give it a chance to work.</li>
            <li>[no water turned on, I now squeeze about 2-peas&#x27; worth into my hand, then stretch my hands throughout my still wet hair [yes, I&#x27;m a little chilly without warm water</li>
            <li>im inlove with this product and will continue to use it 1ce a month because i heard toomuch of a good thing is bad</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The best part is that this conditioner leaves a protective coating on the hair, that when heat is applied, it seals the shaft, leaving hair glossy, silky, and almost virgin-like.</li>
            <li> ;  products are all excellent.  </li>
            <li> Loved it nothing like it befote always have to have!!!</li>

            <li> Love it, awesome products.</li>
            <li> There is not one ingredient in any of these products that is damaging use it for more than one day your hair won&#x27;t become &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but there is not one product on earth that can make something perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and awesome results.</li>
            <li> Great, love it!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for fine hair, or any type of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10, but this is some really wonderful stuff that made my hair feel soft, silky, and awesome!</li>
            <li> and you will get good aspect</li>
            <li> Good investment.</li>
            <li> I give it a light rinse at best, then turn the water off and admire the buckets of gray water</li>
            <li> It is a good product</li>
            <li> It is a good sized bottle that lasts a while if used once a week.</li>
            <li> (Unless I find a really good deal)</li>
            <li> There are some really good silicones out there - ones with the prefix PPG or PEG come to mind (neither of which are found in this product).&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is a good product, I recoment it</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a good job of moisturizing my hair, and i do not have any problems with tangles after washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I passed it on to a friend, and she hasn&#x27;t said she loved it</li>
            <li> My friend ( who has gorgeous shiny hair) recommended this</li>
            <li> My ends feel good too</li>
            <li> Not as good as the silk collection by</li>
            <li> have never used a conditioner as good as this.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t have hair products that don&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because it keeps my frizzy hair a bit under control, is not my fave, but for the price I think is a good deal..</li>
            <li> But I still gave it 5 stars because it works that good.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think its doing me any good.</li>
            <li> saying i needed it and this product had good reviews</li>
            <li> Product itself was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Sometimes just a good conditioner and leave-in spray or finishing oil will</li>
            <li> and my husband kept saying how good my hair smelled.</li>
            <li> I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> All of them are good</li>
            <li> Perfect looks like my hair original.</li>

            <li> love how this makes my hair feel and smells great..makes hair softer and tames fly aways</li>
            <li> It will do a great job no matter which technique you use (as I&#x27;ve seen many commenters describe their processes).</li>
            <li> my hair is getting softer and more manageable,i used the silk conditioner but this is helping greatly too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the softness that I feel when I run my hands through my hair.  </li>

            <li> I felt it didn&#x27;t do anything that spectacular for me for the price and</li>
            <li> Probably could use a cheaper kind if you find one.</li>
            <li> and I like how my hair is nice and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> This hair product is aptly named as being a miracle.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing, I love it.</li>

            <li> you liked the smell of the leave-in spray, you&#x27;ll love the smell of this&lt;br /&gt;-BEFORE:</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever purchased and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Their Amazing Grace conditioner was the best for my hair, especially after swimming.  </li>
            <li> While my hair feels good after the treatment I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything special for the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is now very healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and creamy, and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been in such great condition.!!!</li>

            <li> Then I stop for 5-10 minutes, continue dressing, while my hair thinks things over and decides to cooperate for the greater</li>
            <li> I love this product ..</li>
            <li> I was better off using my $4 Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will be using more of this.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Have already purchased more.  </li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviewers here who have given it a five-star.</li>
            <li> Love love love these products.</li>
            <li> It is for sure a miracle in a tube.  </li>
            <li> and I just fell in love with it.</li>

            <li> I love it and would have bought it in gallon sized if I could have.</li>
            <li> Not in love with this one.</li>
            <li> I love a lot of It</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just ok for me.</li>
            <li> just found out about using keratin more and anything with it in it has to be used sparingly.</li>
            <li> as it does an even better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this company makes paraben-free, sulfate-free products that also do not do animal testing.  </li>
            <li> I am on the fence as to if it makes my hair feel more straw like than with</li>
            <li> I get many complements on how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> There are many ingredients listed that cause skin irritation, and in some cases aggravating existing eczema problems.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and the effect it has on my hair</li>
            <li> BUT for those of you worried about increasing the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; of your hair....you will have to wash it more often.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now and love it.</li>
            <li> On one hand, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li> You are better off getting Mane N Tail conditioner and using that than this *</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so much better then</li>
            <li> I love it and well purchase again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair, hope with repeated use, it will get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one works.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I prefer something that leaves my hair feeling more silky.  </li>
            <li> works better than what i used to get at the beauty salon...</li>
            <li> in LOVE with</li>
            <li> and it made it produce more oil...</li>
            <li> Am wondering how many of those reviews were bought.</li>

            <li> In LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled, even though this is sold in the retail market many hairdressers use it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> MORE SHININESS (NOT GREASY SHINY, LUSTER SHINY!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the keratin line of products.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I believe the 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, 5 oz, would be great once I receive it!!!  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The course/dry spots on the top of my head were shiny and silky too.</li>
            <li> and i will never use any hair mask on my hair ever again unless its from Its a 10, just an overall AWESOME brand</li>
            <li> I will update this review if the condition of my hair changes after more use.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a brush through my hair with no difficulty.</li>
            <li> i love how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I would more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have some allergies to chemicals and this one fits my ok list.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the shower and put a shower cap on my hair just so that the products could penetrate more and the water won&#x27;t wash it out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally more like a tumbleweed.</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews of It&#x27;s a 10 products for quite awhile, I finally decided to give them a try and soooooooo glad that I did!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have waist length hair too:)</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners currently on the market.  </li>
            <li> If you have a water softener, even better for your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard before not to use keratin if you have healthy hair</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if you have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Until it grows out, there is nothing better that we have found.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it over, and over again.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I will for sure purchase</li>
            <li> but it looks better</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what it does, if anything, but i did notice more compliments about my hair and more women wanted to play with it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner, and I have never said that about a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is better.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, and it&#x27;s good...but not the best.</li>
            <li> a bit shinier, more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so I think I can probably get 1, maybe 2, more treatments from a bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like to wear my hair straight, so thought the Keratin would be great.  </li>
            <li> All in all, for the price, I think there are better combo&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and its fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would use this again to keep my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner more.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also very fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair so soft and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I gave you a great list of what I used for my bleached out breaking hair that is more normal now.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft and even if I don&#x27;t straighten it ( which I do do most days), it dries into beautiful relaxed curls and never gets frizzy at all EVEN ON RAINY DAYS -</li>
            <li> Works great- leaves you hair feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 makes my mother&#x27;s hair soft and beautiful...</li>
            <li> Uber worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this is my new go to hair treatment.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and allows me to curl it more easily.</li>
            <li> Repairs dry, damaged, colored hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li> the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard already, if you have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s best to &amp;#34;co-wash,&amp;#34; as they call it.</li>
            <li> conditioner was good, but not quite as good as the shampoo of the same set, but it does make hair smoother and</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes your hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I like this more than that, but, it did a fine job at softening my hair and detangling it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is okay, nothing special, but also not awful.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, waist length fine hair, and this conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The scent, which I find deeply disagreeable to begin with, is incredibly cloying and overpowering.</li>
            <li> I just bought hair oil, that seems works better to keep hair shine and smooth</li>
            <li> After years of damaging my hair and trying countless products, my hair is finally healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> , It smells great and my hair is soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> It left me with an incredible amount of breakage that will take months to grow out.  </li>
            <li> When I use this conditioner it helps to smooth it out and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> silky smooth after use :)</li>
            <li> Wow i cant even tell you how great</li>
            <li> Really good product , it leaves your hair very silky.</li>
            <li> This product helped my hair so much to look good again.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this as I&#x27;ve witnessed the magic of keratin on my hair before.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging; the squeeze tube is easy to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT ( I use the miracle shampoo, miracle deep conditioner plus keratin, and the miracle leave-in conditioner)  :)))</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my hair and makes it easy to style</li>
            <li> Makes comb through really easy and leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great deep conditioner since I love the leave-in treatment..</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the little fly aways on the top of my head after I used this which was nice.</li>
            <li> Have fine hair that gets oily easily.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good, I think, for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> love it and it came quickly</li>
            <li> The seller was quick too!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found it on Amazon for $16!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my quick shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> In the morning, rinse hair and your hair will be super soft with great smell.</li>
            <li> perfect, but little amount</li>
            <li> this deep conditioner is good for you, whereas if your hair is in good condition but very dry the miracle mask is a good choice for you.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried using the Leave-In Potion when using another conditioner, and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same great smooth and shiny effect.</li>
            <li> amazing I really love how soft and shinny my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair so I can tell a huge difference with this one.</li>
            <li> but I did see a huge diffrence</li>
            <li> Cheap 1970s mens cologne isnt the scent</li>
            <li> Overall, this product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.</li>
            <li> It lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use that much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I now buy them if the larger sizes because they are great for my problem hair.</li>
            <li> Great for mixed hair!</li>
            <li> It detangles and makes for overall great manageability.  </li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nothing is a over night miracle but this is really fantastic</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiney and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The conditioner did some fantastic things for my hair.</li>
            <li> the it&#x27;s a 10 Miracle volumizing lite leave in was free of Parabens.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my dried, fried and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I will always enjoy it .</li>
            <li> My hair hadn&#x27;t hasnt felt so smooth since childhood.</li>
            <li> I leave the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is so great.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian so this product works amazingly great.</li>
            <li> This product has given me the faith I needed to think my hair can grow out long and beautiful</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and a lot of it, so I use a good amount of conditioner when I shower.</li>
            <li> Also did not do any good for my somewhat sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> When i had minor breakage the first time, i used the original its a 10 mask and that stuff is AWESOME as well, but the mask PLUS keratin is OFF THE CHARTS for ANY hair type!!</li>
            <li> This is one of several products recommended to me and it works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the Its a 10 moisturizing and not as good as my usual protein conditioner.</li>
            <li> B004ZWH39A Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner]] are sooo much cheaper, smell good, and work pretty well</li>
            <li> Made my hair smooth and it LOOKS healthy ;)</li>
            <li> I am all the time trying new conditioners since I color and highlight my hair and the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a10&amp;#34; line of products keeps my hair from so much damage because it does a great job detangling the hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and shiny, I love it!</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bleach, I dye, I don&#x27;t treat it well, and mine is super fine butt length hair.</li>
            <li> Worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deep conditioner found to date - thanks to all the others for great reviews</li>
            <li> I like the original products though.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> The heat really helps the product work better, and I have both leaving it in for  just 5 minutes and rinsing it as well as the 20 minute with heat method and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more alive, moving effortlessly and is more touchable.</li>
            <li> That should get your hair plenty clean without damaging it.</li>
            <li> This product made my dry hair look great again.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews were so great that I would buy this for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and the conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better, but I gave the benefit of the doubt because of all the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy hair and nothing is able to keep my hair straight except this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pure magic, my chemically damaged hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for repairing your hair but if you have curly hair it will take the curl right out!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great conditioner, definitely one of the tops one I have used.</li>
            <li> The Keratin is tenth on the ingredient list, so i doubt there is even that much in there, but my hair likes this stuff better.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I stop the shower and move my gray-water collecting buckets about, pushing a full one to the rear.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for just about anybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for just about anybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy through Amazon than most retail places.</li>
            <li> I have bathrooms full of hair products I&#x27;ve tried to manage my curly, frizzy hair, and I can throw them all away now.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your hair feel and look so healthy.</li>
            <li> Which is their silk serum, which I love because it can be used for so much and makes the hair crazies go away.</li>
            <li> I can noticeably feel and see the healthy difference in my hair, and the keratin is what really</li>
            <li> If your hair is very damaged and you&#x27;re looking for something to help make it healthy again</li>
            <li> But over all its a good deep conditioner .</li>
            <li> I myself have wavy blonde/brown hair that is healthy, so when I used it, I didn&#x27;t get much results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend soaking it for 15 minutes or longer to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> While this definitely makes your hair feel good in the shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it looks or feels as good as I was expecting  especially for  the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair full of shine and bounce.  </li>
            <li> Good deep conditioner that helps keep my hair manageable .</li>
            <li> But the true test was when i was going straighten it how would it turn out?</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner smells wonderful to me and makes my hair super soft and way much stronger!!</li>
            <li> I typically use Pureology, Loma, Davines, and I have found this to be the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made a huge difference for my hair and especially if you have damaged hair this would work like magic!  </li>
            <li> My fly aways have pretty much disappeared and all of my hair is full and soft....</li>
            <li> Seriously they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-seems to absorb into hair really quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described.</li>
            <li> My hair is super silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re fragrance-sensitive./&gt;On a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious.</li>
            <li> First time I used it a huge bunch of my hair came out.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner, and the accompanying keratin shampoo and keratin miracle oil, and for the first time in my life my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> use this and it will feel and look better than when you had normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I usually use Joico moisture recovery treatment balm (it leaves my hair feeling smooth and it&#x27;s easy to brush through), but I had heard good things about this and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 has high reviews from people who already has perfect hair to begin with, but for the rest of us with severely dead zombies on our heads</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and I love the Keratin in the blow outs.  </li>
            <li> I love being a blonde from my now natural light brown, but coloring really dries out my hair and this stuff makes it smooth and shiny and healthy again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is definitely a vast improvement to washing my hair with normal formulations, but it&#x27;s not quite as great as it could be.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy for anyone who has given&lt;br /&gt;up on previous conditioners and truly believed their&lt;br /&gt;hair was permanently damaged forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this product for comparable performance to the higher end brands at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I know that if i was in a rush and didn&#x27;t have time to dry my hair, that my hair would still look good if i went out somewhere.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good wave in the back of my hair, so maybe that is why.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says!  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for carrying it!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how you would get a deep conditioner in a salon which many of you might identify with also!</li>
            <li> I am a believer and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a Great Hair Product and a Recommendation for Water Repurposing wherever you live, because if you&#x27;re not experiencing a drought this year, you might be next year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a Great Hair Product and a Recommendation for Water Repurposing wherever you live, because if you&#x27;re not experiencing a drought this year, you might be next year.</li>
            <li> slightly pricey, if you liked the smell of the leave-in spray, you&#x27;ll love the smell of this</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deep conditioner for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Love my Its a 10 Miracle Conditioner; it works great on my dry coarse hair,</li>
            <li> amazing, i seriously love the smell of this brand (although I like garnier-fructis a little</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner to help her hair but this stuff has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny too.</li>
            <li> The ends looked like they had been freshly trimmed, and I could run my hands through my hair with no snags or breakage.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is hydrating and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This will have taken about 60-90 seconds, so now I turn the warm water back on while collecting the run-off as I did during the bathing shower and the shampoo cycle of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but just not enough to drop that much money again.</li>
            <li> It also leaves behind a very pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how soft and healthy my hair is after using this.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice deep conditioner treatment but the fact that its keratin you have to watch out.</li>
            <li> For me it is worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoping... if I left it in my hair for 5 mins, my hair was soft.</li>
            <li> Recommend to any hair type and length, worth the money every ounce.</li>
            <li> I love my soft hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent; adds lots of volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My sister, who has wavy, more coarse blonde hair, used it and got good results.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as cheap as the Milk product I used, but I think it actually works better.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> My hair feels SO soft and it&#x27;s looking so much better</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair overnight and it leaves my hair feeling soft :)</li>
            <li> I rarely ever break out.  </li>
            <li> They all have high quality ingredients and are far more cost effective ranging from $.79/ounce compared to nearly $3/ounce for this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be switching back to my original favorite, Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner, but I&#x27;m never getting rid of the</li>
            <li> and i sleep with it in my hair and the next day my hair is as good as new!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair super soft and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> i really loved this conditioner and have used the companies other products but wanted to try this keratin one.  </li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good replacement.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I got a straight perm for the first time in my life, and this is one of the products my stylist used to turn my hair into something it had never been before - silky smooth.</li>
            <li> If your hair is normal then this would probably be a fine product to use.</li>
            <li> after the FIRST time using it, my hair was incredibly soft, I kept running my hands through it, it FELT fuller, I don&#x27;t understand how, it&#x27;s like magic unicorn-blood conditioner...</li>
            <li> This one makes my hair very soft and easy to comb .  </li>
            <li> I love that I only have to use so little to get great results.</li>
            <li> have used aussie, pantene, paul mitchell, dove, tigi (moisture maniac), and probably a half dozen others, and this stuff totally works the best for me.</li>
            <li> :) I wish there was a bigger bottle because this runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love how weightless it makes my hair feel, but I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the price or worth buying again for now.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly and extremely frizzy, the kind that poofs into a fuzz ball when it dries!</li>
            <li> think it will fix their hair in a day and saying only works for people with perfect hair not true and saying its making your hair fall out???  </li>
            <li> But when I rinsed it out, my hair was silky soft and easily detangled.</li>
            <li> (typically that&#x27;s 4 good</li>
            <li> but I really want to grow my hair and this product keeps my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I started with the basic shampoo and conditioner, but I do have really processed (used to perm my hair, then colored it, then bleached it, then colored it, then bleached it out again) and this stuff makes my hair feel so amazing.</li>
            <li> After one application my hair had amazing volume (no other product has done this) and very soft.</li>
            <li> It does leave the hair feeling soft right after, but my hair is still dry &amp; frizzy the next day, so not the best.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s one reason this set doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, because it really wants the conditioner second like normal, and the results are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t sink in and seal the cuticle with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisture the way &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair soft and calms the frizzies..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super healthy, but this stuff made it dry.</li>
            <li> I use it much much less frequently, it really has a very nice effect on my hair which lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with breaking hair and tangles-- too much overprocessing!</li>
            <li> Only then do I start to unwrap my hair letting it acclimate to the air before combing or parting, but not for more than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Love this deep condtioner!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li> so I love trying different products.</li>
            <li> also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of their hair products.</li>
            <li> Makes a difference from first time use.</li>
            <li> More for shampooing than actually deep conditioning and repairing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products and totally recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li> This product was also a lot more affordable on Amazon then in the salon or regular drug stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite products out of the line are the miracle deep conditioner, the conditioning mask, and the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and able to tell my hair is softer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner because I bleach my hair blonde</li>
            <li> This product works great for long blonde curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t fall off the face of the planet like Milk ;)</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;ve had this stuff since I first sprouted hair.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine if you leave it in for more time.</li>
            <li> This does exactly as it says it does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> very silky conditioner!</li>
            <li> Use this and some Willa oil and your hair will be much improved!</li>
            <li> If you really need it, this product would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using this after my hair stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I checked recently at CVS and it was $10 more there</li>
            <li> So the first time I used it...</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use this on my ends and on the top layer of hair on my head and then use regular conditioner after</li>
            <li> Great product, works well on my dry curly hair, especially living in CO.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-cheaper conditioner that probably works equally well available on amazon (the Mane n Tail conditioner is pretty ballin&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: expensive, but if you like the smell and quality, might be worth splurging on yourself to feel great about your hair!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally straighten my hair everyday, but with this in it, my hair is so healthy that I can straighten more often if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> My hair was so smooth and soft, and much cheaper than purchasing at a store or salon.</li>
            <li> I thought I finally found a product line that would do as it say&#x27;s since it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the the best deep conditioner that I have used, and the first time I used it, I followed all of the directions, and my hair felt so soft and silky after it dried.</li>
            <li> Because of the inordinate number of positive reviews about</li>
            <li> I have bright red hair that was being dyed every month for maintenance and my hair was very damaged and after getting it chopped off and multiple trims almost all of the damaged ends are gone</li>
            <li> I now use once a week along with the miracle shine spray and my long hair is silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying some shampoo and other items for my hair cuz it&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much wrecked my hair with bleach and dye at this point.</li>
            <li> I have long hair almost to my waist and the Florida humidity make the frizz overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> My hair had become pretty damaged through too much use of blow dryers and my straightening device.  </li>
            <li> Is almost a miracle, really it works since first use.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted me a full year and my hair is silky soft every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried TONS of products to help with the frizzyness, softness and breakage and so far I have not found anything that works as good as this product and the other</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling amazing and it does not leave it weighted down.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend for thick hair it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> The hair is less weighed down, which can be good, but the ends tend to be a bit fly-away, though not truly static frizzy, with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My ends didn&#x27;t look split and my hair is SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li> Does a very decent job of coating the hair and giving it some bounce, but the *perfume*, to me, kills this product.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve gotten a keratin treatment, so finding a product that all the aforementioned criteria PLUS keratin was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel, I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever had tangle free hair after shampooing &amp; using this deep conditioner by</li>
            <li> Makes my colored, processed hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> makes my hair super soft and it has helped me through my heat damage recovery.</li>
            <li> To get super soft hair, wash hair in the evening, put this conditioner on (do not rinse), tie and wrap hair in aluminum foil over night, sleep.</li>
            <li> Turns your hair into pure silk.  </li>
            <li> I like the Macadamia Nut Oil line, or Redken Smooth Down far better.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years I can avoid washing my hair daily if I want as hair still looks and feels clean, yet isn&#x27;t oily from residue of conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff and worth the money if you have naturally curly/frizzy hair, highlighted, colored or dried hair or drying, aging hair.</li>
            <li> I put conditioner on, finish the rest of my shower routine, and as the very last step, I use shampoo on my hair (just the roots/crown area, not the ponytail/ends area), and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER THANKS</li>
            <li> This product really helps condition it and keep it manageable and help control the frizz.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could say I&#x27;ve seen some real results, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It almost seems as if the scent chemicals constitute the majority of this conditioner, and if you read the list of ingredients, that may be very close to the truth indeed.</li>
            <li> so it goes fast.</li>
            <li> This product was very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I expected more than what the product provided at this price.</li>
            <li> The product works very well when used in conjunction with the</li>
            <li> The conditioner keeps my very frizzy hair in line and works well in detangling all the knots.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it too much you will have breakage.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my hair.....</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this deep conditioner for a few months now and it truly is the best deep conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> wanted to share with you all how I use it because this really helps magnify the affect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Save your money go to Walmart and buy Garnier Moroccan oil, Neutrogena triple moisture deep conditioner mask and Loreal Advanced Recovery Repair mask.</li>
            <li> I have been spending so much money on shampoo you buy from the salon.</li>
            <li> I tried everything this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I use this after pureology volume shampoo...squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing as if I used a 2 dollar conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> really works well to restore hair after a chemical process</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Fast.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this weekly, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> Also works well diluted with water and sprayed on as a leave in on both curly and straight.</li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> So much easier, and I just use it once a week and leave it on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Oh, really, fool?</li>
            <li> Really. . .&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not lather very well.  </li>
            <li> , my advice is to learn about what keratin does to hair and why and when it&#x27;s really needed.  </li>
            <li> However, not everybody really needs a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel like absolute silk when rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I really damaged my hair by over-processing it.</li>
            <li> then deep conditioned it with the deep conditioner with a bit of shea butter conditioner and WOW after my shower my hair smelled great, and was soft.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the product came on time.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel super smooth and not too weighed down.</li>
            <li> But caution, if your hair is extremely healthy to begin with, do not use this product often as your hair isnt lacking as much protein as those of us with extreme breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older and used heating products, my hair started to look more and more unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners can make my hair smoother or more volume but this works beyond that.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and gets frizzy easily.  </li>
            <li> But it is a good product, and if your hair is dry, brittle, rough, curly, it should work very well.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this made maintaining soft, shiny hair easier. :)</li>
            <li> This product is good but it is a little heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is very smooth and cuts down on the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be like the regular conditioner PLUS a good keratin/protein, but instead it seems to be less of each.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and dry from chemical coloring and gray course hair (under my color).</li>
            <li> Point:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to help make my hair easier to straighten but was weary of actual KEratin treatments because i heard some arnt good for african american hair.</li>
            <li> Smoothed my hair from top to bottom without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using their products, they work so much better than a lot of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, my hair straightened sooooo much easier than usual, it smelled amazing, and was soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> Now that my hair has really changed since I turned 50 (gray, wiry, and frizzy), I had to find new hair smoothing products.  </li>
            <li> SMOOTH FEEL TO DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for swimmers and generally dry haired folks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of different deep conditioners, and some do ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I&#x27;m only giving it four stars instead of five because I wish they sold it in the same size bottle as the shampoo, I always have to buy two bottles of conditioner</li>
            <li> I use both products but at different times depending on the current needs of my hair :)</li>
            <li> but I straighten it or put it up most of the time) hair that I have regularly dyed about every 5-6 weeks for several years.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but can buy locally for same price as Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 month ago based on the good reviews on the web, and used it few times before I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> I am loyal to this entire line of products.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t really need the keratin treatment part.  </li>
            <li> It was nice and soft when I dried it</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the high review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all Its A 10 products.  </li>
            <li> the 17.5 oz bottle is a complete RIP OFF!!</li>
            <li> I use less than the recommended amount and wash it out after less than a minute and it works great.</li>
            <li> I particularly bought this product because of my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t think expensive brands actually work better, and opt for the cheaper store brands, but I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I thought at first my hair was a little greasy after using, but then realized that is how smooth hair feels like.  </li>
            <li> my hair used to look really dull, kind of brittle, it was frizzy even though I combed out&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner - my stylist pretty much demanded I use what she did - and it makes my hair so much easier to come through and softer to the tough.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth the price since I use very little.</li>
            <li> I only listened to my sister years ago my hair would have been gorgeous such a long time ago!!!</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical to buy this even after all of the great reviews</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again but definitely a great product</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I shampoo as normal then comb this through my hair in the shower and leave in for 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I started shampooing normally, and just using this conditioner as leave in after.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t condition the way I normally do, but just put a pea sized amount in my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> After I used it a few times none would come out of the squirter, so I tried to get the cap off because we all know you can scrape more out of the bottle....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2-3x a week now for about 5 mins in the shower after my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can feel a thickness that I was missing and my hair looks like it has more life and body.</li>
            <li> The product is worth using, especially if they were to redesign the tube.</li>
            <li> This product helps tame my curly, frizzy hair and leaves it healthy and silky.  </li>
            <li> though it is more expensive than most regular conditioners, but it turned out to be relatively much cheaper since 1)</li>
            <li> yourself some frustration and a lot of money and invest in a deep conditioner that&#x27;s actually good for your tresses such as Garnier Fructis Fortifying Deep Conditioner - Sleek &amp; Shine 3 Minute Masque, Curl Junkie Curl Rehab Moisturizing Hair Treatment, or perhaps Bee Mine Bee-U-Ti-Ful Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s very good, but not good enough to de-throne the Suave Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have fine curly hair - this product will only dry it out more (it has alcohol in it) and weight down the curls (i.e. no bounce, no curl).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as other products.  </li>
            <li> Just like all of their other products, this conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It morphs your hair into silky shiny new hair.</li>
            <li> Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water.</li>
            <li> It looks like I got a new hairdo overnight....</li>
            <li> which is a new thing for me.</li>
            <li> I heard Redkin has a new keratin line I might try...but not until I restore my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had a new head of hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner combo for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> and i new</li>
            <li> WHY make the HUGE bottle if there is only a tiny amount of conditioner stored in the cap!!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the bottle (put into clean dry hair, wait 5 minutes, rinse out), and my hair feels so incredibly soft now.</li>
            <li> It was actually rather healthy before I got this, but I was curious how it would work.</li>
            <li> The conditioner also does not seem to weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparently too much protein for the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 makes it so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky and tames my normally frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I put my hair through hell and this made it so soft!  </li>
            <li> I find other products that are 1/2 the price to work better for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> After the improvement it did the first time, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything further.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Made my hair Instantaneously soft and eliminated tangles!  </li>
            <li> and ordinarily I have super fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dull, dry and brittle and since I started to use this product once a week, I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li> Ive been free of all that for a year and a half on a count of my hair falling out after awhile of me putting my hair thru that.</li>
            <li> worth it for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It also notoriously fades hair color by dissolving and grabbing unbound dye molecules that are easily accessible near the exterior of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;There are other problems, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the major high end brands, and I would say this stands up just as well as products I&#x27;ve used from Bumble and Bumble, Davines, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty normal just has a dry day once in a while, however, I can not tell the difference between a cheaper product and this product</li>
            <li> and I actually got it in less than 24 hours, which was amazing - especially considering the fact that my hair was so damaged</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s dark red, light red to orange tips.</li>
            <li> no need to push hard or put more.</li>
            <li> I never really cared much or paid much attention to &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products although my sister had sworn by them for years....</li>
            <li> Hair feels smooth after useage, not too heavy and does not make hair greasy at any point during the day.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s soft and shines.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had enough time to really give it a go.</li>
            <li> Must have for Naturally Curly hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner was a complete wast of money.</li>
            <li> but I tried it and have used it 2 times so far</li>
            <li> Before, I would have had to straighten my hair and apply a styling oil for it to feel this soft.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair soft</li>
            <li> My hair feel so silky and soft after using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and shiny and does what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> These cheaper brand items fixed my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and shiny..really like it</li>
            <li> I also color my hair frequently.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so silky soft until I used</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li> This fixed my over processed and damaged hair within one week of use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft but also leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> Soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, manageable and feels a lot thicker to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li> Curls are completely gone</li>
            <li> So silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> when i do wash it out my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> I use it and it leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is not a leave-in conditioner - I do rinse it out - but it still makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> I think when it does wash out it pulls your natural vitamins out with it.</li>
            <li> If used as deep conditioner it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> This made my hair really soft and it felt healthier.</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally bleached and my ends look it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does seem to make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> Hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I like this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin&amp;#34; better than the regular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner.&amp;#34;  This stuff leaves my thick, coarse, &amp; wavy hair silkier &amp; more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, kinky/curly hair that has tons of fly aways and tends to look dried out.</li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner as far as making my hair feel good, but the smell is awful!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would be a good conditioner--there&#x27;s always a catch.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair prone to tangling, and it does a pretty good job of conditioning and removing tangles, though I recently upgraded to their conditioning MASK to use in lieu of this / regular conditioner</li>
            <li> this deep conditioner brought it right back to life</li>
            <li> Have very dry fine , long, colored hair.</li>
            <li> I put the deep conditioner in as leave-in conditioner (just a little everyday) and it makes my hair super silky and soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other cheaper plus keratin shampoos and conditioners to see if this is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I tried so many products in the past months but nothing brought it back to life like the</li>
            <li> So first, let me just say i am a platinum blonde and have been for 2 years, but recently i was experiencing SEVERE</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> Because I have fine hair, I only use this product once a week, then just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It was so soft and even shiny (which my hair isn&#x27;t until after i flat iron it after blow drying) and was even straighter than normal.</li>
            <li> I normally have a hay bale for a head of hair - and got a sample of this recently with another purchase - and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> Since it looks like conventional conditioner, I don&#x27;t know why it works better than conventional conditioner, but it does.  </li>
            <li> I have very long chemically treated hair and I see a very noticeable difference when I use the</li>
            <li> very helpful for my dry and over processed hair</li>
            <li> Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I have some dry ends and this really softens them.</li>
            <li> I have really fried dry damaged hair from bleach highlights.</li>
            <li> My old organix shampoo and conditioner that has always left my hair soft did not do the job anymore.</li>
            <li> had soft, lush hair and totally supple ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A small amount is good and I am not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The round pink 10 in this brand is way better</li>
            <li> I only leave it in my hair for about 5-7 minutes and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m crazy about hair products and when I first starting using this and the leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> When I first got this I used every other wash (about twice a week).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know any other product that can do that much!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s some of the major offenders:&lt;br /&gt;Silicones</li>
            <li> I have always chemically straightened it so it has gone through major damage.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse dry frizzy hair that I overbleached last year and tried so many different shampoos and conditioners, most of them expensive organic brands</li>
            <li> The directions are not like regular conditioner: You towel dry your hair first, section it, put the conditioner in, then brush it.</li>
            <li> It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have hair that often tucks into my pants (so long that the oils from my sccalp rarely reach the ends) and it  is very dry.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the leave-in spray worked so well that I decided to try the conditioner and its amazing.  </li>
            <li> Have a larger size pump version now because I went through this tube version so fast with long hair.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioning effect well enough, but would never contemplate buying again because of the headache-inducing, far too heavy-handed perfume.</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter has blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I only used it on my ends though because I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m over-doing it especially since this says it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, but again, now that I really need it, I don&#x27;t think the deep conditioning part is over-doing it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that it has eliminated my monthly&lt;br /&gt;end trimmings and put a stop to daily snags in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it now every time I wash my hair (about twice a week) because no regular conditioner leaves my hair as soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I went crazy trying to find a product that was just as good and didn&#x27;t cost a billion dollars.</li>
            <li> With medium heat on the hair dryer, I consistently run fingers through and down my hair trying to provide non-partisan assurance to each section of my hair awaiting its turn.</li>
            <li> I have long, dry hair, &amp; use a hot curling iron to style.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it in the shower, it didn&#x27;t feel any different than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> The other products are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used where I can let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I dabbed it on while it was almost dry and used it as smoother/styling product that my crazy hair (super processed and with split ends) finally looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out.</li>
            <li> Because it never hurts to condition your hair and this product is a part of the shampoo in the same brand, I do believe I will continue to use it because I&#x27;m left with soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li> While I do like what it does for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do enough to be worth the money for that few uses.</li>
            <li> It totally softens you hair like no other.</li>
            <li> The only major difference I can tell is that my hair is softer.</li>
            <li> , yes, I think this keratin alters my color to a certain extent, but the benefits of how it improves the quality and actual condition of my hair makes me continue to use this about every other hair wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it is a great condioner, however I think this was used and returned, the tube had very little in it, disappointed !</li>
            <li> My hair is usually completely normal, but it&#x27;s been dry recently.</li>
            <li> It actually works just as a general conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have really long (naturally wavy</li>
            <li> After using this the first time I couldn’t tell any difference, than I used it again for a second time and didn’t notice anything, to me it is not worth the money or the extra min or two in the shower!</li>
            <li> I was actually not getting the miracle by rinsing it out as apparently everyone else does.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty dried out and damaged on the ends because I&#x27;ve used bleach.  </li>
            <li> and it really weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> The dry brittle ends from winter heating season were magically fixed.</li>
            <li> It saves my bleach blonde hair after a salon treatment by stopping snapping, healing split ends, and putting moisture back into my hair in general.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about the price, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair began falling out and breaking off in little pieces, littering my sink after brushing my hair, no matter how gentle I detangled.</li>
            <li> I use a little dab on my ends every night after my shower and my hair looks and feels so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I would recommend leaving the conditioner in a little longer than they recommend about 10ish mins to really give it a chance to work.</li>
            <li> [no water turned on, I now squeeze about 2-peas&#x27; worth into my hand, then stretch my hands throughout my still wet hair [yes, I&#x27;m a little chilly without warm water</li>
            <li> im inlove with this product and will continue to use it 1ce a month because i heard toomuch of a good thing is bad</li>
            <li> it really helped I have frizzy thick tangly hair severely damaged because I was maintaining red hair it didn&#x27;t completely fix my hair after a week</li>
            <li> (as I said above) it has a very thick and rich consistency.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your hair feel less dry and healthier.  </li>
            <li> blonde highlights &amp; flat iron use) and</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from constant coloring and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Im a mixed african american female 17, and i have dry semi brittle</li>
            <li> conditioner is thick, high quality, and leaves hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> it is very pricey however for such a small container.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times to know how much to put on the hair for how long.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner left my hair dry, frizzy, and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> really well, a small amount can cover a lot of area when lathered</li>
            <li> It has helped to comb out my hair after washing, and using a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li> When in the shower, water gets into the cap no matter how it is placed (upright or flat).</li>
            <li> I actually think this, in the long run, dries your hair out.</li>
            <li> The only downside is I used up the tube with 3 uses for my long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair had no movement, even after deep conditioning and allowing to air dry.</li>
            <li> If the environment around the hair is drier than the hair, the humectants can possibly push moisture from the hair to the dry air to help balance the moisture in the atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Ill be going back to my cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s only coating it on the outside and not really repairing it</li>
            <li> (I have my hair highlighted with color not the usual highlighting stuff that can be so damaging to my hair and turn it white since I&#x27;m a natural blonde.)  </li>
            <li> I tried this after researching products as I was getting desperate for something to make my hair look better.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on in the shower as long as I can before washing it out.</li>
            <li> Its a supermarket product, not professional, I don like it.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the product every wash because my hair is really long.</li>
            <li> her hair is silver grey...</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is damaged from dying and medications.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, defines my curls not greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is straight and thick</li>
            <li> I could see this being slightly too heavy for those with very fine or thin hair because</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and long and it gets really dry.</li>
            <li> It sort of repairs my hair rather than further damage which I observed happened with other cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with other deep conditioners like Macadamia masks etc.</li>
            <li> Will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I alternate my shampoo, conditioners and other products each time</li>
            <li> As I wash and blow dry my hair every day, it was getting really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> The smell is pungent &amp; lingers on your hair when dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel  sillky after years of dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry before using this product.</li>
            <li> I continue drying with non-bristle brush until it&#x27;s about 90% dry throughout.</li>
            <li> I continue drying with non-bristle brush until it&#x27;s about 90% dry throughout.</li>
            <li> My hair was still dry and frizzy after using this.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile my hair starts to get really dry.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my ends were really dry</li>
            <li> I have a dry color treated hair .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> I also use the leave in miracle conditioner and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> so it is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> This product used with the shampoo does wonders for moisturizing dry split ends and over processed hair.</li>
            <li> If I towel dry my hair after using this because I don&#x27;t have time to use a dryer</li>
            <li> If you have dry damaged bleached to the max hair</li>
            <li> Cimant Thermique\\&quot; pre-blow dry.  </li>
            <li> hair dry yet greasy looking...</li>
            <li> Having the bottle in the shower made my hands messy with the color of the blue and red printing from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner actually was too softening and left my hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Instead of about 10-15 minutes on combing her hair, I spend about 1-2 minutes getting out every single knot.  </li>
            <li> and I can run the comb through my shoulder length hair without a single snarl.</li>
            <li> I use the leave in conditioner every single day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair long, past my mid back, so</li>
            <li> Every other product I used made my hair flat or unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Bed head dumb blonde reconstructor and shampoo.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;ve spent a long day in the pool.</li>
            <li> Put conditioner in your hair FIRST, on dry hair even, if you can manage it, and leave it in for at least a few minutes.</li>
            <li> the ends are so dry and brittle!</li>
            <li> It made my hair kinda rough not as soft as the usual stuff I use.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again - it helps that it won&#x27;t be a while since you use much less when keeping it on rather than rinsing out.</li>
            <li> my hair is very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair (</li>
            <li> but my hair is still very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> leaves hair with nothing to offer, no changes, no special moisturizing, no overall changes at all.</li>
            <li> For 20 dollars for such little conditioner you would think it would work.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Little blue flecks are in my hair, my shower stall, and on my hands just from handling the tube to get some product out.  </li>
            <li> when ever I have a little extra spending cash.</li>
            <li> you only need a little.</li>
            <li> My stylist mentioned my dry, tangled hair (and I use other high-quality products).</li>
            <li> I will say if you use too much near the roots, it can be hard to wash out and leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that the plastic tube is made of really cheap and bad printing quality.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for someone with long hair that they highlight year round!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so this small 5oz bottle only lasts me for 5-6 washes.  </li>
            <li> it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> not as much as i expected</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just not much product for the price and because of that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have tried It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> This was expensive, and wasnt worth the price.</li>
            <li> and OMG this product has transformed my hair in only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times my hair was heavy but looked and felt like straw.</li>
            <li> However,  I do still feel like it dulls my hair highlight color job.  </li>
            <li> Not drastic, but enough to notice since the color was just done a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Most annoying is the fact that the blue paint starts to come off as the tube is used.  </li>
            <li> the less, this product gets the #1 spot in my long list of hair masks ive gone through</li>
            <li> A little bit also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have thick, long hair as I do, you will get like 3 uses out of this entire 5 oz.</li>
            <li> Well, my usual hairdresser was not available last time, and though they swore up and down that the formula for highlighting my hair was the same, uh, I can attest that it was not.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and dry and my hair feels weightless when I use this deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my hair for 4 yrs now~Will not use any other</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that suggested to do a hair wrap and keep it in for 20 minutes and saran wrap....</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Looking around at the sandy landscape nearby, they smugly stay somewhat green so long as I can keep taking showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking around at the sandy landscape nearby, they smugly stay somewhat green so long as I can keep taking showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of the shower filter advertisements descriptions say they will reduce Chlorine but do not mention the other two, If they removed them they would put that in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used other conditioners with similiar results.</li>
            <li> and I will buy their other products.</li>
            <li> only a few week&#x27;s use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
            <li> This is only a 5oz bottle and cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like going as short as I usually do this time, so</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount once a week</li>
            <li> If you read my other comment, I can&#x27;t help but repeat myself...</li>
            <li> I am going to try out some other products.</li>
            <li> I purchase the product based on a friend’s recommendation and other reviews - it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make my hair oily like other products do.  </li>
            <li> Only a very few will filter out Monochloramines, some water companies use that instead Chlorine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair and flat iron it every single day, in addition to getting color, highlights and lowlights.</li>
            <li> ONLY HARD THING FOR ME IS TO WAIT THE 2-5 MINUTES BEFORE RINSING IT OUT</li>
            <li> little on the expensive side, $15 for 5 oz is pretty steep for conditioner</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$$$$.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and dark blond.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really love it or hate it</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair that frizzes in humidity and</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I want on my thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated, gray hair.  </li>
            <li> But this left my hair heavy feeling and very dried out.</li>
            <li> over and over running through sections and coupling the mass into patted down piles.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> With washcloth in hand I move down the shower walls and glass doors, squeezing residue water into the bucket each time</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> - anything ending in -cone, -conol, -col, or -xane is not water-soluble and thus cause build-up that weigh curls down, diminishing definition.</li>
            <li> So moisturizing without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> (I probably won&#x27;t buy this again until the price goes down, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It does not weight the hair down.</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner with the leave in treatment and this is the softest my hair has been in a very, very long time!!!!  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> Because of this product I spend less time getting all the knots out and having her cry while combing her hair.  </li>
            <li> For the past 2 years, I was hooked on H2O&#x27;s Milk hair conditioner, and then it suddenly disappeared from every store shelf known to man :/</li>
            <li> It is softer, less brittle and even has a shine to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer, smoother, and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> but next time I will try other seller.the delivery was very slow.</li>
            <li> I recently went from red colored hair to platinum blond, and needless to say my hair was a little fried.</li>
            <li> Daughter has extemely damaged hair from over processing and was always a matted mess.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> , I have really long thick hair and didn&#x27;t think this would work on me.</li>
            <li> But, after the 2nd and 3rd uses I became less and less crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the exorbitant price I practically had to take out a loan to pay for, it is loaded with ingredients that are not only bad for the condition of curly hair (and perhaps straight hair, too), some are not particularly safe for the skin.</li>
            <li> and my scalp was a little oily.</li>
            <li> When my hair is a little frizzy, I put a little in, and it makes my hair AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> but it is pricey for the little bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this and the shampoo with a little of the spray before drying.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not very impressed with is the price.</li>
            <li> the product is too little to use for my everyday conditioner, hence the 1 star off.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I ultimately have had to cut it, but this stuff did help with some of the damage prior to cutting it.</li>
            <li> Did not smooth my hair nor add shine, nor soften, it just made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was using it everyday</li>
            <li> Leaves hair heavy, greasy and doesn&#x27;t repair or protect hair.</li>
            <li> I carry each bucket of water to the few remaining trees, bushes, and flowering plants or shrubs.</li>
            <li> I carry each bucket of water to the few remaining trees, bushes, and flowering plants or shrubs.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not as heavy as leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After hearing her talk about it a few times, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> bad)&lt;br /&gt;I went online and found a shower filter that removed the Chlorine and Chloramines and the heavy metals from my water and installed them onto my shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an everyday conditioner, but I use it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> and I was annoyed, but the next day it was</li>
            <li> It may be a bit too harsh?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think any conditioner would be harsh but it feels that way until I wash it again.</li>
            <li> - it is heavy in humectants, which are made to pull moisture into the hair and retain it.</li>
            <li> This was way to heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer you can always just sit with a plastic cap and use a hand blow dryer for a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try buying a cheaper everyday keratin conditioner and use the</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will post an update after I use it a few times.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes a difference to my hair that were dried after color treatment.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d look into prolonging the life of my poor, suffering hair with a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package was broken open and leaking.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes after shampooing and rinse with coolish water.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is alot healthier and has grown alot, but it is still alittle damaged because i straighten my hair almost everyday, dye it 1ce a month or once every 2 months, plus me trying to grow it</li>
            <li> Also, I noticeably have much less split ends!</li>
            <li> I have extremely course, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to let you in on a little secret, I did some research on line about what causes your hair and skin to dry out like it does.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair that I straighten</li>
            <li> but I could probably get the same results from a less expensive product</li>
            <li> After purchasing the first time, I guess I forgot just how bad it smelled, so I purchased it again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal - I often keep my hair short anyway, so I just chop it off when it gets annoyingly bad and wait a few weeks to grow it out again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but it is very expensive</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my hair without weighing it down or feeling greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used shampoos and conditioners that add shine - but they all unfortunately add weight and the general look of being unclean.  </li>
            <li> usage is a little unconventional, but it works so well!</li>
            <li> I use this during my shower process and have noticed a little difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> After moving to a place with hard water, my dyed hair began to react to the harsh water.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and you leave on for a few minutes .  </li>
            <li> No more tangles just hair</li>
            <li> I bought this in a pinch when I couldn&#x27;t get a hold of my usual Paul Mitchell keratin rinse.  </li>
            <li> No more frizz and feeling like a bail of straw.</li>
            <li> I am unable to sense any extra conditioning of my hair after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I read about 10 Miracle in a beauty magazine and found the leave-in spray at a local drug store (its was expensive</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the small 4oz bottle).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference, I just know it works</li>
            <li> in the past so thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a ton, so don&#x27;t be alarmed at the small size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help my hair grow since it has keratin in it, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I use small amount every time after I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> , so I changed from my usual keratin shampoo and conditioner to try this</li>
            <li> Anyone who rates it less than 5 stars is crazy because i have tried everything, including the overly-raved about macadamia oil deep repair mask and that stuff doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> I have very heavily processed hair from color dying every 3 months or so</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it were less expensive!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m thinking if someone with thin hair used it it would weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> had dull brittle hair, and at the end of this 5 minute treatment&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product is also a little thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for stupid *beep*es who already have silky, no tangled, straight, non-danaged hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> This conditioner lasts for at least two months.</li>
            <li> At least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> At least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m running late, my hair is still manageable -</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner at least 2x a week and immediately noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> i have thick hair that is wavy</li>
            <li> leaves a thick film on my scalp</li>
            <li> No more scare crow straw hair!</li>
            <li> and i mean SEVERE breakage.</li>
            <li> If your hair is fired, toasted, cripsy when dry, gummy, sticky when wet, and severly damaged to the point that stupid *</li>
            <li> And finding a bigger bottle is nearly impossible.  </li>
            <li> and i seriously recommend them to anyone with damaged hair, it has returned the strength to my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In, cause that stuff seriously changes your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT thrilled in the least!</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I had to buy another tube which is a little expensive for me to keep up.</li>
            <li> and it is not good for this hair type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are dry, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I do have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick and course hair.</li>
            <li> I had to use a LOT of this product on my hair because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve never seen him blown over by a hair product!</li>
            <li> It immediately helped my poor hair.</li>
            <li> My mother in her 80&#x27;s even loves this product, and she has thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer</li>
            <li> my broken hairline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until I got desperate with all of the breakage I was experiencing with my poor over processed and blow dried hair that something had to give!</li>
            <li> but I can still see and feel a dramatic difference from before i started using it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair, and annoying that you are supposed to towel dry your hair before applying.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair product on the market for thin hair, including expensive salon products like D&#x27;Avines and infomercial products like Wen.</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s a 2 for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe its because is fake.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try it.</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I used to get this CRAZY tangles behind my neck but</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive for what it is</li>
            <li> I keep having to pet myself even though my husband is giving me weird looks.</li>
            <li> I was so confused!...</li>
            <li> Not impressed...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair NEEDS all the conditioning it can get.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> (I have almost no more frizz when my hair air drys!!!!).</li>
            <li> This is a fancy looking expensive poor quality VO5 crap conditioner.</li>
            <li> Would be hard to find a replacement!!!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in the waste of money.</li>
            <li> These products are cheaper than this useless expensive crap.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It can be very expensive in the grocery stores.</li>
            <li> When Philosophy stopped making Hair Conditioner I was very sad.  </li>
            <li> Boy do I feel dumb!!!</li>
            <li> and i bet you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed</li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> and if I forget to use it one day I hate the feel and look of my hair these people writing bad reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> The water quality in this country is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this product. Totally worth every penny too.</li>
            <li> I have my hair colored-- I have a lot of hightlights. As I wash and blow dry my hair every day, it was getting really dry and brittle. After i wash  my hair I now condition it with this deep conditioner, comb it thru my hair while i am in the shower and rince it out WELL. My hair has never been in such great condition.!!! ANOTHER THANKS TO IT&#x27;S A TEN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After moving to a place with hard water, my dyed hair began to react to the harsh water. My old organix shampoo and conditioner that has always left my hair soft did not do the job anymore. My hair began falling out and breaking off in little pieces, littering my sink after brushing my hair, no matter how gentle I detangled. The ends were straw-like and no amount of product could seal them. My hair had no movement, even after deep conditioning and allowing to air dry. It would just almost matt together because of the damage. A friend suggested this conditioner and it changed everything. When I first applied it in the shower, it didn&#x27;t feel any different than other conditioners. But when I rinsed it out, my hair was silky soft and easily detangled. The best part is that this conditioner leaves a protective coating on the hair, that when heat is applied, it seals the shaft, leaving hair glossy, silky, and almost virgin-like. The ends looked like they had been freshly trimmed, and I could run my hands through my hair with no snags or breakage. I will say if you use too much near the roots, it can be hard to wash out and leave hair greasy. It takes a few times to know how much to put on the hair for how long. I have since bought the matching shampoo and products containing keratin, because it simply WORKS. This product has given me the faith I needed to think my hair can grow out long and beautiful again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked for life.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner - my stylist pretty much demanded I use what she did - and it makes my hair so much easier to come through and softer to the tough.  This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> very helpful for my dry and over processed hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as other products.  The other products are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect looks like my hair original. It match with my style. no need to push hard or put more. just leave it and you will get good aspect</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have wavy hair and struggle to keep it moisturized. This product really helps condition it and keep it manageable and help control the frizz. Recommend this to anyone looking for a deep conditioner that works!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  Wish it came in a bigger container.  My hair is pretty dried out and damaged on the ends because I&#x27;ve used bleach.  This left my hair looking like I got a recent trim.  My ends didn&#x27;t look split and my hair is SUPER soft.  I do have very thick hair, I&#x27;m thinking if someone with thin hair used it it would weigh it down.  But I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Love all there products</li>
            <li> This is a solid conditioner overall. I&#x27;ve used all the major high end brands, and I would say this stands up just as well as products I&#x27;ve used from Bumble and Bumble, Davines, etc. Hair feels smooth after useage, not too heavy and does not make hair greasy at any point during the day. I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this product for comparable performance to the higher end brands at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After only one use, I can see a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s smoother and shinier and no fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Seems like regular conditioner. Nothing special. Purchased because the IT&#x27;S A 10. Leave-in conditioner is so fantastic!! I recommend buying that instead..</li>
            <li> Went out on a limb her to buy hair product on the internet, but so glad I did!</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel and smells great..makes hair softer and tames fly aways</li>
            <li> The  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a  10&amp;#34;  products are all excellent.  My hair responds beautifully to them and I keep reordering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product twice now. I liked the conditioner as far as making my hair feel good, but the smell is awful!  After purchasing the first time, I guess I forgot just how bad it smelled, so I purchased it again.  The smell is pungent &amp; lingers on your hair when dry.  I will not be buying this product again until \\&quot;its a 10\\&quot; works out their fragrance issues.  Cheap 1970s mens cologne isnt the scent Im going for. Why make a great product &amp; then make it stink? it&#x27;s beyond me.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I used every other wash (about twice a week).  I now use once a week along with the miracle shine spray and my long hair is silky and smooth! I shampoo as normal then comb this through my hair in the shower and leave in for 5 mins. I thought at first my hair was a little greasy after using, but then realized that is how smooth hair feels like.  Would definitely recommend for someone with long hair that they highlight year round!</li>
            <li> After using the product you can see a difference on you&#x27;re hair it&#x27;s softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my hair for 4 yrs now~Will not use any other~A must have if you color or bleach your hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is straight and thick and it is not good for this hair type. Did not smooth my hair nor add shine, nor soften, it just made my hair greasy. Sadly it&#x27;s a 2 for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever purchased and I have tried many. The conditioner is thick and you leave on for a few minutes .  It totally softens you hair like no other. I&#x27;m sold on it. My hair is dry and gets frizzy easily.  This conditioner really lives up to its name.  Definitely worth a try,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say I&#x27;ve seen some real results, but I can&#x27;t.  Maybe, you need to try more than one bottle to see a miracle!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this as I&#x27;ve witnessed the magic of keratin on my hair before. I have shorter hair now and it&#x27;s super healthy, but this stuff made it dry. I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> It is just amazing!! My hear became look so healthy!</li>
            <li> I have long, dry hair, &amp; use a hot curling iron to style.  This conditioner makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Loved it nothing like it befote always have to have!!! It makes my hair feel  sillky after years of dry hair</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; great price</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my hair without weighing it down or feeling greasy and thick. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is good but it is a little heavy for my fine hair.  A small amount is good and I am not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Does a very decent job of coating the hair and giving it some bounce, but the *perfume*, to me, kills this product. The scent, which I find deeply disagreeable to begin with, is incredibly cloying and overpowering. This would be so much better without the perfume. It almost seems as if the scent chemicals constitute the majority of this conditioner, and if you read the list of ingredients, that may be very close to the truth indeed. I like the conditioning effect well enough, but would never contemplate buying again because of the headache-inducing, far too heavy-handed perfume.</li>
            <li> After some time not using conditioner on my hair, this product is being wonderful in recovering the dullness &amp; dryness.  My hair feels softer after every wash. Smells great too! Good investment.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for repairing your hair but if you have curly hair it will take the curl right out!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the smoothness that I like from a conditioner. No more tangles just hair that&#x27;s soft and shines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years and love it. The price is great on Amazon and you can&#x27;t beat the free shipping with prime. I usually buy a few at a time. I use this conditioner once a week as a treatment.</li>
            <li> I tried this &amp; it was ok. I prefer to use the Its a 10 hair mask a couple times a week. This stuff is $15 a bottle &amp; I was using it everyday bc my hair is very dry so it goes fast. My regular go to conditioner is Redken Butter Treat which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I like this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin&amp;#34; better than the regular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner.&amp;#34;  This stuff leaves my thick, coarse, &amp; wavy hair silkier &amp; more manageable.  The Keratin is tenth on the ingredient list, so i doubt there is even that much in there, but my hair likes this stuff better.</li>
            <li> I never really cared much or paid much attention to &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products although my sister had sworn by them for years....Until I got desperate with all of the breakage I was experiencing with my poor over processed and blow dried hair that something had to give! I read the reviews and gave in....Boy do I feel dumb!!! Had  I only listened to my sister years ago my hair would have been gorgeous such a long time ago!!! I read other reviews that suggested to do a hair wrap and keep it in for 20 minutes and saran wrap....haven&#x27;t tried it....But I can&#x27;t wait!! I have tried it the last couple of weeks for approx. 5 minutes while in the shower and it never seems to disappoint. Maybe this weekend I will try it for the 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 1/2 years. Leaves hair heavy, greasy and doesn&#x27;t repair or protect hair. Not worth the $$$$$$.  I found Tresemme Platinum Strength in Walmart, saved Aston of cash and my hair is SO much better without this!!!!!</li>
            <li> This makes your hair soft. I was having problems with breaking hair and tangles-- too much overprocessing! This works great. I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> Does okay. not as much as i expected</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says!  Great conditioner!  My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, dry hair. I know this is pricy but a little goes a long way! This conditioner is hydrating and definitely worth it. I bought this and the mask and use this once a week and the mask once a month. My hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am in Love with this conditioner. It smells absolutely amazing and keeps My waist length hair manageable and shiny. I will definitely continue to purchase it</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry before using this product. Now my hair is super silky and smooth. I love that I only have to use so little to get great results. This conditioner lasts for at least two months.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff and worth the money if you have naturally curly/frizzy hair, highlighted, colored or dried hair or drying, aging hair. I introduced my husband to it and he stole mine! He won&#x27;t start a day without it nor will he travel w/o it. I mean, I&#x27;ve never seen him blown over by a hair product! But as for me, my hairdresser introduced me to it. It will do a great job no matter which technique you use (as I&#x27;ve seen many commenters describe their processes). However, the following is my protocol:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After shampooing, I stop the shower and move my gray-water collecting buckets about, pushing a full one to the rear.&lt;br /&gt;2. With a fresh/empty bucket in place underneath the shower head [no water turned on, I now squeeze about 2-peas&#x27; worth into my hand, then stretch my hands throughout my still wet hair [yes, I&#x27;m a little chilly without warm water but this is California] over and over running through sections and coupling the mass into patted down piles.&lt;br /&gt;3. This will have taken about 60-90 seconds, so now I turn the warm water back on while collecting the run-off as I did during the bathing shower and the shampoo cycle of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4. I give it a light rinse at best, then turn the water off and admire the buckets of gray water I&#x27;ve saved.&lt;br /&gt;5. With washcloth in hand I move down the shower walls and glass doors, squeezing residue water into the bucket each time (typically that&#x27;s 4 good squeezes)&lt;br /&gt;6. Gingerly stepping through and over the buckets, I leave the shower and with towel, wrap my hair in a turban fashion, not rubbing it with the towel before hand.&lt;br /&gt;7. I keep this towel on while my ablutions continue and then I begin to dress. Only then do I start to unwrap my hair letting it acclimate to the air before combing or parting, but not for more than 15 minutes or my hair will start to curl up.&lt;br /&gt;8. With medium heat on the hair dryer, I consistently run fingers through and down my hair trying to provide non-partisan assurance to each section of my hair awaiting its turn. Then I stop for 5-10 minutes, continue dressing, while my hair thinks things over and decides to cooperate for the greater good.&lt;br /&gt;9. I continue drying with non-bristle brush until it&#x27;s about 90% dry throughout. That&#x27;s good enough for just about anybody.&lt;br /&gt;10. I carry each bucket of water to the few remaining trees, bushes, and flowering plants or shrubs. Looking around at the sandy landscape nearby, they smugly stay somewhat green so long as I can keep taking showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a Great Hair Product and a Recommendation for Water Repurposing wherever you live, because if you&#x27;re not experiencing a drought this year, you might be next year. We&#x27;re all in this together! Come on, save that Gray Water, Carry those Buckets and do your part!nce to each section of my hair awaiting its turn.

            <li> love it and it came quickly</li>
            <li> SMOOTH FEEL TO DRY HAIR. ONLY HARD THING FOR ME IS TO WAIT THE 2-5 MINUTES BEFORE RINSING IT OUT</li>
            <li> This product, along with the plus keratin shampoo, is great, but a bit pricy. I will be trying other cheaper plus keratin shampoos and conditioners to see if this is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product was very lightweight. I expected more than what the product provided at this price. It is a good product but I could probably get the same results from a less expensive product</li>
            <li> I am an admitted hair abuser. I bleach, I dye, I don&#x27;t treat it well, and mine is super fine butt length hair. Right now it&#x27;s dark red, light red to orange tips. This stuff makes my hair feel like silk. I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle because I go through a lot (lots of hair, condition 6 times a week as opposed to shampooing 3 times a week) so I&#x27;ve had enough time to really give it a go. I&#x27;ve used a ton of different deep conditioners, and some do ok. This one blew me away. Definitely give it a try if you bleach or dye your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I&#x27;m only giving it four stars instead of five because I wish they sold it in the same size bottle as the shampoo, I always have to buy two bottles of conditioner and I still run out of it before the shampoo! Overall, this product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. My hair was so smooth and soft, and much cheaper than purchasing at a store or salon. Normally I don&#x27;t think expensive brands actually work better, and opt for the cheaper store brands, but I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this deep condtioner! I use this about 2-3 times per week to help with heat damage. I leave it on in the shower as long as I can before washing it out. It leaves my hair soft and smooth. Love this product!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t  until after the 3rd time I used the product that I noticed the difference in my hair.  My hair had a lot of breakage but is getting stronger every time I use this conditioner!  I will keep using it- great stuff.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this and Deva Concepts had the best price.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair (blonde highlights &amp; flat iron use) and this is one of the best conditioners I have tried. This was a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner, so I gave this deep conditioner a try. It is a good sized bottle that lasts a while if used once a week. It does leave the hair feeling soft right after, but my hair is still dry &amp; frizzy the next day, so not the best.</li>
            <li> my hair is getting softer and more manageable,i used the silk conditioner but this is helping greatly too,i like it a lot</li>
            <li> I thank the Ulta store in Jackson TN consultants for recommending me this hair care and &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products. I bought the full set and very happy with it. I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much. This product gave me silky, healthy-looking hair and I highly recommend it....and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The best conditions I have used. Don&#x27;t need it every time you wash your hair. It puts the life back into your hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but just not enough to drop that much money again.</li>
            <li> Must have for Naturally Curly hair</li>
            <li> I love this product ..but next time I will try other seller.the delivery was very slow. Really good product , it leaves your hair very silky.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! cheaper online than in store!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was a complete wast of money. It did absolutley NOTHING for my hair. My hair was still dry and frizzy after using this. I was better off using my $4 Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  However I am deducting a star for the cost.  I have really long hair, so this small 5oz bottle only lasts me for 5-6 washes.  And finding a bigger bottle is nearly impossible.  The product works very well when used in conjunction with the It&#x27;s a 10 Shampoo and Leave-In Potion.  I have tried using the Leave-In Potion when using another conditioner, and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same great smooth and shiny effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a pinch when I couldn&#x27;t get a hold of my usual Paul Mitchell keratin rinse.  I can&#x27;t say that I like this more than that, but, it did a fine job at softening my hair and detangling it.  It also leaves behind a very pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> I typically use Pureology, Loma, Davines, and I have found this to be the absolute best.  Turns your hair into pure silk.  I have very thick and course hair.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how soft and healthy my hair is after using this.  I use less than the recommended amount and wash it out after less than a minute and it works great. Since it looks like conventional conditioner, I don&#x27;t know why it works better than conventional conditioner, but it does.  Also, it&#x27;s not as heavy as leave in conditioner.  I will be using more of this.</li>
            <li> We have well water so I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that would sufficiently moisturize my hair. My hair stylist suggested using this deep conditioner. The bottle says to leave it on your hair for 2-5 minutes and then to rinse it out of your hair. My hair stylist said to apply the conditioner, put a shower cap on, and to leave it in my hair for 15-20 minutes and then rinse. Wow!!! Does my hair feel and look great!! I also use the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in with Keratin and they don&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> Oh my god this stuff though! This is the best stuff I have tried. It morphs your hair into silky shiny new hair. I honestly can&#x27;t get over how well it works.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the high review. It actually works just as a general conditioner. I just bought hair oil, that seems works better to keep hair shine and smooth</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.  It was recommended to me by a blogger that I follow.  After hearing her talk about it a few times, I decided to go for it.  Love it.  Have already purchased more.  It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy through Amazon than most retail places. It you have Amazon Prime, you won&#x27;t even pay shipping.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this when I bought &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in plus kertain&amp;#34; and will never use another deep conditioner again. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and smells so yummy! I put it on my hair after i shampooed and squeeze the water out of my hair and left it on for the remainder of my shower and combed through it before i rinsed it out. I decided to for go blow drying my hair after using this just to see how my hair felt and it was amazing. It was so soft and even shiny (which my hair isn&#x27;t until after i flat iron it after blow drying) and was even straighter than normal. I didn&#x27;t have the little fly aways on the top of my head after I used this which was nice. I know that if i was in a rush and didn&#x27;t have time to dry my hair, that my hair would still look good if i went out somewhere. I would highly recommend buying this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used the it&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in conditioner a while back and it really weighed my hair down so I was skeptical to buy this even after all of the great reviews but I tried it and have used it 2 times so far and I love it! I have bright red hair that was being dyed every month for maintenance and my hair was very damaged and after getting it chopped off and multiple trims almost all of the damaged ends are gone but my hair is still very dry and I&#x27;ve tried just about every conditioner/leave in conditioner there is including argon oil deep repair mask and nothing has made my hair look and feel this great except this conditioner! I&#x27;m very satisfied. if you have damaged hair then you should definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> great transaction. Product as described</li>
            <li> Its a supermarket product, not professional, I don like it. Dont works like a profesional product. Maybe its because is fake.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile my hair starts to get really dry. For some reason, my ends were really dry and my scalp was a little oily. I started shampooing normally, and just using this conditioner as leave in after. I didn&#x27;t condition the way I normally do, but just put a pea sized amount in my hair after getting out of the shower. When my hair is a little frizzy, I put a little in, and it makes my hair AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usage is a little unconventional, but it works so well! My hair is now very healthy and frizz free. I don&#x27;t know any other product that can do that much!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good. It has helped to comb out my hair after washing, and using a flat iron on it. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try it. Thanks amazon for carrying it!!</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is amazing! My hair was very dull, dry and brittle and since I started to use this product once a week, I&#x27;ve had great results. My hair has shine and feels a lot softer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the the best deep conditioner that I have used, and the first time I used it, I followed all of the directions, and my hair felt so soft and silky after it dried. Before, I would have had to straighten my hair and apply a styling oil for it to feel this soft. This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I started using It&#x27;s a 10 products a couple months ago and I would never have believed the difference it would make.  I use this conditioner, and the accompanying keratin shampoo and keratin miracle oil, and for the first time in my life my hair is smooth and shiny. No more frizz and feeling like a bail of straw. I have NEVER in 55 years had SHINY hair.  But I do now. I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of it, it feels so great. I have bathrooms full of hair products I&#x27;ve tried to manage my curly, frizzy hair, and I can throw them all away now.  I won&#x27;t be switching again.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. I&#x27;m a product junky so I love trying different products. The only thing I&#x27;m not very impressed with is the price. I have natural curly hair and a lot of it, so I use a good amount of conditioner when I shower. There&#x27;s just not much product for the price and because of that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. (Unless I find a really good deal)</li>
            <li> There is such a difference when I use this. A friend told me about this and I have been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Pricey but it works. It lasts a while because you don&#x27;t need to use that much for it to be effective. I like the packaging; the squeeze tube is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviewers here who have given it a five-star. I would like to add that though it is more expensive than most regular conditioners, but it turned out to be relatively much cheaper since 1) I use it much much less frequently, it really has a very nice effect on my hair which lasts much longer. 2) It sort of repairs my hair rather than further damage which I observed happened with other cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love love love these products. I now buy them if the larger sizes because they are great for my problem hair.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> I have tried It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin for a few months now.  It is for sure a miracle in a tube.  The conditioner keeps my very frizzy hair in line and works well in detangling all the knots.  I particularly bought this product because of my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s very curly hair.  Because of this product I spend less time getting all the knots out and having her cry while combing her hair.  Instead of about 10-15 minutes on combing her hair, I spend about 1-2 minutes getting out every single knot.  Her hair is very smooth and cuts down on the frizz.  I bought this product because of the hairstylist that I went to suggested it and I just fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> An amazing cream that smells and conditions very nice and the price for the oz is perfect. I plan on buying some shampoo and other items for my hair cuz it&#x27;s such a great deal. Thank u</li>
            <li> Comparable price after shipment is accessed.  Product is good because of who it is - great product.  Did arrive before estimated which was a plus.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I love it.It really makes your hair feel and look so healthy. I plan to keep using their products, they work so much better than a lot of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> i love all their products. great conditioner</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for swimmers and generally dry haired folks. I love it and would have bought it in gallon sized if I could have.</li>
            <li> Not in love with this one. I love a lot of It&#x27;s a 10 products but this does nothing for me. It made my hair kinda rough not as soft as the usual stuff I use. Which is their silk serum, which I love because it can be used for so much and makes the hair crazies go away.</li>
            <li> used twice, have to use quite a bit--- won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;but I didn&#x27;t see that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I am going to let you in on a little secret, I did some research on line about what causes your hair and skin to dry out like it does. And it always comes back to the water you are using to shower or bath in. The water quality in this country is terrible. Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water. Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin. And your breathing in the mist into your lungs while taking a shower. (that&#x27;s bad)&lt;br /&gt;I went online and found a shower filter that removed the Chlorine and Chloramines and the heavy metals from my water and installed them onto my shower. Within three days I could feel the difference in my hair and skin. I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out. Using these good quality shampoos and conditioners along with the shower filter makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin. That was like icing on the cake. Even at my age my hair is soft and shinny. I cant believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to purchase a shower filter contact your local water company and talk to the water quality section to find out what they use to purify the water. Then check on the company website of the shower filter you are thinking of buying to see what the shower filter will reduce or eliminate, you might have to call the filter company as they don&#x27;t always say what they &amp;#34;wont&amp;#34; filter out. Only a very few will filter out Monochloramines, some water companies use that instead Chlorine. Some use Chloramine and some use both Chlorine and Chloramine like my water company. A lot of the shower filter advertisements descriptions say they will reduce Chlorine but do not mention the other two, If they removed them they would put that in their advertisement. Check before purchasing, you might think that the filter you bought is protecting you when in reality it is not filtering anything.﻿two, If they removed them they would put that in their advertisement.

            <li> Great for mixed hair!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and I can run the comb through my shoulder length hair without a single snarl.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.  It does make my hair soft but I&#x27;ve used other conditioners with similiar results. Nothing special. Don&#x27;t really love it or hate it, it&#x27;s just ok for me.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an everyday conditioner, but I use it just about everyday. It makes my hair shiny and allows me to curl it more easily. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again. The seller was quick too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product that works so amazingly well. Perfect for fine hair, or any type of hair. I can really feel the difference almost immediately after my hair is dried.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner!  My hair feels so very soft and silky.  A friend suggested it to me.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of their hair products.</li>
            <li> This is a nice deep conditioner treatment but the fact that its keratin you have to watch out. I did this after I washed my hair and left it in for about 30 minutes. It was frizzy and not so great immediately and I was annoyed, but the next day it was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just found out about using keratin more and anything with it in it has to be used sparingly. If you use it too much you will have breakage. It&#x27;s apparently too much protein for the hair. Because of this I will not be buying this again. I felt it didn&#x27;t do anything that spectacular for me for the price and the fact I can only use it once a week. I will be sticking with other deep conditioners like Macadamia masks etc.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great conditioner, definitely one of the tops one I have used. I have very long, thick hair prone to tangling, and it does a pretty good job of conditioning and removing tangles, though I recently upgraded to their conditioning MASK to use in lieu of this / regular conditioner as it does an even better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is thick, high quality, and leaves hair feeling soft an moisturized. It works GREAT on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well. I could see this being slightly too heavy for those with very fine or thin hair because (as I said above) it has a very thick and rich consistency.</li>
            <li> After one time using this product there was a noticeable difference in my hair.  I have used it three times now and have experienced increased moisture and softness in my hair! No more scare crow straw hair! YAY!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love that this company makes paraben-free, sulfate-free products that also do not do animal testing.  I have extremely course, thick hair. And I&#x27;ve gotten a keratin treatment, so finding a product that all the aforementioned criteria PLUS keratin was not an easy task.  I was skeptical that it would be a good conditioner--there&#x27;s always a catch.  However, It&#x27;s a 10 works SO WELL for me.  My hair feel so silky and soft after using this conditioner.  It detangles and makes for overall great manageability.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I have it highlighted every 8 weeks. I am on the fence as to if it makes my hair feel more straw like than with the regular It&#x27;s a 10 daily conditioner... I think the extra protein ? may be what does it. It may be a bit too harsh? Didn&#x27;t think any conditioner would be harsh but it feels that way until I wash it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 2 years.  I get many complements on how my hair looks.  It is soft and shiny and does what I want it to do.  This is truly the best conditioner I have ever used.  Would be hard to find a replacement!!!</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy hair and nothing is able to keep my hair straight except this stuff! I have to leave it on for about 5 minutes for it to work but it&#x27;s  amazing!</li>
            <li> Because of the inordinate number of positive reviews about It&#x27;s a 10 Deep Conditioner Plus, I ignored the ingredients list and purchased it. Aside from the exorbitant price I practically had to take out a loan to pay for, it is loaded with ingredients that are not only bad for the condition of curly hair (and perhaps straight hair, too), some are not particularly safe for the skin. This deep conditioner left my hair dry, frizzy, and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some of the major offenders:&lt;br /&gt;Silicones - anything ending in -cone, -conol, -col, or -xane is not water-soluble and thus cause build-up that weigh curls down, diminishing definition. There are some really good silicones out there - ones with the prefix PPG or PEG come to mind (neither of which are found in this product).&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin - it is heavy in humectants, which are made to pull moisture into the hair and retain it. This doesn&#x27;t work unless weather conditions are virtually perfect.If the environment around the hair is drier than the hair, the humectants can possibly push moisture from the hair to the dry air to help balance the moisture in the atmosphere. It also notoriously fades hair color by dissolving and grabbing unbound dye molecules that are easily accessible near the exterior of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;There are other problems, too. There are many ingredients listed that cause skin irritation, and in some cases aggravating existing eczema problems. I should have known better, but I gave the benefit of the doubt because of all the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some frustration and a lot of money and invest in a deep conditioner that&#x27;s actually good for your tresses such as Garnier Fructis Fortifying Deep Conditioner - Sleek &amp; Shine 3 Minute Masque, Curl Junkie Curl Rehab Moisturizing Hair Treatment, or perhaps Bee Mine Bee-U-Ti-Ful Deep Conditioner. They all have high quality ingredients and are far more cost effective ranging from $.79/ounce compared to nearly $3/ounce for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious. At least there&#x27;s that. Unless you&#x27;re fragrance-sensitive./&gt;On a positive note, while quite strong, it smells luxurious. At least there&#x27;s that. Unless you&#x27;re fragrance-sensitive.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and the effect it has on my hair&lt;br /&gt;it is a good product, I recoment it</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my hair.....BUT for those of you worried about increasing the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; of your hair....you will have to wash it more often. For me it is worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoping... if I left it in my hair for 5 mins, my hair was soft. I used it all up and it did not help my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I put this in after shampooing with It&#x27;s a 10 and leave on before heat styling product.  My fly aways have pretty much disappeared and all of my hair is full and soft.... and ordinarily I have super fine, flat hair.  Recommend to any hair type and length, worth the money every ounce.</li>
            <li> This was expensive, and wasnt worth the price. I didnt see any difference in my hair at all. Ill be going back to my cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It immediately repaired my tangled and frizzy hair and the best part is that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to make it work.  The only thing I dislike is that the plastic tube is made of really cheap and bad printing quality. Having the bottle in the shower made my hands messy with the color of the blue and red printing from the bottle.  Hopefully, they will correct that defect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for my color treated hair.  My hair is also very fine and tangles easily.  This conditioner does a good job of moisturizing my hair, and i do not have any problems with tangles after washing my hair.  The conditioner also does not seem to weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> amazing I really love how soft and shinny my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner.  This was way to heavy for me.  I passed it on to a friend, and she hasn&#x27;t said she loved it so  I&#x27;m guessing she doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I love my soft hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, waist length fine hair, and this conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair very soft and shiny, I love it!</li>
            <li> I use This in combination with the shampoo and it&#x27;s the best!! So moisturizing without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Repairs dry, damaged, colored hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It makes your hair super soft and easy to comb through.  Great hair product, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for a while now and love it. Makes a difference from first time use.</li>
            <li> On one hand, I love this product.  I absolutely love what it does for my hair.  On the other hand, if you have thick, long hair as I do, you will get like 3 uses out of this entire 5 oz. bottle.  While I do like what it does for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t do enough to be worth the money for that few uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deep conditioner for a few months now and it truly is the best deep conditioner I have ever used! And I am a product junkie with a TON of products in the closet that just didn&#x27;t make the cut for me. My hair is naturally very curly and extremely frizzy, the kind that poofs into a fuzz ball when it dries! I have always chemically straightened it so it has gone through major damage. This deep conditioner smells wonderful to me and makes my hair super soft and way much stronger!! I can noticeably feel and see the healthy difference in my hair, and the keratin is what really helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share with you all how I use it because this really helps magnify the affect on my hair. I put it in my hair in the shower and comb it through thoroughly, then cover it with a plastic cap/shower cap and sit under a hooded dryer for 20 minutes. That&#x27;s how you would get a deep conditioner in a salon which many of you might identify with also! The heat really helps the product work better, and I have both leaving it in for  just 5 minutes and rinsing it as well as the 20 minute with heat method and there is a huge difference. If you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer you can always just sit with a plastic cap and use a hand blow dryer for a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also very different than the It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask if anyone is trying to compare! I have been using both of them for months but for different reasons. If your hair is very damaged and you&#x27;re looking for something to help make it healthy again this deep conditioner is good for you, whereas if your hair is in good condition but very dry the miracle mask is a good choice for you. I use both products but at different times depending on the current needs of my hair :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps you guys!</li>
            <li> Same as the shampoo that I before I used the conditioner.  Excellent; adds lots of volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything! It&#x27;s for stupid *beep*es who already have silky, no tangled, straight, non-danaged hair to begin with. If your hair is fired, toasted, cripsy when dry, gummy, sticky when wet, and severly damaged to the point that stupid *beep*es at the salon want to give you a chop this product is garbage. Save your money go to Walmart and buy Garnier Moroccan oil, Neutrogena triple moisture deep conditioner mask and Loreal Advanced Recovery Repair mask. These cheaper brand items fixed my hair in no time. For added Keratin go to Sally and get yourself the two step protein treatment that comes with a moisturizing conditioner. These products are cheaper than this useless expensive crap. This is a fancy looking expensive poor quality VO5 crap conditioner. More for shampooing than actually deep conditioning and repairing. It&#x27;s a 10 has high reviews from people who already has perfect hair to begin with, but for the rest of us with severely dead zombies on our heads this won&#x27;t do *beep* to help it out. You are better off getting Mane N Tail conditioner and using that than this *beep*. Again, save your money and search around for cheaper brand products. I gave you a great list of what I used for my bleached out breaking hair that is more normal now. That zombie on my head isn&#x27;t decaying anymore, it&#x27;s more alive, moving effortlessly and is more touchable.</li>
            <li> Have been using tons of conditioners.  This is like the rest you can find at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  Nothing extraordinary.  Probably could use a cheaper kind if you find one.</li>
            <li> The only cons for this one is it only last after 4 washes  . My hair is long and thick so i have to use a lot  . I have a dry color treated hair . This one makes my hair very soft and easy to comb .  But over all its a good deep conditioner .</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have coarse thick hair that frizzes in humidity and this conditioner has helped me manage it. My hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> worked so so for my hair. Made it softer but i didn&#x27;t feel like it strengthen my hair at all. Also did not do any good for my somewhat sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been spending so much money on shampoo you buy from the salon. This stuff works so much better then any shampoo I have every purchased!</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter has blonde hair.  She swims and is constantly in the sun.  It&#x27;s brittle and dry.  I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner to help her hair but this stuff has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> leaves hair with nothing to offer, no changes, no special moisturizing, no overall changes at all. not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I have some dry ends and this really softens them. I love it and well purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had to use a LOT of this product on my hair because it&#x27;s very thick. I thought it would have resulted in smoother silkier hair but I was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s too expensive.  Looking for alternative.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair! Expensive and it&#x27;s not worth it! You can try something else works better like Biolage!</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from over processing and over the course of a few months I tried everything this is the real deal. Nothing is a over night miracle but this is really fantastic</li>
            <li> Love my Its a 10 Miracle Conditioner; it works great on my dry coarse hair,</li>
            <li> I use this after pureology volume shampoo...squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair and then I leave it on the rest of the time that I am in the shower..sometimes up to 10min. I only use it everyother time that I wash my hair though. NOT every time. It leaves my hair smelling amazing and it does not leave it weighted down. I also use the leave in miracle conditioner and then blow dry. I use the leave in conditioner every single day. Amazing products and they all smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair, hope with repeated use, it will get better.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing!!! I have very coarse dry frizzy hair that I overbleached last year and tried so many different shampoos and conditioners, most of them expensive organic brands but none of those things made the slightest difference.  My friend ( who has gorgeous shiny hair) recommended this and I gave it a try.  bought the shampoo, conditioner and the leave-in conditioner and OMG this product has transformed my hair in only a few uses.  My hair is shiny and soft and even if I don&#x27;t straighten it ( which I do do most days), it dries into beautiful relaxed curls and never gets frizzy at all EVEN ON RAINY DAYS - I LOVE these products and totally recommend them to anyone.  They&#x27;ve made a huge difference for my hair and especially if you have damaged hair this would work like magic!  GREAT PRODUCT ( I use the miracle shampoo, miracle deep conditioner plus keratin, and the miracle leave-in conditioner)  :)))</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have very heavily processed hair from color dying every 3 months or so and I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair long, past my mid back, so the ends are so dry and brittle! I know I should go get a trim but I really want to grow my hair and this product keeps my hair so soft and healthy. I used to get this CRAZY tangles behind my neck but with this product I am not getting those tangles anymore! My ends feel good too but I do use the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Conditioner to help moisturize it even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the product is too little to use for my everyday conditioner, hence the 1 star off. I use a lot of the product every wash because my hair is really long. Within two weeks I had to buy another tube which is a little expensive for me to keep up. I think I&#x27;m going to try buying a cheaper everyday keratin conditioner and use the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Hair mask once or twice a week instead. Sadly, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again but definitely a great product and I will buy their other products.</li>
            <li> I tried this deep conditioner as a sample that came with the leave-in conditioner with keratin. Omgosh! I have not had a product that gave the results that this one did to transform my hair in one application. My hair is fine and dry from chemical coloring and gray course hair (under my color). After one application my hair had amazing volume (no other product has done this) and very soft. It looks like I got a new hairdo overnight....one that I love!! Ladies this is the one! I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one works.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I want on my thick head of hair.  I combine it with &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m very pleased with the softness that I feel when I run my hands through my hair.  Now that my hair has really changed since I turned 50 (gray, wiry, and frizzy), I had to find new hair smoothing products.  These two products together do the trick for me.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and shiny..really like it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m glad I was able to return!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair so soft and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner once a week. It works miracles! At first I was skeptical about the price, but it is well worth it. The bottle lasted me a full year and my hair is silky soft every time I use it. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I prefer something that leaves my hair feeling more silky.  I like the Macadamia Nut Oil line, or Redken Smooth Down far better.</li>
            <li> For 20 dollars for such little conditioner you would think it would work. I just had my hair colored blonde and my hair is fried so I bought this. Did absolutely nothing as if I used a 2 dollar conditioner. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Made my hair totally frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the silk collection by It&#x27;s a 10, but this is some really wonderful stuff that made my hair feel soft, silky, and awesome!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly, and frizzy hair. I also color my hair frequently. This product is great to keep your hair healthy and smooth. This product was also a lot more affordable on Amazon then in the salon or regular drug stores. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally a 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a conditioner as good as this. My hair has never felt so silky soft until I used It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner. Also, I noticeably have much less split ends! I read the reviews, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to work this well. I was extremely surprised. I will recommend this product to anyone and guarantee that benefits will be seen after only a few week&#x27;s use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it! you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Because it never hurts to condition your hair and this product is a part of the shampoo in the same brand, I do believe I will continue to use it because I&#x27;m left with soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li> great product...i have used it for about three years...works better than what i used to get at the beauty salon...give it a try and i bet you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time &amp; as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Actually, my wife loves this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly a miracle. After years of damaging my hair and trying countless products, my hair is finally healthy and beautiful. My husband comments on how great it looks all the time, which says A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in LOVE with It&#x27;s a 10 and will continue buying all of their products.</li>
            <li> Seriously......works wonders</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and my recipient is very pleased with it. She uses it regualr and it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> This fixed my over processed and damaged hair within one week of use. I continue to use it once a week now for a deep condition. I only used it on my ends though because I have naturally oily hair and it made it produce more oil...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement to my hair since I started using this product last year. It actually leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The directions are not like regular conditioner: You towel dry your hair first, section it, put the conditioner in, then brush it.</li>
            <li> The round pink 10 in this brand is way better</li>
            <li> Great product, works well on my dry curly hair, especially living in CO.  Just wish it was a little bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is only a 5oz bottle and cost a small fortune. First time I used it a huge bunch of my hair came out. NOT thrilled in the least! I&#x27;ve used it 3(?) times since I&#x27;ve gotten it. I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about. Hair isn&#x27;t any stronger, thicker, healthier, shinier or any number of things they say this does. VERY disappointed in the waste of money. I thought I finally found a product line that would do as it say&#x27;s since it had such good reviews. Am wondering how many of those reviews were bought.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my hair and makes it easy to style</li>
            <li> For the price u think it would be better ! Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft but also leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> Not all it is hyped up to be. Way to expensive for what it is</li>
            <li> I have really long (naturally wavy but I straighten it or put it up most of the time) hair that I have regularly dyed about every 5-6 weeks for several years. The ends of my hair are dry, but not too bad. I usually use Joico moisture recovery treatment balm (it leaves my hair feeling smooth and it&#x27;s easy to brush through), but I had heard good things about this and gave it a try. I would say it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I need on my ends so I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. If your hair is normal then this would probably be a fine product to use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be like the regular conditioner PLUS a good keratin/protein, but instead it seems to be less of each.  Not as good as the Its a 10 moisturizing and not as good as my usual protein conditioner.</li>
            <li> Drug store purchase. Paid same price. Nothing magical or PERFECT about it. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I always order this product from Amazon because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Used it with a heating cap and my hair feels amazing. Soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update after I use it a few times.</li>
            <li> My hair has changed forever because of this product! It went from lifeless straw to looking like doll hair. Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> In LOVE with this product. Have a larger size pump version now because I went through this tube version so fast with long hair. It saves my bleach blonde hair after a salon treatment by stopping snapping, healing split ends, and putting moisture back into my hair in general. Will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this product line. It can be very expensive in the grocery stores. Dont be fooled, even though this is sold in the retail market many hairdressers use it. Give it a try. Leaves hair shiney and smooth.</li>
            <li> After years of chemicals and color my hair literally died in October 2012. I tried so many products in the past months but nothing brought it back to life like the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle line and the Deep Conditioner plus Keratin saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and I&#x27;m already in love. I have hair that often tucks into my pants (so long that the oils from my sccalp rarely reach the ends) and it  is very dry. It immediately helped my poor hair.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample when I ordered their leave in conditioner... and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-spreads really well, a small amount can cover a lot of area when lathered&lt;br /&gt;-seems to absorb into hair really quickly, 2-3 minutes in the shower, and my hair just felt fuller/thicker&lt;br /&gt;-smells amazing, i seriously love the smell of this brand (although I like garnier-fructis a little more)&lt;br /&gt;-if you liked the smell of the leave-in spray, you&#x27;ll love the smell of this&lt;br /&gt;-BEFORE: my hair used to look really dull, kind of brittle, it was frizzy even though I combed out&lt;br /&gt;-AFTER: after the FIRST time using it, my hair was incredibly soft, I kept running my hands through it, it FELT fuller, I don&#x27;t understand how, it&#x27;s like magic unicorn-blood conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;-LESS FRIZZINESS! MORE SHININESS (NOT GREASY SHINY, LUSTER SHINY!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-a little on the expensive side, $15 for 5 oz is pretty steep for conditioner&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper conditioner that probably works equally well available on amazon (the Mane n Tail conditioner is pretty ballin&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: expensive, but if you like the smell and quality, might be worth splurging on yourself to feel great about your hair! (I probably won&#x27;t buy this again until the price goes down, [[ASIN:B000143K2A Mane &#x27;n Tail Deep Moisturizing Conditioner]] and [[ASIN:B004ZWH39A Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner]] are sooo much cheaper, smell good, and work pretty well too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: slightly pricey, if you liked the smell of the leave-in spray, you&#x27;ll love the smell of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004ZWH39A Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner, 13 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair product on the market for thin hair, including expensive salon products like D&#x27;Avines and infomercial products like Wen. Every other product I used made my hair flat or unmanageable.  I tried this after researching products as I was getting desperate for something to make my hair look better.  I am blown away by this product and the shampoo.  My hair feels soft and silky, but not too soft.  My hair is soft, manageable and feels a lot thicker to the touch.  This product is nothing short of a miracle!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love all the its a 10 products! Awesome for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used It&#x27;s a 10 before (I worked at Ulta). My favorite products out of the line are the miracle deep conditioner, the conditioning mask, and the leave in conditioner. All amazing products.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt so smooth and moisturized. It&#x27;s perfect for humid or dry weather. Holy grail hair product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and able to tell my hair is softer.</li>
            <li> I am now a fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle hair care products.  I love the keratin line of products.  My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel, I have extremely dry hair and this works great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes a difference to my hair that were dried after color treatment. Other conditioners can make my hair smoother or more volume but this works beyond that. Wish there is larger size so it can last longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from constant coloring and flat ironing. It&#x27;s a 10 makes it so soft and shiny! I love it.</li>
            <li> Best repair for my hair (and I&#x27;ve tried it all). I use a little dab on my ends every night after my shower and my hair looks and feels so much softer and healthier. MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I can not review this product, I ordered it in February, this is March and I still haven&#x27;t received it.  Once I receive it I will be happy to to rate it.  I believe the 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, 5 oz, would be great once I receive it!!!  Thank you for your time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good, I think, for dry hair. I myself have wavy blonde/brown hair that is healthy, so when I used it, I didn&#x27;t get much results. (I&#x27;ve been using it about once a month, by the way.) My sister, who has wavy, more coarse blonde hair, used it and got good results. It made her hair softer. I&#x27;d recommend soaking it for 15 minutes or longer to get the full effect. The texture is nice and creamy, and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much wrecked my hair with bleach and dye at this point. It&#x27;s not a big deal - I often keep my hair short anyway, so I just chop it off when it gets annoyingly bad and wait a few weeks to grow it out again. I didn&#x27;t feel like going as short as I usually do this time, so I though I&#x27;d look into prolonging the life of my poor, suffering hair with a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this conditioner are well-deserved. I followed the instructions on the bottle (put into clean dry hair, wait 5 minutes, rinse out), and my hair feels so incredibly soft now. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well this worked for me. I keep having to pet myself even though my husband is giving me weird looks. Totally worth it, though.</li>
            <li> I am unable to sense any extra conditioning of my hair after using this product.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product helps tame my curly, frizzy hair and leaves it healthy and silky.  It isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth the price since I use very little.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It was recommended to me by my stylist. You can use as a leave in conditioner or as a mask treatment. I have seen a difference with just two uses.</li>
            <li> I use it with the shampoo in same line. It does not weight the hair down. It has no scent as the shampoo which I like it that way.</li>
            <li> This smelled very good! Can&#x27;t have hair products that don&#x27;t smell good, right? :) The conditioner did some fantastic things for my hair. The dry brittle ends from winter heating season were magically fixed. The course/dry spots on the top of my head were shiny and silky too. This will be my go-to deep conditioner from now on. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> So first, let me just say i am a platinum blonde and have been for 2 years, but recently i was experiencing SEVERE and i mean SEVERE breakage. I have also been doing mine and others hair for 5 years, so i have plenty of experience on breakage on my own and others hair and product usage on more hair than my own. When i had minor breakage the first time, i used the original its a 10 mask and that stuff is AWESOME as well, but the mask PLUS keratin is OFF THE CHARTS for ANY hair type!! Anyone who rates it less than 5 stars is crazy because i have tried everything, including the overly-raved about macadamia oil deep repair mask and that stuff doesn&#x27;t even compare. But caution, if your hair is extremely healthy to begin with, do not use this product often as your hair isnt lacking as much protein as those of us with extreme breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less, this product gets the #1 spot in my long list of hair masks ive gone through and i will never use any hair mask on my hair ever again unless its from Its a 10, just an overall AWESOME brand and i seriously recommend them to anyone with damaged hair, it has returned the strength to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do. My hair is colored and long and it gets really dry. This product helped my hair so much to look good again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever had tangle free hair after shampooing &amp; using this deep conditioner by it&#x27;s a 10. Curls are completely gone but now my hair looks even thinner, finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest Concern is that using Keratin regularly can cause hair breakage &amp; hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the it&#x27;s a 10 Miracle volumizing lite leave in was free of Parabens.</li>
            <li> When Philosophy stopped making Hair Conditioner I was very sad.  Their Amazing Grace conditioner was the best for my hair, especially after swimming.  I searched high and low for a good replacement.  This is my current selection.  I have been using it for about one month now and I like how my hair is nice and conditioned.  The smell is okay, nothing special, but also not awful.  I will update this review if the condition of my hair changes after more use.</li>
            <li> really works well to restore hair after a chemical process</li>
            <li> I bought the 17.5 oz bottle.... I LOVE this conditioner because I bleach my hair blonde so it is extremely dry.  HOWEVER... the 17.5 oz bottle is a complete RIP OFF!! After I used it a few times none would come out of the squirter, so I tried to get the cap off because we all know you can scrape more out of the bottle.... The cap would NOT come off, so my husband cut a big hole in the bottle.  There was ZERO conditioner in the bottle!! I was so confused!... The conditioner is stored in the orange cap!!! WHY make the HUGE bottle if there is only a tiny amount of conditioner stored in the cap!!!! I feel like contacting the manufacturer but there is no 1-800 number or anything on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described. Makes my colored, processed hair super shiny and soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product works great for long blonde curly hair. I&#x27;m able to get a brush through my hair with no difficulty. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite conditioner! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky and tames my normally frizzy curls. My only wish is that it were less expensive!</li>
            <li> Not impressed... After using it several times my hair was heavy but looked and felt like straw.</li>
            <li> Great product as described.  Fast.  Works great.</li>
            <li> i really loved this conditioner and have used the companies other products but wanted to try this keratin one.  A lot of the straightening keratin treatments smell awful but this one is awesome. i love how it makes my hair feel and how it straightens easier. i have thick hair that is wavy and this works great for conditioning. i highly recommend for thick hair it is a great conditioner. i plan on trying the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in using this product. I&#x27;ve been using this 2-3x a week now for about 5 mins in the shower after my normal shampoo and conditioner. I also use the leave in conditioning spray. I can feel a thickness that I was missing and my hair looks like it has more life and body. I will continue to use and may even switch to their shampoo and conditioners! Worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because it keeps my frizzy hair a bit under control, is not my fave, but for the price I think is a good deal..</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The way it feels on my hair and the fragrance is great.  I would definitely order this again.  The company packed and the shipping was great.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years, I was hooked on H2O&#x27;s Milk hair conditioner, and then it suddenly disappeared from every store shelf known to man :/ I went crazy trying to find a product that was just as good and didn&#x27;t cost a billion dollars. My salon rec&#x27;d this conditioner, but I wasn&#x27;t paying $30 for it in store. Luckily, I found it on Amazon for $16! It&#x27;s not as cheap as the Milk product I used, but I think it actually works better. I only use a small amount once a week or if I&#x27;ve spent a long day in the pool. It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth. I have naturally wavy hair, and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used where I can let my hair dry naturally and I don&#x27;t look like the bride of Frankenstein. I&#x27;m happy to say this is my new go to hair treatment. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t fall off the face of the planet like Milk ;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I normally have a hay bale for a head of hair - and got a sample of this recently with another purchase - and tried it out.  And WOW!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve never had silky hair before - but I do now.  And it does not seem to add weight/oiliness/greaseiness...etc.  In the past I&#x27;ve used shampoos and conditioners that add shine - but they all unfortunately add weight and the general look of being unclean.  But this stuff is different...and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  So silky and soft.  :)  Yay.  I wish I&#x27;ve had this stuff since I first sprouted hair.  Just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but can buy locally for same price as Amazon</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.  I have been using this weekly, and it works very well.  I leave it on for a couple of hours with a shower cap and a big towel.  No need for a leave in on the day I condition with this.</li>
            <li> Really works well. Its the best conditioner I ever used period. Excellent smell too. I would more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome item.  I love it.  Now I need more words to fill in this silly review of the item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product. I bought this product 2 month ago based on the good reviews on the web, and used it few times before I finally gave up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I love being a blonde from my now natural light brown, but coloring really dries out my hair and this stuff makes it smooth and shiny and healthy again! This is my favorite deep conditioner found to date - thanks to all the others for great reviews I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> This product used with the shampoo does wonders for moisturizing dry split ends and over processed hair. Makes comb through really easy and leaves hair shiny. My mother in her 80&#x27;s even loves this product, and she has thin hair. I can&#x27;t praise this line of hair care products enough--we&#x27;ll worth the expense.</li>
            <li> The package was broken open and leaking.  I kept it because not a lot was lost but I was disappointed</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and dark blond. It was actually rather healthy before I got this, but I was curious how it would work. I leave it in for about 10 min. The only major difference I can tell is that my hair is softer. But it is a good product, and if your hair is dry, brittle, rough, curly, it should work very well.Tip for curly haired girls: Don&#x27;t even use shampoo. You may not need to. Just rub your scalp with your fingertips in the shower. That should get your hair plenty clean without damaging it. Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> This product made my dry hair look great again. Will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have some allergies to chemicals and this one fits my ok list.  It makes my hair smoother and holds the keratin and the color longer.  The tube has design flaws...When in the shower, water gets into the cap no matter how it is placed (upright or flat). When traveling, product and water ooze out and it must be carried in a ziploc bag. Most annoying is the fact that the blue paint starts to come off as the tube is used.  Little blue flecks are in my hair, my shower stall, and on my hands just from handling the tube to get some product out.  I imagine the designers have never had to travel with this product. I hope they read this.  The product is worth using, especially if they were to redesign the tube.</li>
            <li> makes my hair super soft and it has helped me through my heat damage recovery. I put it on in the shower and put a shower cap on my hair just so that the products could penetrate more and the water won&#x27;t wash it out. when i do wash it out my hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it and it leaves my hair so soft and silky. It has a great smell to it also.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Bought the shampoo with this and it is the best product ever! Worth buying. My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This hair product is aptly named as being a miracle. I have naturally very frizzy hair that has a dried hay texture. I got a straight perm for the first time in my life, and this is one of the products my stylist used to turn my hair into something it had never been before - silky smooth. This is not a leave-in conditioner - I do rinse it out - but it still makes my hair really soft. If I towel dry my hair after using this because I don&#x27;t have time to use a dryer and I&#x27;m running late, my hair is still manageable - which is a new thing for me. My hair is naturally more like a tumbleweed.</li>
            <li> leaves a thick film on my scalp</li>
            <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in product so decided to try thre conditioner. The conditioner actually was too softening and left my hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great deep conditioner since I love the leave-in treatment.. But this left my hair heavy feeling and very dried out. Not a happy customer</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk!!  I put my hair through hell and this made it so soft!  I will be buying this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product. I only leave it in my hair for about 5-7 minutes and it leaves my hair very soft. I can only imagine if you leave it in for more time. Great product.</li>
            <li> If you have dry damaged bleached to the max hair use this and it will feel and look better than when you had normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. To get super soft hair, wash hair in the evening, put this conditioner on (do not rinse), tie and wrap hair in aluminum foil over night, sleep. In the morning, rinse hair and your hair will be super soft with great smell. :) I wish there was a bigger bottle because this runs out quickly. It&#x27;s not enough.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft &amp; shiny.  It is a deep conditioner you leave in for 5 minutes  then rinse.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever for colored hair!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your hair feel less dry and healthier.  Would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty normal just has a dry day once in a while, however, I can not tell the difference between a cheaper product and this product and I&#x27;m not too impressed. I am going to stick to the garnier fructis $4 leave in conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> perfect, but little amount</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pure magic, my chemically damaged hair loves this stuff. I wash my hair twice a week and use this to repair it. I am loyal to this entire line of products. Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair but I can still see and feel a dramatic difference from before i started using it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews of It&#x27;s a 10 products for quite awhile, I finally decided to give them a try and soooooooo glad that I did!!!!  I used the conditioner with the leave in treatment and this is the softest my hair has been in a very, very long time!!!!  I have very dry hair and this has seemed to turn it around!  I am a believer and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It has helped my hair tons. I have waist length hair too:)</li>
            <li> Great product, and service.  One of the best conditioners currently on the market.  If you have a water softener, even better for your hair. Thank you....</li>
            <li> After using this the first time I couldn’t tell any difference, than I used it again for a second time and didn’t notice anything, to me it is not worth the money or the extra min or two in the shower!</li>
            <li> I read about 10 Miracle in a beauty magazine and found the leave-in spray at a local drug store (its was expensive so I decided to try the small 4oz bottle).  Needless to say, the leave-in spray worked so well that I decided to try the conditioner and its amazing.  I have long hair almost to my waist and the Florida humidity make the frizz overwhelming.  All of the 10 Miracle products I&#x27;ve tried work great and Amazon allows you to get the best price.&lt;br /&gt;D-Andy</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair and flat iron it every single day, in addition to getting color, highlights and lowlights. Needless to say, my hair NEEDS all the conditioning it can get. I have tried TONS of products to help with the frizzyness, softness and breakage and so far I have not found anything that works as good as this product and the other It&#x27;s a 10 product I have used. I alternate my shampoo, conditioners and other products each time I wash my hair so I can tell a huge difference with this one. I also let this sit in my hair for a while before rinsing it out. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference, I just know it works so I keep doing it that way.</li>
            <li> I use this during my shower process and have noticed a little difference in my hair! So far so good!</li>
            <li> I actually think this, in the long run, dries your hair out. I&#x27;ve heard before not to use keratin if you have healthy hair and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t listen. My stylist mentioned my dry, tangled hair (and I use other high-quality products). While this definitely makes your hair feel good in the shower I think when it does wash out it pulls your natural vitamins out with it. Would not recommend if you have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my dried, fried and highlighted hair. Also works well diluted with water and sprayed on as a leave in on both curly and straight.</li>
            <li> I had used another It&#x27;s a 10! in the past so thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I use this conditioner for my weekly deeper moisturizing and it&#x27;s great. My hair feels wonderful for days after use. I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Daughter has extemely damaged hair from over processing and was always a matted mess. This made it feel silky and you could get a comb through it. Until it grows out, there is nothing better that we have found.</li>
            <li> It really is awesome! My hair looks like it did when I got a Brazilian blow out BUT I don&#x27;t care for the smell. It stinks! But I still gave it 5 stars because it works that good. Made my hair smooth and it LOOKS healthy ;)</li>
            <li> Looks like I got a Keratin treatment!  The only downside is I used up the tube with 3 uses for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Works great- leaves you hair feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is a great conditioner. I have enjoyed using it over, and over again. I will always enjoy it .</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother...her hair is silver grey...It&#x27;s a 10 makes my mother&#x27;s hair soft and beautiful...really good stuff!  :)</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new, and I love the Keratin in the blow outs.  I tried the product, and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the Biolage deep conditioner that I was using before.</li>
            <li> If you read my other comment, I can&#x27;t help but repeat myself... I LOVE THIS BRAND! I started with the basic shampoo and conditioner, but I do have really processed (used to perm my hair, then colored it, then bleached it, then colored it, then bleached it out again) and this stuff makes my hair feel so amazing. I do use it with the basic shampoo, and then I alternate between the leave in conditioner for blondes and the \\&quot;lite.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I have used aussie, pantene, paul mitchell, dove, tigi (moisture maniac), and probably a half dozen others, and this stuff totally works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have very long chemically treated hair and I see a very noticeable difference when I use the It&#x27;s A 10 Deep Conditioner, It smells great and my hair is soft and shiny all day. You don&#x27;t need to use a ton, so don&#x27;t be alarmed at the small size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This does exactly as it says it does but it is pricey for the little bottle. I will for sure purchase when ever I have a little extra spending cash. My hair hadn&#x27;t hasnt felt so smooth since childhood.</li>
            <li> Just like all of their other products, this conditioner is fantastic.  My hair had become pretty damaged through too much use of blow dryers and my straightening device.  This deep conditioner was recommended to me so I decided to give it a try.  My hair has recovered a lot since I started to use it.  It is softer, less brittle and even has a shine to it.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Too expensive and I don&#x27;t think its doing me any good.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used! Ships fast.</li>
            <li> Anybody with color treated hair, or just damaged hair, should definitely buy this! It smells great and makes your hair so soft! I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help my hair grow since it has keratin in it, but I&#x27;m not sure. I just love the way my hair feels when I&#x27;m putting it on, and brushing it afterwards! So much easier, and I just use it once a week and leave it on for about 5 minutes. Awesome stuff! :)</li>
            <li> The Beat stuff if you have over processed hair like I do. Makes my fine hair soft and calms the frizzies..</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews were so great that I would buy this for my dry hair. I don&#x27;t think it looks or feels as good as I was expecting  especially for  the price. I don&#x27;t think I will benbuying this again,</li>
            <li> My hair is usually completely normal, but it&#x27;s been dry recently. I put the deep conditioner in as leave-in conditioner (just a little everyday) and it makes my hair super silky and soft and healthy. I wouldn&#x27;t normally straighten my hair everyday, but with this in it, my hair is so healthy that I can straighten more often if I wanted to. If used as deep conditioner it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> This is one of several products recommended to me and it works very nicely.  Leaves my hair full of shine and bounce.  Because I have fine hair, I only use this product once a week, then just a little bit.  Does seem to help my color stay deeper and nicer.</li>
            <li> I have really fried dry damaged hair from bleach highlights. This made my hair really soft and it felt healthier. Maybe it&#x27;s only coating it on the outside and not really repairing it but it looks better so that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for more than a year now. I use small amount every time after I shampoo my hair. I&#x27;ve no issues like dandruff or any sort of problems. My hair stopped falling ( not sure due to the conditioner or due to my better eating habits). I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
            <li> The best conditioner.  Pricey but worth it for dry hair.</li>
            <li> very silky conditioner!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what keratin is or what it does but i saw an article online saying i needed it and this product had good reviews so i bought it. i don&#x27;t know what it does, if anything, but i did notice more compliments about my hair and more women wanted to play with it so i consider that a win!</li>
            <li> If you process your hair at all (highlights) or get salon keratin treatments I do not recommend this product.  It left me with an incredible amount of breakage that will take months to grow out.  The shampoo/conditioner combo also seemed to counteract my salon keratin and create a dull/frizzy finish.  I wanted to believe so I kept using it for 2 months (3-4x a week) and will regret it all summer as I grow out my broken hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to what has worked for years:  \\&quot;Keratin Complex\\&quot; shampoo,  \\&quot;Redkin All Soft\\&quot; conditioner, and either \\&quot;Kerastase Nectar Thermique\\&quot; or \\&quot;Kerastase Cimant Thermique\\&quot; pre-blow dry.  I heard Redkin has a new keratin line I might try...but not until I restore my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> Great, love it!  See my review of the shampoo - it also applies here.</li>
            <li> Every product that I have used from &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; has been wonderful. I love their product line! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner, and I have never said that about a shampoo. I have thick, course, kinky/curly hair that has tons of fly aways and tends to look dried out. This conditioner works wonders. Smoothed my hair from top to bottom without weighing it down. I would recommend leaving the conditioner in a little longer than they recommend about 10ish mins to really give it a chance to work. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner so far!!!  Does all 10 things as promised well!  Combing hair in shower will help after shower, we find.  Works on everyone&#x27;s hair BEAUTIFULLY!  Uber worth it!!</li>
            <li> Conditioner is better.  I leave the hair silky and smooth. Oh, really, fool? Really. . .&lt;br /&gt;Stop looking at me, swan.</li>
            <li> Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I have put my hair through hell with the amount of coloring I do and this deep conditioner brought it right back to life</li>
            <li> This TRANSFORMED my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had dull brittle hair, and at the end of this 5 minute treatment&lt;br /&gt;I had soft, lush hair and totally supple ends.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works really well, but it is very expensive</li>
            <li> I find other products that are 1/2 the price to work better for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally bleached and my ends look it. I&#x27;ve tried a few masques, conditioners and coconut oil to try to revive the look and feel of my hair, but nothing seemed to really work or last. I was recommended this by my friend/hairdresser and it works like nothing else! I left it on for 5 minutes and could feel it working instantly. It&#x27;s been 3 days and my hair still feels amazing. This is the BEST deep conditioner for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Service was very good.  Product itself was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> So good! My coworkers were talking about this but I didn&#x27;t buy into the hype, I have really long thick hair and didn&#x27;t think this would work on me. I was pleasantly surprised! Use this and some Willa oil and your hair will be much improved!</li>
            <li> you only need a little. I have long hair that is damaged from dying and medications. This stuff makes my hair look like it did in my youth. The PRICE is to die for!!!! You have my loyalty MyBeautyCenter no one else ever will!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes your hair feel amazing. One of the best products on the market. It&#x27;s a 10 knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  It left my hair smooth and shiny.  I felt like I had a new head of hair.</li>
            <li> I just left the same sort of review on the Shampoo of this set.&lt;br /&gt;I adore the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Product Plus Keratin, so I changed from my usual keratin shampoo and conditioner to try this It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin, and it&#x27;s good...but not the best. I&#x27;ll be switching back to my original favorite, Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner, but I&#x27;m never getting rid of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In, cause that stuff seriously changes your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner was good, but not quite as good as the shampoo of the same set, but it does make hair smoother and a bit shinier, more manageable. I should explain that I&#x27;ve got a white-girl &#x27;fro happening whenever I wash my hair with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; products, and I&#x27;ve learned over time to manage it. This shampoo is definitely a vast improvement to washing my hair with normal formulations, but it&#x27;s not quite as great as it could be. The hair is less weighed down, which can be good, but the ends tend to be a bit fly-away, though not truly static frizzy, with this conditioner. Overall, it&#x27;s very good, but not good enough to de-throne the Suave Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard already, if you have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s best to &amp;#34;co-wash,&amp;#34; as they call it. Put conditioner in your hair FIRST, on dry hair even, if you can manage it, and leave it in for at least a few minutes. I put conditioner on, finish the rest of my shower routine, and as the very last step, I use shampoo on my hair (just the roots/crown area, not the ponytail/ends area), and it makes a huge difference. I think that&#x27;s one reason this set doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, because it really wants the conditioner second like normal, and the results are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t sink in and seal the cuticle with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisture the way &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would still say give this a try.</li>
            <li> I use to have amazing hair. As I&#x27;ve gotten older and used heating products, my hair started to look more and more unhealthy. So I decided to try a deep conditioning treatment, this. My hair feels SO soft and it&#x27;s looking so much better (I have almost no more frizz when my hair air drys!!!!). I&#x27;ve done the treatment 3 times now, once a week. I have a lot of hair, so I think I can probably get 1, maybe 2, more treatments from a bottle. But it&#x27;s so worth the money. I&#x27;m about to buy another bottle. I&#x27;ve been recommending this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this on my greying hair as a deep conditioner after using a violet shampoo. While my hair feels good after the treatment I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything special for the money. Probably will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Seemed pricey, but my sister uses the 10 spray and loves it, so thought Id&#x27; give it a try.  I use the conditioner at least 2x a week and immediately noticed a difference.  My hair is softer, smoother, and less frizzy.  A little bit also goes a long way.  Would recommend and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair after using this product. The product is also a little thin so I had to use a lot of it for all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I leave it in my hair overnight and it leaves my hair feeling soft :)</li>
            <li> Love it, awesome products.</li>
            <li> I really like this. My hair texture is a frizzy wave. When I use this conditioner it helps to smooth it out and make it more manageable. It works great on my hair and I like the scent. The only bad thing is that it is very pricey. You don&#x27;t get a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner combo for color treated hair.  I like to wear my hair straight, so thought the Keratin would be great.  The shampoo does not lather very well.  The conditioner does seem to make my hair soft.  All in all, for the price, I think there are better combo&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the volumizing shampoo. Very nice combination. Have fine hair that gets oily easily. For the first time in years I can avoid washing my hair daily if I want as hair still looks and feels clean, yet isn&#x27;t oily from residue of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love all their products!  I am all the time trying new conditioners since I color and highlight my hair and the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a10&amp;#34; line of products keeps my hair from so much damage because it does a great job detangling the hair.  I&#x27;m a faithful It&#x27;s a 10 customer.</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with the shampoo, leave in conditioner and miracle oil and it works! My hair is healthy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review from before because months later I tried this again since I still had it in my cabinet.  Apparently, the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t really need the keratin treatment part.  Now that I actually do, I find that yes, it does work.  However,  I do still feel like it dulls my hair highlight color job.  (I have my hair highlighted with color not the usual highlighting stuff that can be so damaging to my hair and turn it white since I&#x27;m a natural blonde.)  I use the shampoo, conditioner (this) and the leave in spray.  Maybe I&#x27;m over-doing it especially since this says it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, but again, now that I really need it, I don&#x27;t think the deep conditioning part is over-doing it. (Why do I suddenly need it?  Well, my usual hairdresser was not available last time, and though they swore up and down that the formula for highlighting my hair was the same, uh, I can attest that it was not.  Something damaging occurred as a result this time.  sigh)&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I think this keratin alters my color to a certain extent, but the benefits of how it improves the quality and actual condition of my hair makes me continue to use this about every other hair wash.  (Though maybe all keratin treatment products would alter the hair color??? I just don&#x27;t know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice is to learn about what keratin does to hair and why and when it&#x27;s really needed.  There&#x27;s a big push for it these days.  If you really need it, this product would be worth a try.  However, not everybody really needs a keratin treatment.  Sometimes just a good conditioner and leave-in spray or finishing oil will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:  I used this and the shampoo with a little of the spray before drying.  It left my hair drier than before, and with a change to my recent color job.  Not drastic, but enough to notice since the color was just done a few days ago.  Dulled/ muted the color/highlights.  I like the original products though.  This keratin line is not for me.</li>
            <li> Wow! This was my first time using this after my hair stylist recommended it. It made my hair feel like absolute silk when rinsing it out. It was nice and soft when I dried it and my husband kept saying how good my hair smelled. I like it so far. Would recommend if you have chemical treated/bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd shipment.  I love this stuff it makes my hair so soft and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else.  I checked recently at CVS and it was $10 more there, I will be coming back to Amazon for this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and its fragrance.  It little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was actually not getting the miracle by rinsing it out as apparently everyone else does. It wasn&#x27;t until I dabbed it on while it was almost dry and used it as smoother/styling product that my crazy hair (super processed and with split ends) finally looked shiny and healthy. I will definitely be purchasing again - it helps that it won&#x27;t be a while since you use much less when keeping it on rather than rinsing out.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy for anyone who has given&lt;br /&gt;up on previous conditioners and truly believed their&lt;br /&gt;hair was permanently damaged forever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that it has eliminated my monthly&lt;br /&gt;end trimmings and put a stop to daily snags in my hair.</li>
            <li> Es el mejor acondicionador que he usado, sin dejar el pelo grasoso, deja el pelo con mucho brillo y cuerpo.</li>
            <li> So the first time I used it...I LOVED it.  My hair is extremely thick and dry and my hair feels weightless when I use this deep conditioner.  It also adds softness and moisture.  But, after the 2nd and 3rd uses I became less and less crazy about it.  After the improvement it did the first time, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything further.  It is also beginning to make my hair appear oily, and I&#x27;m having a couple break-outs where my hair touches my skin.  I rarely ever break out.  Overall, I love how weightless it makes my hair feel, but I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the price or worth buying again for now.  I am going to try out some other products.</li>
            <li> After you use this conditioner you will NEVER turn back. It&#x27;s like a deep conditioning from the salon every time you shower. However, because of the Keratin, I only use this once or twice a week and I use a regular conditioner otherwise.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent Vendor. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is a great condioner, however I think this was used and returned, the tube had very little in it, disappointed !</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! Its a 10 is awesome!!! My hair was fried and I was about to cut off 2 inches, but after this stuff I got to keep it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair, and annoying that you are supposed to towel dry your hair before applying.</li>
            <li> If you have fine curly hair - this product will only dry it out more (it has alcohol in it) and weight down the curls (i.e. no bounce, no curl).  Disappointing.  I purchase the product based on a friend’s recommendation and other reviews - it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser sold me this product when I was looking for a deep conditioner similar to what she gave me in the salon.  I use it now every time I wash my hair (about twice a week) because no regular conditioner leaves my hair as soft and manageable.  I leave it on for a few minutes after shampooing and rinse with coolish water.  It&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I left the conditioner longer than it said to on the tube and I loved the results!  Definitely will repurchase this or try the hair masque made by It&#x27;s a 10.  Easy to use and awesome results.</li>
            <li> Definitely try it!  I have thick, coarse, color treated, gray hair.  It makes it manageable.</li>
            <li> After reading great review after great review, I thought I would try this...&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Left hair dry yet greasy looking...&lt;br /&gt;Soooo  disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Using with shampoo and conditioner is the best you can have for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters have tried and got them also.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is so great.  It doesnt make my hair oily like other products do.  It leaves my hair so soft.  I highly recommend all Its A 10 products.  Seriously they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I use this treatment once a week. Have very dry fine , long, colored hair. Good deep conditioner that helps keep my hair manageable .</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hair is soft and manageable.  Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> silky smooth after use :)</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Leaves my hair looking healthy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m crazy about hair products and when I first starting using this and the leave in conditioner I threw everything else out it really helped I have frizzy thick tangly hair severely damaged because I was maintaining red hair it didn&#x27;t completely fix my hair after a week but I did see a huge diffrence and I could actually brush my hair but I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and if I forget to use it one day I hate the feel and look of my hair these people writing bad reviews think it will fix their hair in a day and saying only works for people with perfect hair not true and saying its making your hair fall out???  There is not one ingredient in any of these products that is damaging use it for more than one day your hair won&#x27;t become &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but there is not one product on earth that can make something perfect. Also it smells very good I can smell it on my hair all day and who doesn&#x27;t want beautifully smelling hair?</li>
            <li> I really damaged my hair by over-processing it. I ultimately have had to cut it, but this stuff did help with some of the damage prior to cutting it. I ordered from Salon911 and I actually got it in less than 24 hours, which was amazing - especially considering the fact that my hair was so damaged and I was freaking out. I would use this again to keep my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product, conditions well. I like everything in this product line.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I put this on my hair 1 a week, especially to the ends and i sleep with it in my hair and the next day my hair is as good as new! I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I get instant results. My hair is super silky and shiny. I am Asian so this product works amazingly great. I normally use Bed head dumb blonde reconstructor and shampoo. I switch between that one, Joice K-pak, Redken, Atherna and Matrix. All of them are good but I still like It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner more. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love it..!!!  Hair feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Wow i cant even tell you how great this product is!&lt;br /&gt;My hair Story:&lt;br /&gt; Im a mixed african american female 17, and i have dry semi brittle,curly, color treated hair that has went through 5 years of perms, relaxers,weaves, and dye jobs. Ive been free of all that for a year and a half on a count of my hair falling out after awhile of me putting my hair thru that. Now my hair is alot healthier and has grown alot, but it is still alittle damaged because i straighten my hair almost everyday, dye it 1ce a month or once every 2 months, plus me trying to grow it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Point:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to help make my hair easier to straighten but was weary of actual KEratin treatments because i heard some arnt good for african american hair. So i always liked the its a 10 product line and found out about there keratin plus line and i new i had to try it, so i bought it, dyed my hair to match my extensions then deep conditioned it with the deep conditioner with a bit of shea butter conditioner and WOW after my shower my hair smelled great, and was soft. But the true test was when i was going straighten it how would it turn out? Well let me tell you, my hair straightened sooooo much easier than usual, it smelled amazing, and was soft and shiney! im inlove with this product and will continue to use it 1ce a month because i heard toomuch of a good thing is bad lol. Keratin may be good for you but toomuch of it will damage your hair but still after just 1 use i can tell this product is a life saver!</li>
            <li> I recently went from red colored hair to platinum blond, and needless to say my hair was a little fried. I tried a lot of products, but this stuff turned my straw textured hair into silk. Try doing a longer treatment with heat and be amazed! I am in love!</li>
            <li> Is almost a miracle, really it works since first use. Since I was 14 my hair is freeze, I don&#x27;t know what happened with my brilliant and straight hair, but It was a nightmare, since I&#x27;m using this product, I feel my hair brilliant and smooth.</li>
            <li> Made my hair Instantaneously soft and eliminated tangles!  Kept it on for 3 mins in shower.  I have long hair and this made maintaining soft, shiny hair easier. :)</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well with my hair. I enjoy the product and the conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft.  The price was reasonable and the product came on time.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my quick shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair soft, defines my curls not greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made my hair feel super smooth and not too weighed down. Feels so hydrated with just one use a week.</li>
            <li> Like the feel of my hair but don&#x27;t think it helps to straighten my hair.  I have a pretty good wave in the back of my hair, so maybe that is why.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  it is very pricey however for such a small container.  I have very thick long hair that I straighten so I need to keep it well hydrated.  I use this on my ends and on the top layer of hair on my head and then use regular conditioner after so I am not being wasteful but still hydrating the parts that need extra.  I wish it was at least a few more dollars cheaper.</li>
