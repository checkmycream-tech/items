            <li>I can say about EG oils, is that they are really pretty great!</li>
            <li>Its has a great smell but tends to wafe off very quickly.</li>

            <li>I just need to find scents to add to it to make a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I have friends that have mentioned how my house always smells so nice despite the fact that we have an indoor cat....</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to everyone as it is also good for helping even more things than I have spoke about and</li>
            <li>but, on its own, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>and then i noticed there are so many more just waiting for me to purchase LOL</li>
            <li>it was so nice.  </li>

            <li>Peace, love, and happiness is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li>This brand is not the best quality, but I didnt pay too much for it.</li>

            <li>Love the warmt aroma floating through out my home, just a drop or two on the light bulbs</li>
            <li>Love the smell put it in your defuses, and enjoy the smell...</li>
            <li>Good price shipped fast.</li>
            <li>In Aromatherapy class, I made a blend with a couple of other oils and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE MOST UNIQUE SMELL</li>
            <li>always have loved this scent and this one is a little more woodsy but when you apply it, it smells just right and love Edens Garden company very pleased with their service and product!</li>
            <li>I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily use and not spill.</li>
            <li>dont like that strong smell.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Ah strong scented as nature intended.</li>
            <li>I do not think the scent is too strong either.  </li>
            <li>Too strong and too musty for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather too strong for me and makes me feel dizzy.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I was quite apprehensive to purchase this product at first because I thought the extremely cheap price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Mixed beautifully with Cedarwood and bergamot.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li>very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Edens Garden Essential oil and from this good experience, I will order more from them! :)</li>
            <li>nice scent and seems pure.  </li>
            <li>Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I must say, I will definitely enjoy ordering from you throughout this year and next year and so on... and updating everyone on the great uses for all of them.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product &amp; Eden Gardens for a great variety of fragrances for Therapeutic Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>add one drop of this patchouli to about two-three drops of another company&#x27;s rose absolute oil, then add to fractionated coconut oil for my hair and body.</li>
            <li>, I will add about 1-2 drops of this patchouli, about 6 drops of a sandalwood blend, 4 drops of lavender, and 4 drops of the rose absolute.</li>
            <li>Great essential oil.</li>
            <li>and I hope they continue to be such a great experience.</li>
            <li>Company good to deal with, so far</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Patchouli but not everyone gets it right.</li>
            <li>(if i dont use it all first!!)</li>
            <li>just remember when purchasing this product it is very powerful and it needs to be diluted.</li>
            <li>Very earthy, woody, clean, warm.</li>
            <li>The smell is a musty smooth patchouli, but I prefer a smooth sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Since receiving my purchase, I&#x27;ve used is several times successfully changing my work environment.</li>
            <li>Lets me be more exact and</li>
            <li>I am over the moon excited about it.</li>
            <li>Very authentic smelling, just as it did even in the 70&#x27;s &amp; early 80&#x27;s when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i feel absolutely no need to spend 4-5x more when this one smells so good</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and hassle free as well.</li>
            <li>When using in a lotion, it smells funky at first, but then great the rest of the day and last until I shower again.</li>
            <li>Just like the patchouli scent I love so much.  </li>
            <li>good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is supposed to smell like dirt and true Patchouli lovers know that.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with EOs but as far as I can tell it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>This is a good oil for anyone who uses essential oils.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cloyingly sweet spiced dirtiness.</li>
            <li>Provides a stimulus for a cool, mellow vibe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice when your out with friends and someone will walk by of on the dance floor say to their friends, wow did you catch that</li>
            <li>A gorgeous, true patchouli essential oil.</li>
            <li>But when used in moderation, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is a perfect scent for use in &#x27;aroma therapy,&#x27; as it helps to cover up other less pleasing smells while triggering scent memories of more relaxing and enjoyable times.</li>
            <li>The seller also shipped it in an extremely timely manner, so I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li>I am a Patchouli user since 1969.I have tried many brands since my older brand changed</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good shipping and seller included very helpful and nice pamplets, I Love the fact that this company appears to be Christian based....</li>
            <li>You have a nice inventory with all the different types of back to nature aromas we so very loved as young ladies.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive on time, but it was very nicely wrapped, as well as inlcuded a catalog where I can directly order from the company EDENS GARDEN, whom is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled this on a waitress at our local sports bar and loved it - had to ask her what is was.</li>
            <li>gives me an  easy high inhaling the sweet vapors.</li>
            <li>Far Out!!!!!</li>
            <li>Rocky Mountain essential oils cost more, but are way more pure.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the products available through Eden Gardens</li>
            <li>I place a drop on my light bulbs and the aroma comes forth and gently scents the house...</li>
            <li>I must be an old Hippy, but I love the smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice product.</li>
            <li>and Wow...sit back and enjoy, better than spray..</li>
            <li>I mix my own oils for perfume but there is not a local apothecary.  </li>
            <li>so worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I personally, have some kind of a draw towards patchouli.</li>
            <li>Every oil has their distinct aroma.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m typing this I&#x27;m playing old Cream songs in my head.  :-)  </li>
            <li>The product guide lists all their oils by botanical name, as well as how and when they are useful.</li>
            <li>actually put 1 drop under my armpits to test the oil out just because I heard patchouli essential oil was good as a deoderant, and before that all day today I have had anxiety and about 15 minutes after I put the oil on, I had noticed I was alot calmer and relaxed!</li>
            <li>After many years of enjoying the fragrance of Patchouli Essential Oil, I was having difficulty locating a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Superior quality at a fraction of the price of other companies.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff nightly and it puts me right to sleep.</li>
            <li>priced right</li>
            <li>This bottle I got arrived right away</li>
            <li>So now that the use of EO&#x27;s for aromatherapy and alternative healing has really exploded in popularity, I decided to reinvest my interests in this very interesting approach to health &amp; wellbeing.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare Eden&#x27;s Garden to any of the YL or DT oils, for personally</li>
            <li>Bottle is full to the brim and despite using it almost every day, still have most of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied it was all they expected it to</li>
            <li>PURE FORM AND CHEAPEST ON THE MARKET!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, packaged very well.</li>
            <li>This went to one member of my family and so far only good reviews.</li>
            <li>how successfully they were a covering up other smells, so I began a search for this one particular scent - patchouli.</li>
            <li>you do not need to use very much .</li>
            <li>very fast delivery also and</li>
            <li>OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this one, so I use it wherever and whenever I can, it gives the other oils I use a more distinct and sweet smell</li>
            <li>Will purchase more essential oils from Edens Gardens.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering all of my essential oils from this company from now on!  :)</li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for fall!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the manufacturer but more to do with personal preference and my mood.</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my crafting projects at an affordable price</li>
            <li>I love adding Lavender or Lemon Essential Oil with my Patchouli Oil.</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy fragrance!</li>
            <li>Thanks!  - R</li>
            <li>First of all, my mom put some of the patchouli oil into a spray bottle and added water to it.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than the patchouli I bought in my local health food store.</li>
            <li>The scent was okay mixed with orange and geranium</li>
            <li>The first time I made this concoction, I had added 2-3 drops of the patchouli.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First I want to comment on Edens Garden shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li>My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender.</li>
            <li>Once you open that top</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure this will cure some people&#x27; dizziness since everyone&#x27;s different !~ ^^</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t much care for this, not the sellers fault at all!</li>
            <li>(Sunshine of your Love, White Room).</li>
            <li>I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>At first I was hoping that once it &#x27;breathes&#x27;, it might smell like it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>i cant wait to see how good it smells in a few months</li>
            <li>After a quick review of the many Eden Gardens products I made my purchase of a single bottle of 100% pure therapeutic patchouli oil.</li>
            <li>I recommend mountainroseherbs.com, very clean and inexpensive organic essential oils.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the oil is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>I have bought several of their oils and I am never disappointed!</li>
            <li>The music spiked on old memory of some of the places I would stores we used to frequent to buy music and the exotic smells used by the shop owners to enhance their shopping environments.</li>
            <li>Just a good basic essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I use it as a bar soap, mix it with other essential fragrances, and get some of the most exotic smells avaiable.  </li>
            <li>The tube is inside of the bottle, with a cap ontop that allows you to control  drops just as effectively as using an eye dropper, and less chance of knocking over and spilling the contents.  </li>
            <li>This is as pure as it gets .</li>
            <li>It smelled like pure Patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li>but this is PURE oil</li>
            <li>I was looking for a 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>I have used it both on my body and on my lamp rings and find the scent to be pure without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This really is pure.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pure grade.</li>
            <li>the oils have helped with the problems that I was having, I have bought more from this sell and would buy more as long as I needed to for other problems.</li>
            <li>i use this oil in my crock pot type oil burner, add a little warm water and simmer...</li>
            <li>When I smell the oil in the bottle, it&#x27;s a little strong, but when I put it in my hair, it has a clean, earthy aroma.</li>
            <li>This Patchouli is very potent so a very little is all that is needed.</li>
            <li>It controls my frizz every time, and when I massage with it, I feel really relaxed.</li>
            <li>I received this item today 01/20/22015 item description as described thanks for prompt service .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>A lot of essential oils smell cheap, but you can smell the quality in this oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very musky scent and layers well with others.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast</li>
            <li>Thanks for a grat product</li>
            <li>Not for high school!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>but she was not getting much relief.</li>
            <li>She said that she could not believe it, when she sprayed that on her knee, it started relieving her pain, she absolutely swears by it.</li>
            <li>Shipping fast and oil arrived intact.  </li>
            <li>Opened top to bottle and there was still not much patchouli smell.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable for size.</li>
            <li>absolutely enchanting.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t take much to do what you might what to do with it..</li>
            <li>The one I got smelled really bad...not even like dirt.</li>
            <li>I also used a few drops into a bath and that was nice too.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other oil I received, this scent is much better.</li>
            <li>I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t get much and since they do not have Amazon Prime, the price of the oil and then shipping is rather high for the amount of oil you get.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong and long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>When this therapeutic grade 100% pure essential oil arrived, I knew that I had made the right</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses.</li>
            <li>I ordered several from them in one order, and was pleased with the entire order.</li>
            <li>This particular oil, is just as patchouli is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>really appreciated the fast shipping as well as the professional packaging.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Quality appears high.</li>
            <li>Is all as described and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)...</li>
            <li>This oil is long lasting, strong at first but gets lighter in smel.</li>
            <li>It was packaged with a super cool product guide on all the essential oils the company offers, as well as a book on 101 ways to use essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for several oils and it never fails to impress!</li>
            <li>A little too earthy and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>Had to contact seller and seller replied fast and professional.</li>
            <li>Makes me smile big</li>
            <li>This just brought me right back to high school.</li>
            <li>which makes the vacuum bag smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Many of the essential oils did not have the earthy woodsy subtle fragrance I had come to enjoy &amp; expect.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells like patchouli, but the scent is VERY concentrated, so I would definitely not suggest wearing more than a tiny drop of it at a time.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I have been a wearer of this essential oil fragrance for 25 years&#x27;now and it is getting tough to find a good pure fragrance.</li>
            <li>Natural, subtle, lovely!</li>
            <li>Goes on strong but is actually more subtle than I expected.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of patchouli (b/c there are different types) was very strong and heavy smelling.  </li>
            <li>You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing.</li>
            <li>I used it so quickly that I purchased the larger size next time.</li>
            <li>tell its pure, will be adding this to lotions and such!</li>
            <li>Very strong, but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use.</li>
            <li>soft scent.</li>
            <li>As I have said before I really can&#x27;t say enough about Edens Garden Oils.</li>
            <li>I never used Patchouli Oil before I bought this, but now I use it a lot on my natural, curly hair for massaging and sealing the ends.</li>
            <li>A Soft unuffending  aroma permeates and radiates all day</li>
            <li>I wear this as a signature scent and have been wearing patchouli since the early 70&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li>Also you can renew natural smell of your body.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO</li>
            <li>Almost smelled like old wood in a musty basement.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested this brand but thus far just smelling</li>
            <li>Wow, just purchased this</li>
            <li>I recommend buying Edens Garden directly through their website, though because you can see it all in one place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely patchouli - very stout and distinctive scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like dirt or old leaves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to buy in person so you can at least smell them.  </li>
            <li>WOW-</li>
            <li>Patchouli oil is far out.</li>
            <li>Right now the aroma of this particular brand of patchouli is a little too sharp instead of warm, and there is no sweet lingering scent.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops, which seem to last all day and cover a very large area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how different patchouli&#x27;s can smell so different, but I like them all.</li>
            <li>its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth smelling as other Patchouli oils I have used, seems to have a sharp odor.</li>
            <li>A very concentrated oil,will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I turned my attention to the internet and finally found Eden Gardens through the Amazon marketplace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and none have ever measured up to the old Spiritual Sky patchouli...</li>
            <li>Sorry, but to be honest that smell yucky.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for its benefits, not so much for the scent, but it is hard to wear compared to other brands of Patchouli EO.</li>
            <li>I will stay with Auro Casia from now on, or any other brand that smells like pure Patchouli.  </li>
            <li>I could find it at any of the local stores, instead I&#x27;ve find smells like mountain fresh, lavender, citrus, and other various flowering scents,, but no patchouli.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is a nice smelling wood base note that isnt too light or heavy, it is slightly sweet and makes a good masculine base.</li>
            <li>Next, she has a really bad knee that causes her a great deal of pain, (she and I both suffer from fibromyalgia)</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product</li>
            <li>It smells good after a half hour or so, but when you first put it on the scent is dusty and hard to bare.</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what I remember from my teens during the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I lost my first one, and a few months later purchased a second one.</li>
            <li>I smelled a little too much like a hippie that day, let me tell</li>
            <li>Dropper runs a little to fast though.  </li>

            <li> I can say about EG oils, is that they are really pretty great!</li>
            <li> Its has a great smell but tends to wafe off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Then it smells amazing after that part wears off.</li>

            <li> And now I have some of my own from Eden&#x27;s Garden.</li>
            <li> nice quality, would buy it again</li>
            <li> I just need to find scents to add to it to make a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have friends that have mentioned how my house always smells so nice despite the fact that we have an indoor cat....</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to everyone as it is also good for helping even more things than I have spoke about and</li>
            <li> but, on its own, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and then i noticed there are so many more just waiting for me to purchase LOL</li>
            <li> it was so nice.  </li>

            <li> Peace, love, and happiness is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> This brand is not the best quality, but I didnt pay too much for it.</li>

            <li> always have loved this scent and this one is a little more woodsy but when you apply it, it smells just right and love Edens Garden company very pleased with their service and product!</li>
            <li> I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> so you can easily use and not spill.</li>
            <li> dont like that strong smell.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Ah strong scented as nature intended.</li>
            <li> I do not think the scent is too strong either.  </li>
            <li> Too strong and too musty for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather too strong for me and makes me feel dizzy.</li>
            <li> We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I was quite apprehensive to purchase this product at first because I thought the extremely cheap price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Mixed beautifully with Cedarwood and bergamot.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li> very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li> This is my first Edens Garden Essential oil and from this good experience, I will order more from them! :)</li>
            <li> nice scent and seems pure.  </li>
            <li> Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I must say, I will definitely enjoy ordering from you throughout this year and next year and so on... and updating everyone on the great uses for all of them.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product &amp; Eden Gardens for a great variety of fragrances for Therapeutic Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li> add one drop of this patchouli to about two-three drops of another company&#x27;s rose absolute oil, then add to fractionated coconut oil for my hair and body.</li>
            <li> , I will add about 1-2 drops of this patchouli, about 6 drops of a sandalwood blend, 4 drops of lavender, and 4 drops of the rose absolute.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil.</li>
            <li> and I hope they continue to be such a great experience.</li>
            <li> Company good to deal with, so far</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Patchouli but not everyone gets it right.</li>
            <li> (if i dont use it all first!!)</li>
            <li> just remember when purchasing this product it is very powerful and it needs to be diluted.</li>
            <li> Very earthy, woody, clean, warm.</li>
            <li> The smell is a musty smooth patchouli, but I prefer a smooth sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Since receiving my purchase, I&#x27;ve used is several times successfully changing my work environment.</li>
            <li> Lets me be more exact and</li>
            <li> I am over the moon excited about it.</li>
            <li> Very authentic smelling, just as it did even in the 70&#x27;s &amp; early 80&#x27;s when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i feel absolutely no need to spend 4-5x more when this one smells so good</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and hassle free as well.</li>
            <li> When using in a lotion, it smells funky at first, but then great the rest of the day and last until I shower again.</li>
            <li> Just like the patchouli scent I love so much.  </li>
            <li> good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is supposed to smell like dirt and true Patchouli lovers know that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with EOs but as far as I can tell it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> This is a good oil for anyone who uses essential oils.</li>
            <li> It smells like a cloyingly sweet spiced dirtiness.</li>
            <li> Provides a stimulus for a cool, mellow vibe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice when your out with friends and someone will walk by of on the dance floor say to their friends, wow did you catch that</li>
            <li> A gorgeous, true patchouli essential oil.</li>
            <li> But when used in moderation, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is a perfect scent for use in &#x27;aroma therapy,&#x27; as it helps to cover up other less pleasing smells while triggering scent memories of more relaxing and enjoyable times.</li>
            <li> The seller also shipped it in an extremely timely manner, so I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> I am a Patchouli user since 1969.I have tried many brands since my older brand changed</li>
            <li> That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good shipping and seller included very helpful and nice pamplets, I Love the fact that this company appears to be Christian based....</li>
            <li> You have a nice inventory with all the different types of back to nature aromas we so very loved as young ladies.</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrive on time, but it was very nicely wrapped, as well as inlcuded a catalog where I can directly order from the company EDENS GARDEN, whom is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> I first smelled this on a waitress at our local sports bar and loved it - had to ask her what is was.</li>
            <li> gives me an  easy high inhaling the sweet vapors.</li>
            <li> Far Out!!!!!</li>
            <li> Rocky Mountain essential oils cost more, but are way more pure.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the products available through Eden Gardens</li>
            <li> I place a drop on my light bulbs and the aroma comes forth and gently scents the house...</li>
            <li> I must be an old Hippy, but I love the smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice product.</li>
            <li> and Wow...sit back and enjoy, better than spray..</li>
            <li> I mix my own oils for perfume but there is not a local apothecary.  </li>
            <li> so worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I personally, have some kind of a draw towards patchouli.</li>
            <li> Every oil has their distinct aroma.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m typing this I&#x27;m playing old Cream songs in my head.  :-)  </li>
            <li> The product guide lists all their oils by botanical name, as well as how and when they are useful.</li>
            <li> actually put 1 drop under my armpits to test the oil out just because I heard patchouli essential oil was good as a deoderant, and before that all day today I have had anxiety and about 15 minutes after I put the oil on, I had noticed I was alot calmer and relaxed!</li>
            <li> After many years of enjoying the fragrance of Patchouli Essential Oil, I was having difficulty locating a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Superior quality at a fraction of the price of other companies.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff nightly and it puts me right to sleep.</li>
            <li> priced right</li>
            <li> This bottle I got arrived right away</li>
            <li> So now that the use of EO&#x27;s for aromatherapy and alternative healing has really exploded in popularity, I decided to reinvest my interests in this very interesting approach to health &amp; wellbeing.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare Eden&#x27;s Garden to any of the YL or DT oils, for personally</li>
            <li> Bottle is full to the brim and despite using it almost every day, still have most of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied it was all they expected it to</li>
            <li> PURE FORM AND CHEAPEST ON THE MARKET!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This went to one member of my family and so far only good reviews.</li>
            <li> how successfully they were a covering up other smells, so I began a search for this one particular scent - patchouli.</li>
            <li> you do not need to use very much .</li>
            <li> very fast delivery also and</li>
            <li> OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this one, so I use it wherever and whenever I can, it gives the other oils I use a more distinct and sweet smell</li>
            <li> Will purchase more essential oils from Edens Gardens.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering all of my essential oils from this company from now on!  :)</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for fall!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the manufacturer but more to do with personal preference and my mood.</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my crafting projects at an affordable price</li>
            <li> I love adding Lavender or Lemon Essential Oil with my Patchouli Oil.</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy fragrance!</li>
            <li> Thanks!  - R</li>
            <li> First of all, my mom put some of the patchouli oil into a spray bottle and added water to it.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than the patchouli I bought in my local health food store.</li>
            <li> The scent was okay mixed with orange and geranium</li>
            <li> The first time I made this concoction, I had added 2-3 drops of the patchouli.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First I want to comment on Edens Garden shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender.</li>
            <li> Once you open that top</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure this will cure some people&#x27; dizziness since everyone&#x27;s different !~ ^^</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t much care for this, not the sellers fault at all!</li>
            <li> (Sunshine of your Love, White Room).</li>
            <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> At first I was hoping that once it &#x27;breathes&#x27;, it might smell like it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> i cant wait to see how good it smells in a few months</li>
            <li> After a quick review of the many Eden Gardens products I made my purchase of a single bottle of 100% pure therapeutic patchouli oil.</li>
            <li> I recommend mountainroseherbs.com, very clean and inexpensive organic essential oils.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the oil is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of their oils and I am never disappointed!</li>
            <li> The music spiked on old memory of some of the places I would stores we used to frequent to buy music and the exotic smells used by the shop owners to enhance their shopping environments.</li>
            <li> Just a good basic essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I use it as a bar soap, mix it with other essential fragrances, and get some of the most exotic smells avaiable.  </li>
            <li> The tube is inside of the bottle, with a cap ontop that allows you to control  drops just as effectively as using an eye dropper, and less chance of knocking over and spilling the contents.  </li>
            <li> This is as pure as it gets .</li>
            <li> It smelled like pure Patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li> but this is PURE oil</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it both on my body and on my lamp rings and find the scent to be pure without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This really is pure.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pure grade.</li>
            <li> the oils have helped with the problems that I was having, I have bought more from this sell and would buy more as long as I needed to for other problems.</li>
            <li> i use this oil in my crock pot type oil burner, add a little warm water and simmer...</li>
            <li> When I smell the oil in the bottle, it&#x27;s a little strong, but when I put it in my hair, it has a clean, earthy aroma.</li>
            <li> This Patchouli is very potent so a very little is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> It controls my frizz every time, and when I massage with it, I feel really relaxed.</li>
            <li> I received this item today 01/20/22015 item description as described thanks for prompt service .</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> A lot of essential oils smell cheap, but you can smell the quality in this oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very musky scent and layers well with others.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Thanks for a grat product</li>
            <li> Not for high school!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> but she was not getting much relief.</li>
            <li> She said that she could not believe it, when she sprayed that on her knee, it started relieving her pain, she absolutely swears by it.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast and oil arrived intact.  </li>
            <li> Opened top to bottle and there was still not much patchouli smell.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable for size.</li>
            <li> absolutely enchanting.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take much to do what you might what to do with it..</li>
            <li> The one I got smelled really bad...not even like dirt.</li>
            <li> I also used a few drops into a bath and that was nice too.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other oil I received, this scent is much better.</li>
            <li> I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t get much and since they do not have Amazon Prime, the price of the oil and then shipping is rather high for the amount of oil you get.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong and long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> When this therapeutic grade 100% pure essential oil arrived, I knew that I had made the right</li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered several from them in one order, and was pleased with the entire order.</li>
            <li> This particular oil, is just as patchouli is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> really appreciated the fast shipping as well as the professional packaging.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Quality appears high.</li>
            <li> Is all as described and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)...</li>
            <li> This oil is long lasting, strong at first but gets lighter in smel.</li>
            <li> It was packaged with a super cool product guide on all the essential oils the company offers, as well as a book on 101 ways to use essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for several oils and it never fails to impress!</li>
            <li> A little too earthy and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> Had to contact seller and seller replied fast and professional.</li>
            <li> Makes me smile big</li>
            <li> This just brought me right back to high school.</li>
            <li> which makes the vacuum bag smell fresh.</li>
            <li> Many of the essential oils did not have the earthy woodsy subtle fragrance I had come to enjoy &amp; expect.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells like patchouli, but the scent is VERY concentrated, so I would definitely not suggest wearing more than a tiny drop of it at a time.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have been a wearer of this essential oil fragrance for 25 years&#x27;now and it is getting tough to find a good pure fragrance.</li>
            <li> Natural, subtle, lovely!</li>
            <li> Goes on strong but is actually more subtle than I expected.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of patchouli (b/c there are different types) was very strong and heavy smelling.  </li>
            <li> You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing.</li>
            <li> I used it so quickly that I purchased the larger size next time.</li>
            <li> tell its pure, will be adding this to lotions and such!</li>
            <li> Very strong, but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use.</li>
            <li> soft scent.</li>
            <li> As I have said before I really can&#x27;t say enough about Edens Garden Oils.</li>
            <li> I never used Patchouli Oil before I bought this, but now I use it a lot on my natural, curly hair for massaging and sealing the ends.</li>
            <li> A Soft unuffending  aroma permeates and radiates all day</li>
            <li> I wear this as a signature scent and have been wearing patchouli since the early 70&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li> Also you can renew natural smell of your body.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO</li>
            <li> Almost smelled like old wood in a musty basement.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested this brand but thus far just smelling</li>
            <li> Wow, just purchased this</li>
            <li> I recommend buying Edens Garden directly through their website, though because you can see it all in one place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely patchouli - very stout and distinctive scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like dirt or old leaves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to buy in person so you can at least smell them.  </li>
            <li> WOW-</li>
            <li> Patchouli oil is far out.</li>
            <li> Right now the aroma of this particular brand of patchouli is a little too sharp instead of warm, and there is no sweet lingering scent.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops, which seem to last all day and cover a very large area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how different patchouli&#x27;s can smell so different, but I like them all.</li>
            <li> its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth smelling as other Patchouli oils I have used, seems to have a sharp odor.</li>
            <li> A very concentrated oil,will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I turned my attention to the internet and finally found Eden Gardens through the Amazon marketplace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and none have ever measured up to the old Spiritual Sky patchouli...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but to be honest that smell yucky.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for its benefits, not so much for the scent, but it is hard to wear compared to other brands of Patchouli EO.</li>
            <li> I will stay with Auro Casia from now on, or any other brand that smells like pure Patchouli.  </li>
            <li> I could find it at any of the local stores, instead I&#x27;ve find smells like mountain fresh, lavender, citrus, and other various flowering scents,, but no patchouli.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is a nice smelling wood base note that isnt too light or heavy, it is slightly sweet and makes a good masculine base.</li>
            <li> Next, she has a really bad knee that causes her a great deal of pain, (she and I both suffer from fibromyalgia)</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product</li>
            <li> It smells good after a half hour or so, but when you first put it on the scent is dusty and hard to bare.</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what I remember from my teens during the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I lost my first one, and a few months later purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> I smelled a little too much like a hippie that day, let me tell</li>
            <li> Dropper runs a little to fast though.  </li>
            <li> I also add it to a cotton ball and vacuum it up</li>
            <li> Packaged well and came with a small booklet about different uses of Essential Oils - very helpful</li>
            <li> So the other month I was reviewing some old music, on Amazon&#x27;s MP3 website.</li>
            <li> I can smell Patchouli in this oil but it isn&#x27;t like the pure Patchouli oil I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> anyone can enhance their personal, private and even public work environments easing stress and enhancing their mental and physical well being.</li>
            <li> Brothers say scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Only need a drop to smell Patchouliful all day long</li>
            <li> my oil will last me a long time as well as the prosperity is draws.</li>
            <li> Long lasting too!</li>
            <li> Poor quality, scent dissipates quickly..</li>
            <li> Smells like real, true patchouli, not the crap some folks wore when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> you judge for yourself it last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> It lasts long though, unlike a lot of oils and perfumes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;d change is that both purchases I&#x27;ve made from them, they&#x27;ve sent me the same pamphlet and product catalog and it seems like such a waste of paper.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching oils before deciding which to purchase, and read a lot of reviews and opinions through different medium.  </li>
            <li> Give EO&#x27;s a try if you have been battling acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> for the Essential oil itself, I don&#x27;t have any previous experience with patchouli essential oils</li>
            <li> The only reason for the 3 star is due to price.</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> Keeps the smell down when im riding in the back seat of a cruiser.</li>
            <li> long story short; i was missing patchouli and decided to reorder THIS from diff seller.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> It lasts on my skin all day and people remark about it even late in the day after I have worn it since early morning</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase my east jail oils from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...</li>
            <li> so you need very little of it to apply, so it will last a long time !!</li>
            <li> There was an undertone of something strong and unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> I added to a burner without any other oil</li>
            <li> I use on my body as do my other 5 sisters and 2 brothers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other curlies.</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t wear other purfumes.</li>
            <li> For this price and quality, I have to say that I won&#x27;t be needing to order oils from any other sellers.</li>
            <li> I believe the formula changes for these essential oils, and the scent is inconsistent, and sometime has an excessive solvents odor, though I was hoping these had been extracted without solvents or ethanol.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other scent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other scents from Edens Garden</li>
            <li> compared to other brands</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I think I can definitely overlook it!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that i didn&#x27;t get my original order of Patchouli, and now i cant stop putting it in EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong, and VERY unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s seductive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those scents that either you love it or you hate it-</li>
            <li> I am hoping that it calms down and softens</li>
            <li> And this is after trying all other forms of flea control!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but that&#x27;s usually the case with Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put this away for a while and see if the scent changes to something less dirt-like with time.</li>
            <li> little goes along way</li>
            <li> I was a little spectacle being that</li>
            <li> the worst complaints that I read were &amp;#34;Eden&#x27;s Garden doesn&#x27;t grow their own plants</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to lotion</li>
            <li> It just smells old and stale.</li>
            <li> but I just use a drop less then usual.</li>
            <li> Not a sweet patchouli smell like I am use to!</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of the patchouli oil on her collar and within a few days, the fleas were gone!</li>
            <li> this reminds me of a blast from the past.</li>
            <li> so I freeze it in small chunks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Patchouli that I have had in the past</li>
            <li> and I usually mix with alcohol in a travel spray bottle and saves me tons on cologne.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like any patchouli oil I ever bought for my wife over the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to describe it as.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about an included statement, that their oils are &amp;</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a day when I&#x27;m nauseated (due to a long-term illness)</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to get past because it&#x27;s over powering</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard getting it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how the oils offered here on Amazon are going to smell though.  </li>
            <li> Then, she has had a really bad sore on one of her toes that nothing was helping, she started spraying this patchouli oil and water mixture on it, and now that sore is almost completely gone and it no longer hurts.</li>
            <li> For some reason I keep wearing it hoping for a different outcome, but it definitely really stinks.</li>
            <li> Someone complained that the products &amp;#34;don&#x27;t come with a dropper&amp;#34; - there is a dropper, it just isn&#x27;t the one Americans are accustomed to.  </li>
            <li> Not very scented and smells kinda weird.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s musky,</li>
            <li> However the drops come out too slowly.</li>
            <li> I found some expensive perfume the other day and when I got it home</li>
            <li> I dab a very small amount on my neck and wrist-sticks with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not a good idea to do that.  </li>
            <li> this smells pretty horrible, and I like patchouli.</li>
            <li> Friend thought it was weak.</li>
            <li> It has to be mixed with a base oil for burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of fake scents like candles and air fresheners, so I was a little afraid of this scent</li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> I use it instead of expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane what some of those oils are priced at, for what they are actually worth.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> suffocating scent and no migraine for me!</li>
            <li> very nostalgic.</li>
            <li> For instance, I went to an outdoor concert one night and without thinking about the fact that I would be on my feet all night (about 6-7 hours), I wore cowboy boots, by the time I came home, my feet and legs hurt so bad</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the bottle I was actually disappointed by the weakness of the scent</li>
            <li> added to my Vitamin E skin oil, my spritz bottle for air freshener, in an oil base for room fresheners.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; is the worst design I have ever seen ....</li>
            <li> this has a terrible smell, it is not patchouli.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice, speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scents, great price.</li>
            <li> I must be an old Hippy, but I love the smell of patchouli. It&#x27;s funny how different patchouli&#x27;s can smell so different, but I like them all. This is a nice strong smell, not wimpy. It will be good in a lotion or carrier oil, I like it.</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  Just like the patchouli scent I love so much.  I added to a burner without any other oil but it is not a good idea to do that.  It has to be mixed with a base oil for burning.</li>
            <li> nice. soft scent. I use on my body as do my other 5 sisters and 2 brothers. Brothers say scent doesn&#x27;t last long. All of us girls like it, but it still isn&#x27;t quite what we like. I will buy again as will my sisters. You have a nice inventory with all the different types of back to nature aromas we so very loved as young ladies.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this to make incense sticks and I love the smell of it.  They did a great job sending it wrapped up and getting it to me fast.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden oils, as a rule, are excellent.  I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  This company deserves your business if you are into Aromatherapy, fragrance blending, soap making etc.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied it was all they expected it to</li>
            <li> As I have said before I really can&#x27;t say enough about Edens Garden Oils. The more you use the more you like them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t not get enough of Edens Garden oils. I use this stuff nightly and it puts me right to sleep. The only reason for the 3 star is due to price. You really don&#x27;t get much and since they do not have Amazon Prime, the price of the oil and then shipping is rather high for the amount of oil you get. Other than that, the oil is truly amazing. We use the Patchouli and another one called Love and both are just amazing and placing a calm in the room.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, packaged very well. This has a wonderful aroma - just as I remember from my childhood. Love it. Will purchase more essential oils from Edens Gardens.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil for a good price.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth smelling as other Patchouli oils I have used, seems to have a sharp odor. It&#x27;s also hard getting it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> dont like that strong smell. is not the pachulli I have purches before . not with you with a nother company.</li>
            <li> I never used Patchouli Oil before I bought this, but now I use it a lot on my natural, curly hair for massaging and sealing the ends. It&#x27;s really nice. When I smell the oil in the bottle, it&#x27;s a little strong, but when I put it in my hair, it has a clean, earthy aroma. I would recommend this product to other curlies. It controls my frizz every time, and when I massage with it, I feel really relaxed. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I received this item today 01/20/22015 item description as described thanks for prompt service .</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin care! Edens Garden is great!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped. It is ok though.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  Packaged well and came with a small booklet about different uses of Essential Oils - very helpful and some uses I never would have thought of.  OMG - I love the smell, now I don&#x27;t want to use it but just sit and smell it.  Definitely an A+.</li>
            <li> This oil smells more like dirt than patchouli. For some reason I keep wearing it hoping for a different outcome, but it definitely really stinks.</li>
            <li> Earthy, warm, lovely...good oil...nice to put in a respirator blower for oils, or massage or 101 uses. Buy it. You will like it</li>
            <li> Great delivery time,  excellent product... Price was fair</li>
            <li> Smells great, love oils on my wifes wrist. She won&#x27;t wear other purfumes. Good price shipped fast. thank you.</li>
            <li> I work at an airport and there are times when the smells are overwhelming, from jet fuels to foods and yes even passengers who have been traveling for hours on end. So the other month I was reviewing some old music, on Amazon&#x27;s MP3 website. The music spiked on old memory of some of the places I would stores we used to frequent to buy music and the exotic smells used by the shop owners to enhance their shopping environments. I could remember the smells and how successfully they were a covering up other smells, so I began a search for this one particular scent - patchouli. I could find it at any of the local stores, instead I&#x27;ve find smells like mountain fresh, lavender, citrus, and other various flowering scents,, but no patchouli. Naturally, I turned my attention to the internet and finally found Eden Gardens through the Amazon marketplace. After a quick review of the many Eden Gardens products I made my purchase of a single bottle of 100% pure therapeutic patchouli oil. Since receiving my purchase, I&#x27;ve used is several times successfully changing my work environment. It only takes a couple of drops, which seem to last all day and cover a very large area. Patchouli is a perfect scent for use in &#x27;aroma therapy,&#x27; as it helps to cover up other less pleasing smells while triggering scent memories of more relaxing and enjoyable times. Thanks to the products available through Eden Gardens anyone can enhance their personal, private and even public work environments easing stress and enhancing their mental and physical well being.</li>
            <li> I have found my source for Therapeutic Essential Oils from Eden Gardens and Amazon. After many years of enjoying the fragrance of Patchouli Essential Oil, I was having difficulty locating a high quality product. Many of the essential oils did not have the earthy woodsy subtle fragrance I had come to enjoy &amp; expect. With a very quick response &amp; delivery, I now have this resource I will utilize again for sure. I use this oil for my daily fragrance (one drop on wrists), added to my Vitamin E skin oil, my spritz bottle for air freshener, in an oil base for room fresheners. I recommend this product &amp; Eden Gardens for a great variety of fragrances for Therapeutic Essential Oils. ~One Happy &amp; Satisfied Customer~</li>
            <li> I love it. I have been a wearer of this essential oil fragrance for 25 years&#x27;now and it is getting tough to find a good pure fragrance. This oil is great! ... especially for the price... I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice product. I will be ordering all of my essential oils from this company from now on!  :)</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for fall!  My clients loved it!  And Edens Garden is always a pleasure to work with!</li>
            <li> I am Margaret&#x27;s husband, and it was for me - she had ordered the pathouli oil products. That is, and always be, the most favored fragrance I have ever used. I use it as a bar soap, mix it with other essential fragrances, and get some of the most exotic smells avaiable.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I can smell Patchouli in this oil but it isn&#x27;t like the pure Patchouli oil I have bought in the past. This has more of a perfume smell to it.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff great fragrance getting ready to buy more</li>
            <li> speedy delivery  and the scent is perfect! just like I remembered. very nostalgic.</li>
            <li> love this seller and Great products!!</li>
            <li> I have always used various essential oils, but in haste I purchased patchouli oil at a local store. As they say, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;!  When this therapeutic grade 100% pure essential oil arrived, I knew that I had made the right choice!&lt;br /&gt;We have a rescue kitty that was riddled with fleas! I put a few drops of the patchouli oil on her collar and within a few days, the fleas were gone! And this is after trying all other forms of flea control! Essential oils rock!</li>
            <li> I am a bit of an Eden&#x27;s Garden oil addict. This last order had 18 oils in it. I was in heaven when it got here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells just like patchouli should and diffuses wonderfully! Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect. You only need a tiny bit to enjoy. A lot of essential oils smell cheap, but you can smell the quality in this oil. I like to combine it with their vanilla oil</li>
            <li> Used it in body butter for my DIL. She loved it!</li>
            <li> A Soft unuffending  aroma permeates and radiates all day I ad a couple drops to my hand and body lotion &amp; temples  for great chi energy all day w/0 an ubnoxious lingering aroma.</li>
            <li> It smells good after a half hour or so, but when you first put it on the scent is dusty and hard to bare. Then it smells amazing after that part wears off. good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on a waitress at our local sports bar and loved it - had to ask her what is was. And now I have some of my own from Eden&#x27;s Garden. Thanks, I love the way it smells. I have dabbed this stuff all over my house.</li>
            <li> great service... Love this natural perfume</li>
            <li> ware it every day - love the smell</li>
            <li> Another great oil ! I love Patchouli and this gave more for the price!</li>
            <li> really love this brand- this is the second bottle i&#x27;ve bought, and i just crave the smell.  i add it to everything- my deodorant, shampoo, soap, lotion, hair gel, everything.  i&#x27;ve been using this brand for many months- maybe a year, and cannot say enough about it.  i feel absolutely no need to spend 4-5x more when this one smells so good</li>
            <li> Love it great price just like I remembered</li>
            <li> Not a sweet patchouli smell like I am use to!</li>
            <li> Works great, i put it in my corn holes and it covers up the rancid smell of my BO and Marijuana. Keeps the smell down when im riding in the back seat of a cruiser.</li>
            <li> This oil just came in earlier today. It definitely smells like patchouli, but the scent is VERY concentrated, so I would definitely not suggest wearing more than a tiny drop of it at a time. It lasts long though, unlike a lot of oils and perfumes I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a very musky scent and layers well with others. The seller also shipped it in an extremely timely manner, so I&#x27;m really happy with this. For this price and quality, I have to say that I won&#x27;t be needing to order oils from any other sellers.</li>
            <li> some of the cleanest smelling woody Patchouli I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of bathing with. Mixed beautifully with Cedarwood and bergamot.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time. I will keep ordering this. It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Ah strong scented as nature intended. the strength of the scent in this brand is excellent I&#x27;d buy it again. Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> gotta love this potent stuff.  will last a looonnnggggggg time.  very happy and recommend this to anyone who loves the earthy aroma</li>
            <li> Very happy. Had to contact seller and seller replied fast and professional. Great product.</li>
            <li> No problems...item as described</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best Patchouli oil I have found in years.... good strong earthy aroma ..you do not need to use very much . I wear this as a signature scent and have been wearing patchouli since the early 70&#x27;s ...this reminds me of a blast from the past. How ever you choose to use this product. I highly recommend it. I love it and would give it 10 stars if I could. very fast delivery also and a great informative book came in the box with it....I will be shopping with you soon...Thanks for a grat product</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a diffuser.  Like the scent but for some reason don&#x27;t use it often.  Don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the manufacturer but more to do with personal preference and my mood. Quality appears high.</li>
            <li> The scent of this Patchouli is spot on.  I have seen reviews of this product complaining that it smells like &#x27;dirt&#x27;.  Patchouli is supposed to smell like dirt and true Patchouli lovers know that.  I do not think the scent is too strong either.  There is no such thing!</li>
            <li> love it!  fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I wear it or heat it in the burner</li>
            <li> I love the smell of patchouli but this smells like dirt.</li>
            <li> Love the warmt aroma floating through out my home, just a drop or two on the light bulbs and Wow...sit back and enjoy, better than spray..only thing is i dont like that dropper thingy inside of the Patchouli jar.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best patchouli oils I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my crafting projects at an affordable price</li>
            <li> Great smell, potent and effective.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Rocky Mountain essential oils cost more, but are way more pure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of Patchouli.  In Aromatherapy class, I made a blend with a couple of other oils and it smells wonderful! I still wear Patchouli on a rainy day because I love the earthy smell of it.</li>
            <li> Very earthy, woody, clean, warm. Blended it with cedarwood and ginger.</li>
            <li> This Patchouli is very potent so a very little is all that is needed. I love adding Lavender or Lemon Essential Oil with my Patchouli Oil. It has a very earthy fragrance!</li>
            <li> This just brought me right back to high school. Such nostalgia for patchouli! Not for high school! Love this scent, and &amp;#34;Edens&amp;#34; is quality all the way. Thanks!  - R</li>
            <li> I was quite apprehensive to purchase this product at first because I thought the extremely cheap price was too good to be true. However, once receiving the product and doing a simple sniff test, I was blown away! Superior quality at a fraction of the price of other companies. I will continue to purchase my east jail oils from Edens Garden. Love it!</li>
            <li> My second order.  Love it will order from this seller again and again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting into essential oils and tried different brands.  This brand seems to be low cost but not low value.  I like it and will order again:)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really rich aroma of Patchouli, that is lastly and smells oh so good.  I would definitely recommend this and I will be ordering again one day soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good oil. If you have smelly shoes it helps you refresh them. Also you can renew natural smell of your body.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO Must have oil.</li>
            <li> Just like the oil I got in the 70s</li>
            <li> the oils have helped with the problems that I was having, I have bought more from this sell and would buy more as long as I needed to for other problems.</li>
            <li> A very concentrated oil,will last a long time.</li>
            <li> nice quality, would buy it again</li>
            <li> I Love it. Good Patchouli oil at a good price. This is the official scent of the DJ Booth!  (I have just ordered more!)</li>
            <li> very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It smells great. I love it. Brings me back in to my youth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like Patchouli, but I bought this for my friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with EOs but as far as I can tell it is a nice product. I have used it in some solid perfume recipes. I also used a few drops into a bath and that was nice too.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of patchouli (b/c there are different types) was very strong and heavy smelling.  Almost smelled like old wood in a musty basement.  The &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; is the worst design I have ever seen .... had to put in another &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; dropper bottle.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I mix my own oils for perfume but there is not a local apothecary.  This arrived in a timely manner, well packaged and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This nine patchouly oil out there</li>
            <li> I get this stuff as it make me feel so much love which It I turns attract so much in the form if love to me, love people, love mate relationship, loving  situations.  I haven&#x27;t tested this brand but thus far just smelling It has the same effect as the others.</li>
            <li> I love it I get a lot off complements on how good I smell will order it again thank you</li>
            <li> Too strong and too musty for me. I just need to find scents to add to it to make a nice scent. I was trying to mic a smell from my dog shampoo that I bought from Wholefoods called patchouli spice but I don&#x27;t know what else they mixed in that shampoo. I added this to my dog soap but didn&#x27;t like the smell. Will search until I find good scent partners for this oil.</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden&#x27;s oils,  thanks</li>
            <li> Wow, just purchased this and it is AAhhhhmazing.  Not only did it arrive on time, but it was very nicely wrapped, as well as inlcuded a catalog where I can directly order from the company EDENS GARDEN, whom is FABULOUS.  I will be ordering gifts, kits, sets, for myself and all of my friends and family for gifts.  That&#x27;s how impressed I am.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Patcholi....I place a drop on my light bulbs and the aroma comes forth and gently scents the house...I have friends that have mentioned how my house always smells so nice despite the fact that we have an indoor cat....of course the litter box is promptly attended to...but the Patcholi is a wonderful additive!</li>
            <li> I use this in my shampoo, which has a shelf life so I freeze it in small chunks. The smell hasn&#x27;t faded and I love opening up the jar before every shower to get one out because the smell is amazing. I recommend buying Edens Garden directly through their website, though because you can see it all in one place. Only thing I&#x27;d change is that both purchases I&#x27;ve made from them, they&#x27;ve sent me the same pamphlet and product catalog and it seems like such a waste of paper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for both myself and my mom, we both absolutely love it! First of all, my mom put some of the patchouli oil into a spray bottle and added water to it. Then, she has had a really bad sore on one of her toes that nothing was helping, she started spraying this patchouli oil and water mixture on it, and now that sore is almost completely gone and it no longer hurts. Next, she has a really bad knee that causes her a great deal of pain, (she and I both suffer from fibromyalgia) however, she fell over a year ago and injured her knee but none of the doctors can figure out what the problem is. Anyway, they have prescribed her a pain cream to rub on the knee which she was using but she was not getting much relief. Then, she decided to try the patchouli oil and water mixture. She said that she could not believe it, when she sprayed that on her knee, it started relieving her pain, she absolutely swears by it. I also use it for the pain that I get that goes along with my fibromyalgia. For instance, I went to an outdoor concert one night and without thinking about the fact that I would be on my feet all night (about 6-7 hours), I wore cowboy boots, by the time I came home, my feet and legs hurt so bad, I could not stand it. So, I sprayed my legs and feet with the patchouli oil and water mixture, within just a couple of minutes, my feet and legs felt great. I also know it works great for bug bites and helps stop the itching because, my son had some mosquito bites and for that I just used the straight patchouli oil on them. He said that the itching stopped as soon as I put it on. Therefore, I know this is a great product and I would recommend it to everyone as it is also good for helping even more things than I have spoke about and another plus is that it smells really good!</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Much better quality than the patchouli I bought in my local health food store. Will buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, scent dissipates quickly..I recommend mountainroseherbs.com, very clean and inexpensive organic essential oils. Patchouli and lavender is heaven..just sayin</li>
            <li> Was a gift. They love it.</li>
            <li> Love this one it smells awesome. Nothing but this brand will do for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for several oils and it never fails to impress!</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance. Spot on quality.</li>
            <li> Only need a drop to smell Patchouliful all day long</li>
            <li> Great smell, I use it as perfume</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this scent at all. I love patchouli, but not this one. There was an undertone of something strong and unpleasant to me. I gave mine away.</li>
            <li> this smells pretty horrible, and I like patchouli.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle of patchouli and it does not have a good smell to me, in fact just a medicinal non distinct odor. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil.  Very strong smelling.</li>
            <li> Whoa, is this Strong Patchouli!  I am hoping that it calms down and softens but now it is way too woodsy and pungent and I love Patchouli.  I have to soften it with the Eternal Essence Amber Romance Oil I purchased.  I probably should have gotten the Patchouli at Eternal Essence instead but I tried different places for different oils depending on the reviews.  It&#x27;s not the Patchouli that I have had in the past and I think I&#x27;m going to continue to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONLY PLACE I BUY MY PATCHOULI FROM. BUYING FROM THEM FOR YRS. PURE FORM AND CHEAPEST ON THE MARKET! This is no joke. I love the smell and I usually mix with alcohol in a travel spray bottle and saves me tons on cologne. Been buying from Edens for yrs and you are an &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; to pay for purity as Edens. I am not a employee but 100% is STRONG as F!@k!</li>
            <li> Scent lasted two days.</li>
            <li> i use this oil in my crock pot type oil burner, add a little warm water and simmer...I also add it to a cotton ball and vacuum it up which makes the vacuum bag smell fresh.</li>
            <li> little goes along way so worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> great product and arrive on time</li>
            <li> Smells great, will order again</li>
            <li> It arrived in good condition and is exactly what I was expecting.  I used it so quickly that I purchased the larger size next time.</li>
            <li> I dont find this product to be of a superior nature. Its has a great smell but tends to wafe off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to save money, so I thought I&#x27;d try this brand.  While it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil. The scent was okay mixed with orange and geranium but, on its own, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the tiny bottle I used up last month as a bug repellant. This should last awhile!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It came well packaged and within the specified number of days. It came with instructions and description of the product. It is as described. Good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> This is as pure as it gets . Only need a couple drops on forearm .</li>
            <li> Added some to the car and it was great.</li>
            <li> This oil is long lasting, strong at first but gets lighter in smel. I receive many compliments when wearing this. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil, great price</li>
            <li> I believe the formula changes for these essential oils, and the scent is inconsistent, and sometime has an excessive solvents odor, though I was hoping these had been extracted without solvents or ethanol.</li>
            <li> I like it. I use in my diffuser to freshen the air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely patchouli - very stout and distinctive scent. A little goes a long way, but that&#x27;s usually the case with Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add one drop of this patchouli to about two-three drops of another company&#x27;s rose absolute oil, then add to fractionated coconut oil for my hair and body. The first time I made this concoction, I had added 2-3 drops of the patchouli. I smelled a little too much like a hippie that day, let me tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a day when I&#x27;m nauseated (due to a long-term illness), I place a drop or so of this with ginger oil in a carrier oil, and rub onto my belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my aromatherapy diffuser, I will add about 1-2 drops of this patchouli, about 6 drops of a sandalwood blend, 4 drops of lavender, and 4 drops of the rose absolute. It is a very warm, calming, and sensual scent, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for my boyfriend&#x27;s smelly shoes, I&#x27;ve also added two drops to each shoe. What a difference!</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden!! I have bought several of their oils and I am never disappointed! Great seller! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Not the Patchouli I was hoping for, which is not to say that it isn&#x27;t good, just not for me. A little too earthy and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, for lack of a better word. Kind of like a beer can taste dirty - some people like that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;m very impressed with this oil. It has a very strong and long lasting fragrance. I have already ordered more of their oils. I would recommend it to anyone. Be sure that you get it from Edens Garden. I also appreciate the information that is included with the product, I found it very interesting and helpful.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this when I wear it.  It is supposed to keep mosquitoes away too</li>
            <li> Great quality oil. Not too fond of the smell but that&#x27;s not why I bought it. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> I love how the tip dispenses drops at a time. Lets me be more exact and my oil will last me a long time as well as the prosperity is draws. yey!</li>
            <li> Shipping fast and oil arrived intact.  Is all as described and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil has the most authentic patchouli scent I have ever tried.  It reminds me of my childhood in India where patchouli fragrance intermingled with jasmine and earth to create a heady mixture of olfactory pleasure through the rooms of my parents&#x27; home.  This is the only brand I have found that replicates it perfectly!</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the pachouli oil I like too earthy (smelled like dirt) I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Scent did not last well.  Opened top to bottle and there was still not much patchouli smell.</li>
            <li> has many uses if you go on their website ..it gives you great combinations..</li>
            <li> Bangin azz patchouli!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never wore oils before, I feel the healing, and fighting off the ladies.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend. She loves patchouli so she was very pleased</li>
            <li> Ordered for a gift.  Friend thought it was weak.</li>
            <li> I love it. Need I say more. It smells wonderful and works great in lotion, an oil warmer, in the bathtub, on animals. I put this on my cats and dogs to repell fleas. I also wear it myself because it does smell amazing. I am pleased with the purchases I made from Edens Garden. Great vendor, packaged very well, and shipped promptly. The prices are equivalent to the quality of their products. Excellent stuff I cannot wait to purchase more. I was eyeing up the 39 piece set and then i noticed there are so many more just waiting for me to purchase LOL ;) I must say, I will definitely enjoy ordering from you throughout this year and next year and so on... and updating everyone on the great uses for all of them. I recommend anyone to search online the oil you are looking at and find all it&#x27;s healing properties and everything that you can possibly use it for; you will be amazed. Thank you for your products. Please continue your great work. Happy Holidays.</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the compliment I get from it</li>
            <li> I use this as a perfume oil, and get compliments all the time. I won&#x27;t use any other scent. Natural, subtle, lovely!</li>
            <li> Great oil-use it almost every day..</li>
            <li> nice scent and seems pure.  Dropper runs a little to fast though.  I like to use this in my diffuser</li>
            <li> Does not smell like any patchouli oil I ever bought for my wife over the past 30 years.  I love the smell of patchouli oil when my wife wears it.  This stuff smells like dirt or old leaves.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> i have this oil and most of the others by this brand and i love them all and recommend them</li>
            <li> A gorgeous, true patchouli essential oil. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect well packaged I like all of the scents I have purchased priced right I would recommend this seller and product and I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of fake scents like candles and air fresheners, so I was a little afraid of this scent but when I opened the bottle I was actually disappointed by the weakness of the scent (I smelled the cap as to not overwhelm my nose)</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful, fit perfectly. Will continue to purchase from this Seller. Quality of material is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> strongest patchouli oil I&#x27;ve ever bought. Bottle is full to the brim and despite using it almost every day, still have most of the bottle left.  Love this smell! And what a value!</li>
            <li> I had ordered a kit of oils from another seller and it got mixed up during handling....long story short; i was missing patchouli and decided to reorder THIS from diff seller. Boy was it worth the wait!! I was so disappointed that i didn&#x27;t get my original order of Patchouli, and now i cant stop putting it in EVERYTHING! this product is wonderful! i cant wait to see how good it smells in a few months (if i dont use it all first!!)</li>
            <li> This is my second attempt at getting patchouli oil online. Compared to the other oil I received, this scent is much better. If you like patchoulli, you should like this.</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% pure and the fragrance is beautiful.  Patchouli is a product that blends synergistically .</li>
            <li> I personally, have some kind of a draw towards patchouli. I adore the scent. I found some expensive perfume the other day and when I got it home I read the label and it said it was a blend of patchouli and vanilla. If you like the oils this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil and the scent lasts all day. Only a dab will do it. The product arrived as indicated. Will definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Finally! A patchouli oil that smells how I remember it! Long lasting too! LOVE IT!  Such an intoxicating scent as soon as you open the bottle!  I&#x27;ve tried others and none have ever measured up to the old Spiritual Sky patchouli...but this stuff is perfect!</li>
            <li> First I want to comment on Edens Garden shipping.The shipping is outstanding, I don&#x27;t even have prime and I ordered this oil on Friday and they shipped it out 20 minutes after I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Essential oil itself, I don&#x27;t have any previous experience with patchouli essential oils so I can&#x27;t compare them to any others but my friend made me some soap that had patchouli essential oil in it with French lavender and I absolutley loved the smell so that&#x27;s why I got this patchouli essential oil after doing some research on the company and their oils. Iam pleased with the scent of this patchouli oil, it does remind me of the soap my friend made that I love and I really love the woody and earthy tones of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I actually put 1 drop under my armpits to test the oil out just because I heard patchouli essential oil was good as a deoderant, and before that all day today I have had anxiety and about 15 minutes after I put the oil on, I had noticed I was alot calmer and relaxed! This is my first Edens Garden Essential oil and from this good experience, I will order more from them! :)</li>
            <li> I seems to work well, but the smell of this oil isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again.  It smells so good.</li>
            <li> gives me an  easy high inhaling the sweet vapors.</li>
            <li> Wonderful earthy scent!</li>
            <li> Great smelling for great price!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching oils before deciding which to purchase, and read a lot of reviews and opinions through different medium.  the worst complaints that I read were &amp;#34;Eden&#x27;s Garden doesn&#x27;t grow their own plants therefore cannot control the outcome&amp;#34;.  I suppose that&#x27;s an issue if you plan to drink it...I&#x27;m cleaning with it.  Someone complained that the products &amp;#34;don&#x27;t come with a dropper&amp;#34; - there is a dropper, it just isn&#x27;t the one Americans are accustomed to.  The tube is inside of the bottle, with a cap ontop that allows you to control  drops just as effectively as using an eye dropper, and less chance of knocking over and spilling the contents.  I purchased to use in conjunction with Cedarwood , and am very happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Great quality!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Marla-Buchanan/e/B00JVBLL66</li>
            <li> Auro Casia Patchouli Oil and it was so nice.  It smelled like pure Patchouli oil.  This brand smells like chemicals and a bit like charred wood.  You can smell a hint of the Patchouli, but the initial scent is the charred wood scent.  Weird.  I will stay with Auro Casia from now on, or any other brand that smells like pure Patchouli.  It&#x27;s hard to tell how the oils offered here on Amazon are going to smell though.  It&#x27;s better to buy in person so you can at least smell them.  For anyone reading the reviews though, I can guarantee that Auro Casia brand will be authentic.</li>
            <li> Nice non-perfuming scent</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to get past because it&#x27;s over powering but that&#x27;s just the oil itself. It&#x27;s a great quality and works wonders</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mother&#x27;s 70th birthday as she loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled like dirt...wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but that could be my fault if this is what it is supposed to smell like. Price was reasonable for size.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, and so do my friends and family. I use it handmade soaps and my customers always compliment the fragrance.  Brings them back to the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very strong, but a little goes a long way!  Great packaging insert with interesting oil tips and information included.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> On time, smells wonderful, blended with Jasmine, it smells like a costly perfume that stays with you all day!</li>
            <li> WOW- Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell. I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet... awesome! I recommend this company and their products!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!! It is so concentrated you only need a drop and it smells so good! I am using it in a recipe for a hair treatment and it blends so well and the combination is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Patchouli 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil is an excellent product. I bought several bottles from various vendors. This went to one member of my family and so far only good reviews.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ALRIGHT, ADD TO SKIN OIL.</li>
            <li> This is some of the strongest Patchouli oil that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It can even be diluted or used in homemade salt scrub for a scent that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> absolutely enchanting. I use it instead of expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Company good to deal with, so far</li>
            <li> This is a good oil for anyone who uses essential oils. It&#x27;s one of those scents that either you love it or you hate it- most love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly! Great product!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Patchouli</li>
            <li> always have loved this scent and this one is a little more woodsy but when you apply it, it smells just right and love Edens Garden company very pleased with their service and product! At first thought the bottle was small but this is PURE oil so you need very little of it to apply, so it will last a long time !!</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender. I was looking for a 100% pure oil. I was a little spectacle being that its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person. You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing. Well OH am I pleased I followed my gutt. This is why I am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I recieved my lavender, which came two days of ordering. Once you open that top OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil. It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses. It has a built in droplet top so you can easily use and not spill. I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product and if I was pleased. She also asked for an email for discounts on future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have purchased Ylang Ylang which blends lovely with my Lavender. Tumeric, Patchouli and Clove have been added to my collection. I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure. My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use. I also have had recent surgery and my scar is getting lighter with the mix of clove with tumeric and I dilute with 100% coconut oil that I purchased elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I love my oils and I thank god I followed my gutt and found Edens Garden Essential Oils. My next purchase will be the 14 bottle of 10ml synergy blends. I cant wait for that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all 5stars on delivery, customer service and product. For those who complain about scent its all on self opinion. Scents vary from person to person. Every oil has their distinct aroma. Whatever oil you purchase that is what it will smell like. Like my clove yea it smells just like clove as does tumeric smells of tumeric. Your getting what your purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love patchouli and this is a good product but not quite like the patchouli I&#x27;m used to. But when used in moderation, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong, and VERY unpleasant. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to describe it as. It smells like a cloyingly sweet spiced dirtiness. Not musky or earthy at all. Very strange.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.This is what I remember Patchouli being back in the 60s. Kind of dates me, but just know it is wonderful. No need to pay a lot more from home parties .Edens garden has wonderful produ ts.</li>
            <li> Goes on strong but is actually more subtle than I expected. Not too sweet, which is good.</li>
            <li> This scent takes me back to the 70s with gusto! I have used it both on my body and on my lamp rings and find the scent to be pure without being overpowering.  The price and prompt delivery were great!</li>
            <li> I love this therapeutic oil</li>
            <li> Not what i actually wanted but it is an essential oil you can def tell its pure, will be adding this to lotions and such!</li>
            <li> An excellent essential oil.....a little goes a long way....Many memories of the 1960&#x27;s....Far Out!!!!!</li>
            <li> just remember when purchasing this product it is very powerful and it needs to be diluted. you judge for yourself it last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice indeed! This scent is very true to the memories I have a patchouli. It calms me and makes me feel very happy. The shipping was quick and hassle free as well.</li>
            <li> Patchouli oil is far out. Provides a stimulus for a cool, mellow vibe. Peace, love, and happiness is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> this product speaks for itself. it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s musky, it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s seductive, it&#x27;s sultry. it&#x27;s patchouli. the price is unbeatable, too. i combined this with lime and bergamot for a divine fragrance. so uplifting.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil. The smells stays on like forever lol. I&#x27;ve never smelled Patchouli before buying this so I didn&#x27;t know. But after I smelled it, it&#x27;s not for me. It&#x27;s rather too strong for me and makes me feel dizzy. But I&#x27;m sure this will cure some people&#x27; dizziness since everyone&#x27;s different !~ ^^</li>
            <li> I love it, quality, grade A essential oil!!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I wear this as perfume and deodrant and its sooooooo amazing. Im in love with patchouli!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this numerous times now and I&#x27;m very pleased. I get lots of compliments throughout the day on how I smell...haha</li>
            <li> Sorry, but to be honest that smell yucky. No me gusto el olor de este perfume huele feo disculpen, gracias</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Patchouli I have ever used! I am over the moon excited about it. It&#x27;s a tad stronger then I am use to but I just use a drop less then usual. It was packaged with a super cool product guide on all the essential oils the company offers, as well as a book on 101 ways to use essential oils. I would deff recommend this product and company!!!</li>
            <li> Very good aroma. I love patchouli. This is authentic. However the drops come out too slowly.</li>
            <li> By far the best patchouli I ever had. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. The speed by which it was received, and the items enclosed with the purchase. (i.e. catalog, 101 ways to use oil, and receipt. ) thank you.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my needs</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, as described.</li>
            <li> I have many allegies to scents, perfumes, etc. I love the scent of Patchouli but not everyone gets it right. This bottle I got arrived right away, it was a FANTSTIC price and it smells wonderful -no suffocating scent and no migraine for me!</li>
            <li> Smells like it should..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t much care for this, not the sellers fault at all! I didn&#x27;t know what Patchouli smelled like and wanted to try it, just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what I remember from my teens during the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.  As I&#x27;m typing this I&#x27;m playing old Cream songs in my head.  :-)  (Sunshine of your Love, White Room).</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Smells like real, true patchouli, not the crap some folks wore when I was in high school. Pleasant.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LOVED THE SMELL OF THIS SINCE MY BROTHER HAD IT AROUND IN THE 70&#x27;S..THIS IS THE MOST UNIQUE SMELL AND IT DOES ATTRACT PEOPLE TO IT..LOL..USE IT FOR EVERYTHING..EVEN WITH COTTON BALLS IN MY VENTS!!</li>
            <li> Excellant essential oils!  I am using these oils in my homemade healthy bar soap</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take much to do what you might what to do with it..perhaps a number of things that will come to interests, i am using for aromatherapy..perhaps a drop or two, in your existing colone collections</li>
            <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!! highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This brand is not the best quality, but I didnt pay too much for it. The smell is a musty smooth patchouli, but I prefer a smooth sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I love Patchouli!!!!!!  Just a good basic essential oil.  I always buy Edens Garden in every oil.</li>
            <li> Very impressed w/ the Patchouli, high quality, smells great ! I dab a very small amount on my neck and wrist-sticks with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shipping and seller included very helpful and nice pamplets, I Love the fact that this company appears to be Christian based....I will definitly support my bro/sis in the future!</li>
            <li> I am a Patchouli user since 1969.I have tried many brands since my older brand changed it&#x27;s formula a bit.This is some of the best yet.Great  original patch.Will buy again.fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is a nice smelling wood base note that isnt too light or heavy, it is slightly sweet and makes a good masculine base.</li>
            <li> Great scents!  This will be where I buy my oils from now on.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it in a diffuser and as an additive to lotion. Smells great in the diffuser. When using in a lotion, it smells funky at first, but then great the rest of the day and last until I shower again. I add a few drops to lotion and I smell delicious all day!</li>
            <li> I had a couple  compliments  when i wore it, it was recognized  as patchouli.  To me  it had a bit of a lysol scent.</li>
            <li> This really is pure. It is brilliant, loud, and rich with the correct smell. No dilution noted here.</li>
            <li> Right now the aroma of this particular brand of patchouli is a little too sharp instead of warm, and there is no sweet lingering scent. It does indeed remind me of dirt instead of a pleasant earthy scent. I bought this primarily for its benefits, not so much for the scent, but it is hard to wear compared to other brands of Patchouli EO. Patchouli is supposed to get better as it ages. I&#x27;ll put this away for a while and see if the scent changes to something less dirt-like with time.</li>
            <li> I always order from Edens Garden, love the oils, they work well together, and 99% of the time they come in unbroken</li>
            <li> Love the smell of patchoulli!  ThispProduct is as promised.  Eden Gardens provided great customer service!  I would order from Eden Gardens again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works perfect in my oil diffuser! I have purchased other scents from Edens Garden and I haven&#x27;t found one I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The one I got smelled really bad...not even like dirt. At first I was hoping that once it &#x27;breathes&#x27;, it might smell like it is suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;It still stank. It just smells old and stale.</li>
            <li> excellent essential oils, good pricing here</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this one, so I use it wherever and whenever I can, it gives the other oils I use a more distinct and sweet smell the kind I like!</li>
            <li> Love the smell put it in your defuses, and enjoy the smell...</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent and this brand seems to be the closest to the ones I bought in the 70&#x27;s. It lasts on my skin all day and people remark about it even late in the day after I have worn it since early morning</li>
            <li> Love this product. I lost my first one, and a few months later purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> I  love EDENS GARDEN! I have a plethora of oils now that I use for my face...moderate acne and acne scars. I am so glad that I found out about the use of oils and I hope they continue to be such a great experience. I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)... Give EO&#x27;s a try if you have been battling acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> this has a terrible smell, it is not patchouli. it is only therapeutic to the sellers bank account</li>
            <li> Smell awesome. I love it and I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> The price was amazing. It met my expectations. I would recommend this product to any one who is into essential oils, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not very scented and smells kinda weird.</li>
            <li> compared to other brands it&#x27;s tops</li>
            <li> I have dabbled in and out of using EO&#x27;s for about 10 years or so, and also having used them periodically in soap making. So now that the use of EO&#x27;s for aromatherapy and alternative healing has really exploded in popularity, I decided to reinvest my interests in this very interesting approach to health &amp; wellbeing.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare Eden&#x27;s Garden to any of the YL or DT oils, for personally, I&#x27;m not even going to go there. It&#x27;s insane what some of those oils are priced at, for what they are actually worth.&lt;br /&gt;What I can say about EG oils, is that they are really pretty great! I ordered several from them in one order, and was pleased with the entire order. This particular oil, is just as patchouli is supposed to be. Color, fragrance, and feel. The scent lingers on for days with this one. I dabbed just a couple of drops on my neck one evening before bed, and my nighty t-shirt carried that scent for about three days. No skin irritation whatsoever. Very authentic smelling, just as it did even in the 70&#x27;s &amp; early 80&#x27;s when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciated the fast shipping as well as the professional packaging. They included a very nice &amp; detailed product guide with all of the oils/sets they offer. The product guide lists all their oils by botanical name, as well as how and when they are useful. I&#x27;m not sure about an included statement, that their oils are &amp;#34;A -graded&amp;#34;. According to certified/licensed aromatherapists there is no &amp;#34;grading&amp;#34; of essential oils, and that all EO&#x27;s are considered &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34;. Quality however is between the supplier and distributer. So, I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I think I can definitely overlook it! I did like their company &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; and that they donate 10% of their profits to charity. They also included a pamphlet with lots of blending ideas &amp; instructions for different applications specific to the body &amp; home. I am overall very impressed with this company and their products. So much actually, that several days later I purchased four of their synergy blends. Those haven&#x27;t arrived just yet, however I&#x27;m sure they will be awesome!t several days later I purchased four of their synergy blends. Those haven&#x27;t arrived just yet, however I&#x27;m sure they will be awesome!</li>
            <li> Very nice. I love my patchouli. I&#x27;ve had different brand and this one is about stronger but it&#x27;s pure grade. It&#x27;s so nice when your out with friends and someone will walk by of on the dance floor say to their friends, wow did you catch that, some someone smells really nice. Makes me smile big :-D  I will say that&#x27;s me it&#x27;s patchouli!!!!</li>
