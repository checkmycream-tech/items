            <li>These are perfect for my 18 month little girl with lots of hair!</li>
            <li>They are super soft, stretchy and bright.</li>
            <li>Originally I got them for my brother-in-law&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li>but when i recive them I found out the flower realy good and big as I like</li>
            <li>I love that the flowers can be detached from the band for older kids.</li>
            <li>and they look adorable on my lil 2 year old!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>

            <li>It clearly states the flowers are clip on and you can remove them from the headband which is exactly why I purchased them.  </li>
            <li>, I would have given them a 5 star rating for the product because they were very cute and they arrived before the estimated shipping date, but due to the fact not as described I only gave it a 2.</li>
            <li>A couple of them have a slight bend in the petals, but they flatten pretty easily.</li>

            <li> Would not purchase again the petals were all bent and there was glue on top of the rhinestones and petals was very disappointed !</li>
            <li> From the pucture, i thought the flower small</li>
            <li> This is not true!!!!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how comfortable they are bc my niece is always taking them off, but she is less than a year old. Good construction and very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my photography business and the parents absolutely adores them. They are great with all ages of children</li>
            <li> Really pretty and nice flower bands. Would like to have more color variety. I would recommend this item. Nice and cute.</li>
            <li> These headbands are very cute and it&#x27;s great that they come in a variety of colors.  The rhinestone in the middle is a little big and make them look a little bit cheap.  I can&#x27;t complain for the price though because it was cheaper to buy these than to make them!</li>
            <li> Love these And they fit perfect on my baby!</li>
            <li> I love the way they look on my twin girls.. So many come in the pack to go with every outfit</li>
            <li> My baby hates things on her head but these bows make her look so beautiful and cute. Everyone adores her with these bows on. They are well made and they will go with any outfit she has.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these headbands! I have a 3 yr old daughter who will absolutely die when she opens these for Christmas and I have twin girls on the way who will look adorable with these. They are super soft, stretchy and bright. The flowers are glued on to the headband so you can&#x27;t switch them out but that&#x27;s totally fine by me. They seem like they would fit any size head. So I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy more for my girls and for gifts.</li>
            <li> These are very cute headbands but the description is VERY misleading.  It clearly states the flowers are clip on and you can remove them from the headband which is exactly why I purchased them.  This is not true!!!!  I purchased these assuming the description was correct and liked that I could use the headbands with other bows I already have; which obviously isn&#x27;t the case.  I now had to purchase additional headbands.  I contacted the seller and informed them and they apologized and said they made a mistake in uploading the description.  I also saw a previous review in March 2014 that stated the same thing I stated, so it really baffles me why the wrong description still remained when I purchased!  They offered me a $2 refund and due to hassle in returning I choose to keep them.  I asked them to please update their description so that others would not be mislead and they assured me they removed their listing.  However, here it is when I clicked on it to write a review.  They only thing that seemed to change was the name of the seller!  Honestly, IF the description stated was honest and stated really what you got, I would have given them a 5 star rating for the product because they were very cute and they arrived before the estimated shipping date, but due to the fact not as described I only gave it a 2.</li>
            <li> I paid $14.66 for these in September 2013.  Great price for what you get!  These are perfect for my 18 month little girl with lots of hair!</li>
            <li> The flowers are clipped on as described but the flowers are not soft and the colors are not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Love all the color but the flower is to big specially for infants but maybe for older girls it k..</li>
            <li> The description is wrong for this item, the flowers are hot glued on and not detachable like the seller states. Otherwise, they look good, I just wish they were detachable like they are described.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again the petals were all bent and there was glue on top of the rhinestones and petals was very disappointed !</li>
            <li> My daughter will actually keep these in her hair. Originally I got them for my brother-in-law&#x27;s wedding but now she wears one almost every day</li>
            <li> Great buy and a great price! Fit my nieces head perfectly. Love all the different variety of colors they give you</li>
            <li> Everyone is saying that these don&#x27;t come apart, but the ones I received have flower clips attached to their matching headbands and none of them are glued on. They are perfect both together and separate. A couple of them have a slight bend in the petals, but they flatten pretty easily. and they look adorable on my lil 2 year old! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I got my first set of head bands and was not satisfied. I got 3 reds 3 blues 2 purples 2 browns 1 pink and 1 white. And the flowers where glued on. I contacted the seller and they where super nice and resent the head bands free of charge and I got all 12 colors and the flowers all clip on!! Great people to deal with :)</li>
            <li> I love theses hair bands its the second set ive baught my little girl looks so cute and theirs about a color for every outfit</li>
            <li> I got these in no time! I love that the flowers can be detached from the band for older kids. I have gotten so many compliments on them and the kids love using them for photo props. Great buy for the money</li>
            <li> These are very cute but the description says that they come with a clip for easy removal. Mine came today and the flowers are glued to the headband. The only reason that I bought these ones is because the description said that the flowers could be removed.</li>
            <li> They are so beautiful. This kit has almost all color. The flower is big. I like big flowers. From the pucture, i thought the flower small but when i recive them I found out the flower realy good and big as I like</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  The headband is soft on my babies head and the daisies are big and cute.  The 12 assorted color bands make it easy to combine with different colored outfits.</li>
