            <li>ITS SO CUTE AND HOLDS SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>These are really, really cheaply made items.</li>
            <li>Overall great make up case.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with their products.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to order this as a gift for an up and coming make up artist and whent</li>
            <li>I love this case sooo much!</li>
            <li>I love all the designs that Shany offers for their train cases, but this one is probably my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li>I took one good look at the case out of the box, and put it back in for return.</li>
            <li>It looks good, but as stated earlier by another reviewer, it is flimsy.</li>
            <li>VERY!!</li>
            <li>It makes is so nice if I have more or less that I want to bring with me!</li>
            <li>The packaged shipped extremely quick and I was very excited to open it and take a peek before packing it up and gift wrapping it...</li>
            <li>I have bought several items from SHANY and they all began falling apart after the first use, for the most part.</li>
            <li>love the leppord print and the case has enough room for everything.</li>
            <li>When I got this the first thing</li>
            <li>very roomy!</li>
            <li>Wow I loved the black professional rolling makeup case but this leopard case is so cute</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main attraction!</li>
            <li>To my astonishment, there was a huge scratch on the front of the entire case</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Really highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>Very spacious.</li>
            <li>It is made very well.</li>
            <li>So, in other words, i bought this as more of a stationary orginizational tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reside in New Jersey, so it goes without saying that I was sold on the leopard print!  </li>
            <li>Brought this for my older sister in beauty school, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>This rolling case not only super cute, but it is high quality and will pay for itself in little to no time.</li>
            <li>A professional&#x27;s dream!</li>
            <li>it is so big and compact and the top half is removable</li>
            <li>It makes you look like an professional makeup artist and also it helps with being organize and neat.</li>
            <li>I am a professional, and this wouldn&#x27;t last a week for all the money I paid.</li>
            <li>This item arrived with SEVERAL HUGE and various small dents all along the aluminum edges.</li>
            <li>It had a VERY FLIMSY handle and was smaller then expected.</li>

            <li> The interior was horribly manufactured, all of the foam lining was detatching from the structure and one of the slide out trays was busted... could it have been previously used?  </li>

            <li> This item arrived with SEVERAL HUGE and various small dents all along the aluminum edges. It had a VERY FLIMSY handle and was smaller then expected. I am a professional, and this wouldn&#x27;t last a week for all the money I paid. I took one good look at the case out of the box, and put it back in for return. I have bought several items from SHANY and they all began falling apart after the first use, for the most part. These are really, really cheaply made items. I am not just disappointed, I am now angry to have spent and WASTED so much money with this brand. I didn&#x27;t bother sending the other stuff back but I should have! I am never buying from this brand SHANY again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ll leave truthful and honest reviews about the other crap I bought before too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARRRGGGH!</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister, as a christmas present. When it arrived, it had an indentaion on one side that made it a little difficult to snap back on, however i fixed(cuz im so handy). I shouldnt have had to fix it, but things happen. im just glad that was all that was messed up. It looks good, but as stated earlier by another reviewer, it is flimsy. If you want a traveling train case i wouldnt recommend this. I bought this for my sis b/c she has a great deal of make-up &amp; figured she wanted a nice funky way of putting all her stuff away. So, in other words, i bought this as more of a stationary orginizational tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, its good to keep everything together, great design, but no travelling with it, unless you want your make-up all over the place.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my older sister in beauty school, and she loves it. She stores her supplies and tools inside of it at home. Because there are sometimes that she just has to keep at her place in order to do her homework and other assignments. Overall great make up case.</li>
            <li> Another excellent case from Shany. I am never disappointed with their products. Super durable and allows you to easily organize your products!</li>
            <li> So I was excited to order this as a gift for an up and coming make up artist and whent they received it it was broken.  Lining was ripped and wheels broken.&lt;br /&gt;I got a replacement and that one was worse! ughh and it is so nice looking too bad the quality control people arent paying attention. and NO it didnt get damaged in transit because the outside box was in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> it is so big and compact and the top half is removable i love the print and hope they can make a smaller one LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Leopard print things and when I take this on jobs people always ask where did I buy it from! It&#x27;s the main attraction!</li>
            <li> love the leppord print and the case has enough room for everything. The top is also removable. Awsome case. I love it</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and I loved it. It&#x27;s very good quality and very strong and hold everything very well</li>
            <li> It makes you look like an professional makeup artist and also it helps with being organize and neat. Not a fan of leopard though.</li>
            <li> This rolling case not only super cute, but it is high quality and will pay for itself in little to no time. The wheels are absolutely perfect and the handles are very sturdy. Would def recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for a semi-professional makeup artist as a gift.  I reside in New Jersey, so it goes without saying that I was sold on the leopard print!  The packaged shipped extremely quick and I was very excited to open it and take a peek before packing it up and gift wrapping it... To my astonishment, there was a huge scratch on the front of the entire case (the leopard print exterior is actually a form of decal, which was peeling off).  As I proceded to open the case for further inspection, I noticed the black painted hardware was all scratched up as well.  The interior was horribly manufactured, all of the foam lining was detatching from the structure and one of the slide out trays was busted... could it have been previously used?  I do not know; but amazon&#x27;s listing said it was \\&quot;new\\&quot;.  This item is very poorly constructed and I doubt would take very well to travelling (which it is designed to be used for).  If I could have given this product a lesser star rating, I would.  The company, SHANY, has a very poor reputation in my book.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM, no matter how cute you think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Amazon will be refunding me, but now I have to start back at square one of my gift hunt...</li>
            <li> I love the print and it hold a lot of my makeup, my friends all love the case and ordered one.</li>
            <li> I love this. All of it. It&#x27;s portable. And it&#x27;s so cute! The leopard is my fave, and what girl doesn&#x27;t love animal print!</li>
            <li> I love all the designs that Shany offers for their train cases, but this one is probably my favorite out of all of them. I love how spacious that cases are. I can take my collection with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> This is my ideal case! Its cute, has room to hold all my make up needs, I can roll it, it&#x27;s light weight, I can organize my makeup easily. What else could I want?</li>
            <li> Wow I loved the black professional rolling makeup case but this leopard case is so cute and it is at the same price!</li>
            <li> I love the leopard print case! It&#x27;s great for all of my makeup and I love how I can unstack them! It makes is so nice if I have more or less that I want to bring with me! A professional&#x27;s dream!</li>
            <li> When I got this the first thing I though of was Khloe Kardashian! haha I love this case sooo much! the packaging was great and the look of it is amazing! I love Leopardddddddddd! Really highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> its a very cute print and had no troubles with mine. i took very good care of it! very roomy!</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THIS LEOPARD CASE!! ITS SO CUTE AND HOLDS SO MUCH!! DID I MENTION IT WAS CUTE!!! YES!! VERY!! ITS SO BIG...I HAVE A LOT OF MAKEUP AND THIS CASE HOLDS IT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> How can you not love this case! I love that its leopard, and I love that I can take all my stuff whenever I need it and not have to worry about anything getting messed up. I love it. Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> This train case is absolutely beautiful. Very spacious. It is made very well. Great for makeup artists or makeup enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> I ordered this case for my daughter in June.  She is a cosmetology student and needed a good case for all her supplies.  We have had it around 6 months and all four wheels are bent and will not roll any longer!&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy another Shany case!</li>
