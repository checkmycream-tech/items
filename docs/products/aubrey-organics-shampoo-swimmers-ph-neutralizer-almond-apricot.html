            <li>The shampoo seems to have kept my hair in good condition (no chlorine smell!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up, as it contains no surfactants -- but that&#x27;s probably a good thing for your hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for removing salts from perspiration, if you exercise strenuously.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Yves Rocher had a great product but doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I was a great fan of the Kiss</li>
            <li>works great to get the chlorine out of the hair...</li>
            <li>great smelling too</li>
            <li>worked beautifully to keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell too!</li>
            <li>This product smells really good.</li>
            <li>I swim frequently and this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found to remove chlorine and restore shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>, her hair seems better than not using it.</li>
            <li>and A TOTAL STRANGER WALKED UP TO ME IN THE STORE AND TOLD ME MY HAIR WAS BEAUTIFUL AND ASKED WHAT TYPE OF SHAMPOO I USED!</li>
            <li>This stuff made my scalp and hair incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li>They love the smell and it feels like it washes away the chlorine because the chlorine smell is gone after the wash.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I am putting on more chemicals on top of the chlorine.</li>
            <li>Once simple, creamy, and delicious, it&#x27;s now more watery.</li>
            <li>Love this for getting chlorine out of hair.</li>
            <li>Have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for more than two years.</li>
            <li>I also am pleased that it&#x27;s vegan and biodegradeable.</li>
            <li>Like most shampoos it does clean your hair so I will keep looking.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair and did just fine with it though.</li>
            <li>and it makes my daughters&#x27; hair smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made for light colored hair because I think it lightens your hair a tad with the citric acid in it.</li>
            <li>Those ones do make hair smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and find it a great product.</li>
            <li>But I cannot say it did much to smooth my hair or improve its texture.</li>
            <li>It has a strong sweet fragrance which stayed with my hair hours after using it, making me queasy and making me sneeze.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent (and I can be quite sensitive to scents), it cleans well and gently, and it pairs nicely with their conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells like sweet almond cookies.</li>
            <li>When I started swimming again 7-8 weeks ago, I decided to give it a try since I hadn&#x27;t found a shampoo that I loved and it was on sale at my local co-op (a sign!).  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a decent shampoo with great ingredients but</li>
            <li>I have no idea why they would change the formula for such a popular product.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday after swimming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem get any chlorine out and my children&#x27;s hair is still rough, apt to tangle and brittle afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The old formula with the corn syrup was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Really has helped my hair!</li>
            <li>You can buy it for similar price at Whole Foods, but the practicality of getting it by your door is much better.</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps you clean for 24 hours, it is meant to be use everyday, so do not expect to have no-oily skull for more than 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the shampoo, it has a strong, fruity scent that is not entirely agreeable to me.</li>
            <li>Its ok but not as good as other swim shampoo I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it really does keep my hair from turning greenish after I swim in a chlorinated pool two to four times a week.</li>
            <li>I do not have Whole Foods where I live now.  </li>
            <li>probably try something else next, and come back to this if we don&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the ULTRA SWIM DYNAMIC DUO REPAIR Shampoo as it works much better overall.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty much the same, but I have to use twice as much as before.</li>
            <li>It is good for me because I have short hair, but may last long for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only draw back to this shampoo is that it&#x27;s good for dry hair</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, when I was younger, Suave shampoo (the one like \\&quot;Flex\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>The old formula made my hair soft with pretty curls.</li>
            <li>This shampoo came up on my radar when I was looking for a new shampoo, preferably one that was biodegradeable.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stand the new formula with the rice extract.</li>
            <li>I have very healthy shiny hair, so I can only conclude that this shampoo is not good for my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair so  soft and shiny that people complimented me on it</li>
            <li>and I grew my long, straight brown hair to waist length while using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that is a dark brown color.</li>
            <li>The new formula leaves my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>the strong scent and high price tag make it unlikely that I will repurchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>All natural, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li>My Face everyday shampoo until they switched the scent from grapefruit and eucalyptus to lime (too much like life savers and too strong---plus the conditioner just plain smells funny).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The kid doesn&#x27;t like it, and we bought it because she has weekly swim lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, her hair seems better than not using it. A bit. Nothing miraculously different, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll probably try something else next, and come back to this if we don&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like sweet almond cookies. Smells like food. It&#x27;s made for light colored hair because I think it lightens your hair a tad with the citric acid in it. I have brown hair and did just fine with it though. It seemed to make my hair grow faster than had previously happened with other shampoos and I grew my long, straight brown hair to waist length while using this shampoo. This shampoo made my hair so  soft and shiny that people complimented me on it and A TOTAL STRANGER WALKED UP TO ME IN THE STORE AND TOLD ME MY HAIR WAS BEAUTIFUL AND ASKED WHAT TYPE OF SHAMPOO I USED! This stuff made my scalp and hair incredibly healthy. I then saw her hunting for this shampoo in the aisles! The only draw back to this shampoo is that it&#x27;s good for dry hair but if your hair is average or oily it won&#x27;t make it any less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month.  I think that it is getting chlorine out of my hair and it&#x27;s made my hair soft, but the shampoo is real thin and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price. I&#x27;ve also used Suave&#x27;s Clarifying shampoo and it works just as well and is about $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, you have to shake it real hard to use it. I use it after my daughters swimming class. They love the smell and it feels like it washes away the chlorine because the chlorine smell is gone after the wash. This was the only one I could find with a reasonable price without harsh chemicals. One thing though I dont know the bottle is leaking or not but even if I close the cap real tightly it always feels slippery.  As of September, 2015, I conclude that I still want to use this one over other shampoos which have all other chemicals. Those ones do make hair smooth but I feel like I am putting on more chemicals on top of the chlorine. With Aubrey Organic shampoo, after the wash, hairs do get coarse and tangled. So I use kiss my face conditioner and it makes my daughters&#x27; hair smooth and easy to comb. That is all need from the shampoo. I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I swim frequently and this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found to remove chlorine and restore shine to my hair. It&#x27;s also great for removing salts from perspiration, if you exercise strenuously.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this shampoo. it was a recommendation from my sister. You can buy it for similar price at Whole Foods, but the practicality of getting it by your door is much better. I do not have Whole Foods where I live now.  This shampoo keeps you clean for 24 hours, it is meant to be use everyday, so do not expect to have no-oily skull for more than 24 hrs.  I like it a lot</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but me and my hair feel passionately about this one. Once simple, creamy, and delicious, it&#x27;s now more watery. It smells pretty much the same, but I have to use twice as much as before. The shampoo change isn&#x27;t as devastating as the conditioner change. But still so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this for getting chlorine out of hair. Have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and find it a great product. All natural, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This review is for the swimmers shampoo. I have long, fine hair that is a dark brown color. I was worried about chlorine damage since I swim four times a week so I picked up this shampoo and conditioner. Regarding the shampoo, it has a strong, fruity scent that is not entirely agreeable to me. The consistency is very thin, so much so that I only apply a little at a time to avoid waste. The shampoo seems to have kept my hair in good condition (no chlorine smell!) and prevented discoloration (my grays are still gray!). But I cannot say it did much to smooth my hair or improve its texture. Overall, it is a decent shampoo with great ingredients but the strong scent and high price tag make it unlikely that I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo. I used it for the first time yesterday after swimming. It does not lather. It has a strong sweet fragrance which stayed with my hair hours after using it, making me queasy and making me sneeze. It did not seem to help my hair at all; rather, my hair was dry and dull. I have very healthy shiny hair, so I can only conclude that this shampoo is not good for my hair. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not as good as other swim shampoo I have used in the past. Despite shaking the product before use I still find it runny.</li>
            <li> This product smells really good. It also has improved my hair and skin over time. The only issue is that because it is organic and does not have any sulfate products, it doesn&#x27;t not lather well. It is good for me because I have short hair, but may last long for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two of my kids hair that are competitive swimmers.  It doesn&#x27;t seem get any chlorine out and my children&#x27;s hair is still rough, apt to tangle and brittle afterwards.  I&#x27;d recommend the ULTRA SWIM DYNAMIC DUO REPAIR Shampoo as it works much better overall.</li>
            <li> Leaves a waxy feeling... Not for me thank you. Like most shampoos it does clean your hair so I will keep looking. Yves Rocher had a great product but doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore. It was Phyto Soleil after sun shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for more than two years. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it really does keep my hair from turning greenish after I swim in a chlorinated pool two to four times a week. It doesn&#x27;t lather up, as it contains no surfactants -- but that&#x27;s probably a good thing for your hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo came up on my radar when I was looking for a new shampoo, preferably one that was biodegradeable.  When I started swimming again 7-8 weeks ago, I decided to give it a try since I hadn&#x27;t found a shampoo that I loved and it was on sale at my local co-op (a sign!).  The shampoo kept the chlorine out of my hair for a few weeks, but the chlorine has since taken its toll.  (I swim 4 times a week.)  I also use the conditioner, and a deep conditioning with it has helped to soothe my hair.  I finally got a swimming cap, and I will continue to use this shampoo.  It has a nice, light scent (and I can be quite sensitive to scents), it cleans well and gently, and it pairs nicely with their conditioner.  I also am pleased that it&#x27;s vegan and biodegradeable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, when I was younger, Suave shampoo (the one like \\&quot;Flex\\&quot;) worked beautifully to keep my hair in good condition.  I was a great fan of the Kiss My Face everyday shampoo until they switched the scent from grapefruit and eucalyptus to lime (too much like life savers and too strong---plus the conditioner just plain smells funny).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand the new formula with the rice extract. The old formula with the corn syrup was fantastic. The new formula leaves my hair dry and brittle. The old formula made my hair soft with pretty curls. I have no idea why they would change the formula for such a popular product. Very disappointing. Now I&#x27;m in search of another brand.</li>
            <li> works great to get the chlorine out of the hair...great smelling too</li>
            <li> Really has helped my hair! I swim 5-6 days a week-hair was beginning to feel like straw! Nice smell too!</li>
