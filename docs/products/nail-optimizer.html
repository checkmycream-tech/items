    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best product.</li>
            <li>wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent products I saw a difference after seven days</li>
            <li>Just great and strengthens nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been stronger or more beautiful!</li>
            <li>I bought Nail Optimizer at a hair salon and just loved it.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been as good.  </li>
            <li>My manicurist has stated each visit how beautiful and strong my once pitiful nails are now.  </li>
            <li>I use her to shape them, plus I love the hand and arm massage!  </li>
            <li>Works great, helps nail stay strong and grow</li>
            <li>A great product to help your nails get strong.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nails so nice and hardens them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I kind of think, not???</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, awesome product wouldn&#x27;t be without it actually use it every day for awesome nails.  </li>
            <li>and I have great success with it.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, my nails have all been growing out with the help of this treatment, and out of 10 fingernails, I now have 8 really strong, growing nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue it till the bottle is empty, hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>My original formula was in a frosted bottle...not sure if that impacts the efficacy of the product, however.</li>
            <li>For a year my formerly strong nails had been chipping and splitting.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this procuct.</li>
            <li>My nails appear white on the tips and are very healthy LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my nails stronger and make my hands look pretty.</li>
            <li>Just found my original formula bottle and applied that to my nails yesterday as my first go-round with the &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t seem to produce the results that the original formula (and my past experience with this superb product) produced.</li>
            <li>After several weeks I finally have beautiful strong nails.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that helps my nails stay strong and I have tried many before I found Nail Optimizer.</li>
            <li>I could not get them to come back to health, no matter what kind of treatment I used, or nutrition I tried.  </li>
            <li>I e-mailed the company and a spokesperson said the formula hadn&#x27;t been changed, but performance proves otherwise.</li>
            <li>Not as good as previous product.</li>
            <li>When my nails get brittle or start to split and peel (usually) during the change of seasons), I will just use this product on my nails and it repairs them successfully.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;that really works!</li>
            <li>me not drinking enough H20 so will reserve judgement until I can better assess this &amp;#34;new rendition&amp;#34; of Nail Optimizer.</li>
            <li>Note the dates of the positive reviews....</li>
            <li>Stay tuned and/or try it for yourselves based on my major endorsement of the original formula.</li>
            <li>My nails are VERY strong now and many people ask if I have a French manicure although it&#x27;s simply the nail optimizer plus using a white nail pencil under the tip.  </li>
            <li>(they are real).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some time and the advantages are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The salon has since  closed and I wasn;t able to find it anywhere until I went on Amazon.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I think this really works for nails that need to be strengthened.  </li>
            <li>It really helps strenghten my fingernails.</li>
            <li>many other products and</li>
            <li>Although it is still better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried, I feel something has changed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has  nails that are soft of break easyily.</li>
            <li>This product works better than using regular nail polish, though I still experience thin, peeling, split and breaking nails.  </li>

            <li> Not as good as previous product. Too liquidy and takes too long to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Previous purchase was thicker and dried faster.</li>
            <li> Works well to grow out my nails.</li>
            <li> It came smashed in the package</li>
            <li> Works great, helps nail stay strong and grow</li>
            <li> received product as promised no problems.</li>
            <li> For a year my formerly strong nails had been chipping and splitting.  I could not get them to come back to health, no matter what kind of treatment I used, or nutrition I tried.  A nail technician gave me a sample of Nail Optimizer and suggested I use it every day on my nails.  Amazingly, my nails have all been growing out with the help of this treatment, and out of 10 fingernails, I now have 8 really strong, growing nails.  My two index fingernails are still a little challenged, but they are coming along.  I feel like this nail treatment is somewhat of a miracle !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nail Optimizer for over three years.  I believe they&#x27;ve changed the formula during this time.  It&#x27;s now chipping at the ends of my nails within a couple of days.  This has NEVER happened before.  I am very, very disappointed.  I e-mailed the company and a spokesperson said the formula hadn&#x27;t been changed, but performance proves otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I have great success with it.  I use it as a base coat and a top coat.  When my nails get brittle or start to split and peel (usually) during the change of seasons), I will just use this product on my nails and it repairs them successfully.  I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Used as a base coat under polish or alone, this is the best for peeling or thin nails. I have used it for several years and people ask me all the time if my nails are real or fake (they are real). This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my nails stronger and make my hands look pretty. And my nails don&#x27;t chip</li>
            <li> A great product to help your nails get strong.  Very happy with this also.&lt;br /&gt; Mrs. K</li>
            <li> The best product. My nails have never been stronger or more beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that helps my nails stay strong and I have tried many before I found Nail Optimizer. My nails actually seem to grow faster due to being stronger. I strongly recommend this procuct.</li>
            <li> This product actually works!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that keeps my nails from peeling, splintering, etc. My sisters use it, too.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, awesome product wouldn&#x27;t be without it actually use it every day for awesome nails.  Can be put on all by itself which is the way I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and the advantages are very noticeable.  Use as directed and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought Nail Optimizer at a hair salon and just loved it. The salon has since  closed and I wasn;t able to find it anywhere until I went on Amazon. It makes my nails so nice and hardens them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for having it.  I mentioned it to the hair salon I go to now to see if they would carry it, otherwise I will continue to order through you.  Once again, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Nalda Wheeler</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this strengthener for over a year. My nails appear white on the tips and are very healthy LOVE IT! fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years as a base coat and top coat.  Just great and strengthens nails.  keeps polish on</li>
            <li> My nails have never been as good.  I use it as a base coat and then apply it every day after a manicure.</li>
            <li> My nails have improved.  I think this really works for nails that need to be strengthened.  I would recommend this to anyone who has  nails that are soft of break easyily.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that break a lot.  Using this and I think it is helping.  Supposed to put a coat on everyday and I seem to be failing to work this in.  Hard to find time to NOT USE YOUR HANDS!  It&#x27;s a base and top coat.  I will continue it till the bottle is empty, hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> This product works better than using regular nail polish, though I still experience thin, peeling, split and breaking nails.  I have yet to find another product that works.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that&lt;br /&gt;has problems with splitting and breaking nails. I have&lt;br /&gt;tried many other products and this is the only one&lt;br /&gt;that really works!</li>
            <li> wonderful product.  After several weeks I finally have beautiful strong nails.</li>
            <li> Although it is still better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried, I feel something has changed.  It just doesn&#x27;t strengthen as it did in the past. Note the dates of the positive reviews....they are the oldest reviews. Several friends have also noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. Will order again when necessary.  It really helps strenghten my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Excellent products I saw a difference after seven days</li>
            <li> Think the company &amp;#34;changed hands&amp;#34; and so, not certain, YET,  if the formula is the same...I kind of think, not??? Just found my original formula bottle and applied that to my nails yesterday as my first go-round with the &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t seem to produce the results that the original formula (and my past experience with this superb product) produced. Could be the aftermath of winter weather, dehydrated air and me not drinking enough H20 so will reserve judgement until I can better assess this &amp;#34;new rendition&amp;#34; of Nail Optimizer. BTW, the bottle is different, too. My original formula was in a frosted bottle...not sure if that impacts the efficacy of the product, however. Stay tuned and/or try it for yourselves based on my major endorsement of the original formula.</li>
            <li> I started using Nail Optimizer several years ago after my nails were extremely weak from using gel nails too long.  I followed the directions faithfully until my entire nail grew out, then just used it once weekly.  My nails are VERY strong now and many people ask if I have a French manicure although it&#x27;s simply the nail optimizer plus using a white nail pencil under the tip.  I&#x27;ve given and recommended this polish to several friends who&#x27;ve complimented my nails.  My manicurist has stated each visit how beautiful and strong my once pitiful nails are now.  I use her to shape them, plus I love the hand and arm massage!  Every once in awhile I do get the shellac polish, but as soon as it&#x27;s off, it&#x27;s back to Nail Optimizer. I highly recommend it.</li>
