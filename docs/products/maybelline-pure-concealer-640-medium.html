            <li>\\&quot;Great product.</li>
            <li>It helps to cover up the redness from the acne and does some what of a good in controlling the acne.</li>
            <li>Cant imagine why this has been discontinued, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter pointed out that its good for acne too.</li>
            <li>It works great and blends very well on my beautiful Carmelish-Hispanic-Latino skin color!</li>
            <li>whatever then put your cream makeup over whole face and you&#x27;ve got perfect coverage!</li>
            <li>This is good, because it is easy to just dot on a blemish or spot and tap once and done.</li>
            <li>It dries it up great and is a great coverup at the same time.</li>
            <li>, it was great the first 2-3 times of use</li>
            <li>It is more than a concealer.  </li>
            <li>used this product many times.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok Maybelline</li>
            <li>this little marvel is a perfect \\&quot;pen\\&quot; for age spots......</li>
            <li>It is great for those stray acne spots that pop up, whether one or several.</li>
            <li>I use the medium in the summer &amp; the light in the winter.</li>
            <li>You are able to pinpoint the exact location of where you wish to apply it.</li>
            <li>Went through it veryyy quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was a huge help with reducing my acne.</li>
            <li>But I liked it overall.</li>
            <li>And the color is the right shade for my skin</li>
            <li>Love this concealer because it covers up your spots AND medicates them at the same time.  </li>
            <li>If you were a big fan of the Clinique stick that got discontinues then you will love this.</li>
            <li>Though many will deny it, much of how a person is judged by another is psychologically based on appearance.</li>
            <li>you can really coverup a spot exactly....</li>
            <li>I use tinted moisturizer, &amp; have found this concealer pencil works great for covering up the occasional dark freckle.</li>
            <li>Pure Concealer #640 Medium</li>
            <li>For example, a person with blemishes and pimples will generally not be taken as seriously as a person with perfect skin.</li>
            <li>So, this product really sames me time, money, and space in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>But anyone that wants a blemish concealer that works, this one is it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is a decent concealer, and since I started using this I haven&#x27;t been needing to use my $30 spot treatment.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy like other wands and brands do.</li>
            <li>I love this hard to find product thanks for fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with our.</li>
            <li>if youre self conscious about keeping it in your pocket or on your sink, do like I did.</li>
            <li>This is a blemish concealer, complete with some healing salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>In the line of work I was in, often times first impressions were the difference between success and failure.</li>
            <li>This product really seems to cover up red marks left by acne!</li>
            <li>No endless spreading and so on as I find with messier concealers.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, the product was creamy and made my skin truly radiant like the other reviews have said.</li>
            <li>Love the product but usually very hard to find my color in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>However, in half an hour or so, the covering started to cake and look pretty unnatural around all my blemishes.</li>

            <li> Cannot find in stores anymore.......this little marvel is a perfect \\&quot;pen\\&quot; for age spots......you can really coverup a spot exactly....use it to cover dark spots,  broken veins or whatever then put your cream makeup over whole face and you&#x27;ve got perfect coverage!</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find product thanks for fast delivery. And the color is the right shade for my skin</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is more than a concealer.  It also treats blemishes.  I don&#x27;t have anything to add to this review.  I don&#x27;t know why there are a required # of words.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Great product. Worked for me for a very long time.......7yrs! I think that&#x27;s it for me. My skin is immuned now. But anyone that wants a blemish concealer that works, this one is it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In the line of work I was in, often times first impressions were the difference between success and failure. Though many will deny it, much of how a person is judged by another is psychologically based on appearance. For example, a person with blemishes and pimples will generally not be taken as seriously as a person with perfect skin. A minor detail, but often times details matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product many times. I love it. It works, subdues any pimple and covers it up with no unnatural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, guys .. no shame in using this product. Look your best. if youre self conscious about keeping it in your pocket or on your sink, do like I did. Duct tape it or paint it.</li>
            <li> This is a blemish concealer, complete with some healing salicylic acid. This is good, because it is easy to just dot on a blemish or spot and tap once and done. No endless spreading and so on as I find with messier concealers. This goes where you need it and nowhere else. It is neat to take along, too, and does not come out of your TSA allotment when you travel.</li>
            <li> This product matches my skin well, does not rub off on clothing, and lasts through the day. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to cover up red marks left by acne! It works great and blends very well on my beautiful Carmelish-Hispanic-Latino skin color!</li>
            <li> This is the only concealer I can use that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and it helps with existing blemishes.  I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer because it covers up your spots AND medicates them at the same time.  Usually with concealers I feel the need to re-apply ever few hours. Not with this. Stays put!</li>
            <li> I am a guy and I approve this product. It helps to cover up the redness from the acne and does some what of a good in controlling the acne. Maybe it is just me, but during the day sometimes the salicylic acid in the product stings my face. Again it is probably just my sensitivity towards salicylic acid.  Overall I would buy again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Cant imagine why this has been discontinued, this is a good product.  I use tinted moisturizer, &amp; have found this concealer pencil works great for covering up the occasional dark freckle. My daughter pointed out that its good for acne too. I use the medium in the summer &amp; the light in the winter.</li>
            <li> If you were a big fan of the Clinique stick that got discontinues then you will love this. I can&#x27;t live with our. It hides blemishes with little application while treating it at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy like other wands and brands do. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because sometimes you have to turn the stem a lot to get anything to come out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok Maybelline Pure Concealer #640 Medium, it was great the first 2-3 times of use but then it started to dry up and so I did not use it anymore.  I like the Revlon or Neutrogena mineral concealer, the Laura Mercier concealer or Bobbi Brown concealer.</li>
            <li> wish I could get this in the stores still wonderful product covers and does not show at all. order some</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, the product was creamy and made my skin truly radiant like the other reviews have said. However, in half an hour or so, the covering started to cake and look pretty unnatural around all my blemishes. Maybe its because I wasn&#x27;t applying it to acne scars but to acne pocks that have layers of dead skin and don&#x27;t cover that easily...or maybe the salicylic acid in the product was drying out the skin there, making it a dry/bad spot to apply makeup on. I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was a huge help with reducing my acne. But I liked it overall. Went through it veryyy quickly.</li>
