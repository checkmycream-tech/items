            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it lives up to the &amp;#34;outlast longwear&amp;#34; name, it transfers really easy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture and feels pretty moisturizing.</li>

            <li>I received this product for free to review.  </li>

            <li>I got to test this product for free so of course</li>
            <li>I got this lipstick for free from influenster.com.</li>
            <li>The lipstick went on smooth and wasn&#x27;t cakey or flaky.</li>
            <li>I received this lipstick through Influenster for free, but I believe everything I&#x27;ve said about it.</li>
            <li>This does feel nice and moisturizing, it actually reminds me more of a tinted lip balm than a lipstick.</li>
            <li>seems to be just right!</li>
            <li>I received this free from Influenster to sample, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the color.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, slightly fruity smell and it went on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I had the color plum fury, and it matched very nicely with my dark hair.</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I really like this color Plum Fury that I got free from Influenster in my</li>
            <li>Now I know what my next lipstick purchase will be, and that is my own opinion.  </li>
            <li>It stays on fairly well, not such much after eating though.</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary from the Influenster</li>
            <li>Covergirl got it right with this formula.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and the color is nice and rich but thin enough to be comfortable and not fear I&#x27;m getting it on everything.</li>
            <li>It stayed on well without feeling overly dry or sticky, which is nice if you&#x27;re going to wear it out for the evening.</li>
            <li>It is a nice berry tone with not too much red and not too much purple.  </li>
            <li>I normally like matte lipsticks however this is a very good deep red shade and it lasts through eating and it not too shiny</li>
            <li>Its a little bright for me</li>
            <li>It is a pretty plum/red with a bit of a frosted look.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this going forward and will likely buy more shades when I&#x27;m looking to get more lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color was vibrant and beautiful, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is a bit more red than plum in person on me, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more moisturizing but overall Its a nice lipstick and color.</li>
            <li>It kept my lips pretty moisturized and didn&#x27;t smudge too much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plum, but maybe a little lighter than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I really like the lipstick it really made my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would Not pay this much though on the shipping..</li>
            <li>It truly made me feel ready to #glowthedistance.</li>
            <li>It really does stay put.  </li>
            <li>not a big lipstick person but got to try this for free (these are my opinions)</li>
            <li>and i really do like this.</li>
            <li>On the website and even in the tube, it looks pretty dark, but it goes on as more of a berry color than purple.</li>
            <li>At first look, the shade looked more of a deep red than a plum.  </li>
            <li>The only time I have to reapply is after eating a full meal.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long before I have to reapply.</li>
            <li>I love the slight shimmer and it changes color a bit based on what you wear over/under it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would recommend is lip balm over the top to make it last a little longer, and feel a bit better.</li>
            <li>Even as it slowly fades, the color is phenomenal !</li>
            <li>That being said, I did not receive a color that I would normally wear and wasnt a fan of how it looked on me.</li>
            <li>The quality of the lipstick is outstanding and it stays on for a few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lipstick surprised me, I normally just wear brands from Sephora now that I&#x27;m older because I think the pricier, a lot of the time the quality shoots up.</li>
            <li>so this has become a new staple in my makeup stash.</li>
            <li>Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly this lipstick is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>and I find that many other lip colors start to fade away and only stay on the edges of my lips.</li>
            <li>and it really does last!  </li>
            <li>It is more a mixed between pink and a red and shimmery.</li>
            <li>I needed a new red color!</li>
            <li>However, once I swatched it on the back of my hand, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>In the packaging it looks dark and very sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I found it doesn&#x27;t stay quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to, so my favorite way to wear it is by layering it over a thin layer of matte lip cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear anything other than chapstick</li>

            <li> I really like the lipstick it really made my lips moisturized. The plum color lasted all day. I love the lipstick tube it&#x27;s easy to use and so easy to tuck away in my bag. I tested COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> I love lipstick, I do! I love this PLUM lipstick, it tastes like berries and lasts! Even as it slowly fades, the color is phenomenal ! I am so grateful that I received this as a free sample. I needed a new red color! Now I know what my next lipstick purchase will be, and that is my own opinion.  I would Not pay this much though on the shipping.. just head on over to your local pharmacy!</li>
            <li> My lips usually don&#x27;t like long wearing lip products because they tend to be so drying, but this one is very moisturizing and I loved the color. It&#x27;s not bulletproof either and you will need to reapply every so often, but I would recommend it. Received it for free but opinions my own.</li>
            <li> I received this lipstick free from influenster, but my opinion is my own!  I usually shy away from lipsticks and just use tinted chapsticks because lipstick seems to dry my lips out more and it never lasts.  Covergirl got it right with this formula.  It feels smooth, light and replenishing as it goes and it really does last!  The plum color is good for almost every skin tone!</li>
            <li> This lipstick looks really purple in the tube, but when use it, it is a beautiful, rich mulberry type color. I love the slight shimmer and it changes color a bit based on what you wear over/under it. It stayed on well without feeling overly dry or sticky, which is nice if you&#x27;re going to wear it out for the evening. The only thing I would recommend is lip balm over the top to make it last a little longer, and feel a bit better. It doesn&#x27;t feel bad, you can just tell it&#x27;s a longwear lipstick, if you know what I mean. I received a free sample of this lipstick with my Influencenster VoxBox, but my opinions about the product are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster for free. I don&#x27;t normally wear anything other than chapstick but I gave it a shot. Its a little bright for me but I really liked the color. It didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would think but I tend to lick my lips. I wish it was a little more moisturizing but overall Its a nice lipstick and color. All my opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li> With a beautiful pop of a red-wine color (950), I smeared this stuff on my lips sans makeup and I was pleased.  It was so creamy and had the consistency of a chapstick, not that sticky lipgloss eww. It truly made me feel ready to #glowthedistance. I received all this product for free, but all of these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really like this color Plum Fury that I got free from Influenster in my I Do VoxBox. It was smooth feeling. It stays on fairly well, not such much after eating though. And the color is nothing like what it looks like online. It is more a mixed between pink and a red and shimmery.</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty! The shimmer is nice on days when I feel like having a shimmery lip color rather than matte. It does last rather long, but transfers a bit and does need occasional reapplication. I&#x27;m a lover of lipsticks so this has become a new staple in my makeup stash. I received this lipstick to test from Influenster, and all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick. It is a pretty plum/red with a bit of a frosted look. This does feel nice and moisturizing, it actually reminds me more of a tinted lip balm than a lipstick. I don&#x27;t feel like it lives up to the &amp;#34;outlast longwear&amp;#34; name, it transfers really easy. I received this for free for testing purposes from influenster and covergirl, but these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> So let me start out by saying I tested this COVERGIRL product for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own. That being said, I did not receive a color that I would normally wear and wasnt a fan of how it looked on me. But it is long last and was as advertised! Even after I took the lipstick off the color still stayed behind... all day :)</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review.  I was at first afraid of the color.  In the packaging it looks dark and very sparkly.  However, once I swatched it on the back of my hand, I was surprised.  It was a very smooth formula, no glitter but still had a nice shine.  The color was more lighter than I thought it would be.  It is a nice berry tone with not too much red and not too much purple.  On the lips, it is just beautiful.  This lipstick does have to be reapplied every so often, but it wears nicely.  I think it&#x27;s a great lipstick.  Most longwear lipsticks are uncomfortable because they dry down matte.  This one I wouldn&#x27;t say is longwearing, but it has average staying power.</li>
            <li> This lipstick surprised me, I normally just wear brands from Sephora now that I&#x27;m older because I think the pricier, a lot of the time the quality shoots up. But outlast lipstick has such a moisturizing feel to it AS A LIPSTICK. And once it &amp;#34;dries,&amp;#34; it was hard to get off, which is the goal right? It outlasts everything; eating, brushing your teeth, kissing. It&#x27;s simply amazing. Definitely going to buy different colors that go with my personality and am excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from the Influenster I do voxbox but my opinions are entirely my own and in no way were influenced by them. CG IS DA BEST</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick because the color lasts a long time. The only time I have to reapply is after eating a full meal. It has a pleasant smell and the color is nice and rich but thin enough to be comfortable and not fear I&#x27;m getting it on everything. I would not have picked this color out for myself but I received it free for review purposes from influenster. This does not affect my opinion on the product. My sister saw it and just LOVED it so she had to go get some. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m more of a gloss person, but this went on smooth and clean. pretty good, inexpensive product. thank you influenster for the free sample!</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster to sample, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the color. It&#x27;s plum, but maybe a little lighter than I would have liked. It goes on really smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long before I have to reapply. I think this is more of a lipstick for casual use, not for events or when you need your makeup to last. I had to reapply it quite a few times when I wore it out, and then ended up just switching lipsticks because I just wanted something to stick. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of the CoverGirl Outlast lipstick in Plum Fury.  At first look, the shade looked more of a deep red than a plum.  Still the color is very nice.  I applied earlier in the day and only had to reapply once, even after some drinking.  It really does stay put.  It kept my lips pretty moisturized and didn&#x27;t smudge too much.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the lipstick.  CoverGirl makes quality products.  I received and tested thid COVERGIRL product for free, but the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I normally like matte lipsticks however this is a very good deep red shade and it lasts through eating and it not too shiny seems to be just right! I got to test this product for free so of course this is just my opinion . For sure would recommend</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick for free from influenster.com. I was skeptical to try it at first since I&#x27;m used to wearing lipstick brands such as, YSL, and Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly this lipstick is one of my new favorites. The colors are great. The quality of the lipstick is outstanding and it stays on for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most lipsticks I found this one didnt dry out my lips after wearing it all day long.</li>
            <li> I tried the covergirl outlast longwear lipstick, and I was a fan. As a bride to be I have all kinds of planning and events coming up, in which I liked to look my best for. I had the color plum fury, and it matched very nicely with my dark hair. The lipstick went on smooth and wasn&#x27;t cakey or flaky. The color was vibrant and beautiful, and long lasting. I would recommend this product for anyone out there that is a makeup fan. I will be getting one of these lipsticks for all of my bridesmaids. Thank you to covergirl and influenster for letting me try this product for my 100% honest review, the opinions are all my own. Perfect finishing touch!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a bit more red than plum in person on me, but I still really like it. It has a nice texture and feels pretty moisturizing. I found it doesn&#x27;t stay quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to, so my favorite way to wear it is by layering it over a thin layer of matte lip cream. It stays on a bit better for some reason when I layer it like this and I like the slight shimmer the CoverGirl lipstick adds. If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying every once in a while, it&#x27;s also nice on its own. I received this lipstick through Influenster for free, but I believe everything I&#x27;ve said about it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this lipstick! On the website and even in the tube, it looks pretty dark, but it goes on as more of a berry color than purple. I have pale skin, so this color really complemented my complexion. It has a nice, slightly fruity smell and it went on very smoothly. It also didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing lipstick - it wasn&#x27;t heavy or glossy or sticky. I wore it all day at a house party and only had to re-apply once, after eating and wiping my mouth a lot. It never really came off on the glass I was drinking from, nor did it fade throughout the day just from talking - my mouth always gets dry from talking a lot and I find that many other lip colors start to fade away and only stay on the edges of my lips. I will definitely be using this going forward and will likely buy more shades when I&#x27;m looking to get more lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> not a big lipstick person but got to try this for free (these are my opinions) and i really do like this. I hate buying and wearing lipstick because i always feel like i have to reapply all the time but not with covergirl outlast longwear. I applied once and it stayed on all day, I have always wore Covergirl make up and i now will be adding this to my list of products to always buy.</li>
            <li> I typically do not wear lipstick, so I was not sure if I would like this product or not. Unlike some lipstick, this went on smoothly and it wears great! The color is more bold than I would normally wear, but I love it! I found that it needs infrequent touch-ups. It felt moisturizing and comfortable for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested COVERGIRL&#x27;S lipstick for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
