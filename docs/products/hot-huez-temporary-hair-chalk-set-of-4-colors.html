            <li>Perfect for kids!</li>
            <li>I found it best to spray each chunk of hair I colored as I went.</li>
            <li>Very happy with product.</li>
            <li>For those of you who want to have the best results is that you cannot shampoo for 24 hours ahead of time.</li>
            <li>that was the best part about these.</li>
            <li>I was impressed!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Her best friend was here with brown hair and it didn&#x27;t show up at all for her.</li>
            <li>, They love to copy and ripe off.!!!</li>
            <li>Colors may not be as brilliant as packaging depending on the amount used and the hair color.  </li>

            <li>works great but lightens up when you brush it....</li>
            <li>Color great and cleans up great.</li>
            <li>The chalk itself was a great use according to what color you used.</li>
            <li>The chalk is great, but the sponges ripped out after 2 uses...and hair gets caught in the case.</li>
            <li>It is really great</li>
            <li>Otherwise, GREAT for daughters.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product for my 6-year-old granddaughter.</li>

            <li>It did work great</li>
            <li>They also tend to work best on hair that has been unwashed for a day or two (just like most styling products).</li>

            <li>and she loved them.</li>
            <li>Her parents loved it too as it quelled her desire to dye her hair.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP CHEAP!!!!</li>
            <li>luckily she has blond hair and it looks just great on her and will let her stand out when she starts school!</li>

            <li>Broke the first day!!!!</li>
            <li>It also pulled out quite a bit of hair when she tried to do it on her own.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s four and loves this kind of stuff, and Mom and Dad don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest-</li>
            <li>The chalk comes off very easily from the hair and on to hands, side of face and clothes.</li>
            <li>it was brightly colored (I have light brown hair)</li>
            <li>I am impressed, and so happy with these goofy little gadgets.</li>
            <li>I am impressed, and so happy with these goofy little gadgets.</li>
            <li>the colors are great, but it fell apart the first time my daughter used it.</li>
            <li>very cheaply made 3 of the 4 broke  </li>
            <li>Dont think this is for blond haired girls because my daughter has dark brown hair and its still bright and perfect.</li>
            <li>and I love it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is okay for a one day thing.</li>
            <li>Niece fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Mom and Dad said ok as it is chalk and washes out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Buy the real one at Target or Walmart for 9.99 and be happy ...</li>
            <li>Colors are fun and bright</li>
            <li>the more it fades.</li>
            <li>Just what my grand daughter wanted</li>
            <li>could not even give them to my granddaughter had to take all of product out of boxes out and be creative to give it to them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait another 365 days to get more, so I&#x27;ll have to settle and buy them from the store instead.</li>
            <li>The newer the chalks the better the color.</li>
            <li>They can also safely be used on a dolls hair.</li>

            <li>They can also safely be used on a dolls hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to give it as a gift to anyone else - I would have been embarrased.</li>
            <li>I love this product the colors are very bright and show up really good in dark hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was very excited to get this</li>
            <li>My 12yr old niece loved these, they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pink shows up the best on hair.</li>
            <li>And the hinge for the container snapped easily.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter because of how easy it seemed to be to use.</li>
            <li>They wash out of the hair easily and show up on brown hair.</li>
            <li>Con: It does rub off easily.</li>
            <li>but so easy to put in  </li>
            <li>With that said, even with the hairspray as recommended, it tends to wear off easily and sometimes on her shirts.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy I have dark hair</li>
            <li>Contents however were fine.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best product but for small children, they have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is very fine and bright blonde.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to be creative!</li>
            <li>She is 6 and enjoyed the color, worth it</li>
            <li>Also its cheap</li>
            <li>The insides have cheap sponges that want to stick to your hair.</li>
            <li>Hairspray is something you must need unless you enjoy scrubing couches and chairs for an hour.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t lean your head on any light colored fabric either.  </li>
            <li>If I were a lot younger, I would happily use it myself.</li>
            <li>it is not so light  </li>
            <li>Really!!!</li>
            <li>The Hot Huez themselves were fine, so if you&#x27;re getting these for yourself then go for it!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, in keeping her her interested in this non-damaging alternative, my niece will be able to pick and choose colors that will fit her ever-changing mood and style.  </li>
            <li>Super easy &amp; clean to use.</li>
            <li>Worth the $!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had so much fun using them!</li>
            <li>Right now ive had it for over an hour and its still on!</li>
            <li>and my daughter has curly; it puffed her hair right up!)  </li>
            <li>They show bright in her blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Also is very chalking feeling, and if you brush out your hair with it in it will mostly come out.</li>
            <li>My younger cousin loved these.</li>
            <li>Others have told me how much they love the items.  </li>
            <li>The box was damaged and open when I received it despite a good amount of bubbly cushioning.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors do not work very well if at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage niece as a Christmas gift and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>ran out super quickly</li>
            <li>colors didn&#x27;t look as bold</li>
            <li>This might just work for a blondie, (lucky ducks)</li>
            <li>but they tore up really quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is super tangley-</li>
            <li>The colors faded quickly.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li>Although, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>She also has dark brown hair and it worked great on her hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use an old towel and do it in the bathroom for easier clean up.</li>
            <li>Super fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Does not show up very well and comes out of hair easily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work and broke easily.</li>
            <li>But works best on light blonde hair or dark brown hair not in between colors.</li>
            <li>She is a blonde, the colors look great on her, and it&#x27;s easy enough for her to do herself.  </li>
            <li>If you want to be left with a huge mess and rip your hair off, this is the perfect thing for that!</li>
            <li>It pulled a lot out and the color isn&#x27;t as bright as the picture and didn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy this as much as I wanted too.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors, easy to use, just like eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Buy it its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I order hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and the one thing that requires a signature</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>I love it 13 year old young lady will love them.</li>
            <li>This product is a lot of fun</li>
            <li>She loves doing fun things with her hair.  </li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a lot of fun with my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Fun concept for girls</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friend had fun with them</li>
            <li>I received the product pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>Hot huez is Super for kids...</li>
            <li>, if you do the color will come right out.</li>
            <li>and if you have to brush your hair the color comes right off.</li>
            <li>It lies right there.</li>
            <li>- they weren&#x27;t lined up right</li>
            <li>It shipped from China, in a cheap, flimsy wrapping that was pretty much opened on one end.</li>
            <li>The chalks also slid through their hair easily, leaving pretty little streaks of color that looked adorable!</li>

            <li>My 7-year old loves these, they are easy to use and fun.  </li>
            <li>use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb</li>
            <li>use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb</li>
            <li>They both loved it, I will purchase again down the road.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because my daughter is 5 and used the heck out of this stuff, but it only lasted a few days, and the design isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily it was for my 9 year old, so it&#x27;s fine by her.</li>
            <li>You could barely see the color (pink worked best, others were barely there).</li>
            <li>Worked really well!</li>
            <li>recommend doing your hair in the desired style first and then select the strands to chalk up.</li>
            <li>The first time we used it, after about twenty minutes the product broke, ran out, and flaked everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy it again (at Walmart). :-)</li>
            <li>I even put it on my dog who has a white tip on her tail and neck area, it looks so cute.</li>
            <li>and I was going to have to cut them out of my hair the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I run my local Boys and Girls Club and the kids LOVE dyeing their hair with hair chalks.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>chalks are 100% safe for younger kids.</li>

            <li>chalks are 100% safe for younger kids.</li>
            <li>My mother bought me hot huez to try for summer.</li>
            <li>She was pretty heartbroken.</li>
            <li>Hot hues is over priced in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your super fast sending.</li>
            <li>Great for blonde haired girls but is harder to wash out.</li>
            <li>It did work much better than the generic kind we tried a few years ago.</li>
            <li>but geesh, after waiting that long for delivery, it could have been presented better.</li>
            <li>Wanted something easy that wasn&#x27;t too messy and rinsed out easily</li>
            <li>It is easy to use but is messy and it does rub off on faces and clothing however; it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li>But the other colors looked cute on my girls and washed right out after.</li>
            <li>My daughter has wavy blonde hair, and these things do NOT slide on the hair strands easily.</li>
            <li>Not such an easy slide either without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for the first few days .</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and red.  </li>
            <li>But the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>If you want to really temporarily color your hair, just look up &amp;#34;DIY temporary hair color&amp;#34; on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Very Sticky and Chalky....  must wash hair soon after wearing....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li>This hair chalk showed up very well on my hair, and was much easier to apply then the stick-style hair</li>
            <li>The color did not show up in my daughter&#x27;s hair and her hair is a light strawberry blonde.  </li>
            <li>so it was really affordable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work all that well,&lt;br /&gt;still</li>
            <li>really it should be -1</li>
            <li>I would definitely NOT recommend wearing light clothing with this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this product that much.</li>
            <li>(I have straight</li>
            <li>Really regret putting it in..</li>
            <li>If you are using this you better believe that it&#x27;s going to get everywhere other than your hair, it&#x27;ll get on your hands, clothes, floor, anything and everything.</li>
            <li>Easy enough for my 8 year old to use herself!</li>
            <li>Over all the product served it&#x27;s purpose with most colors but just be very careful when applying to children for the hair pulling</li>
            <li>I used them on my 5 year old niece&#x27;s hair, which is very light brown, and only the green, and purple would show and it would come off after like 20 minutes at most.</li>
            <li>I read elsewhere that spraying them with hairspray helps them stay vibrant for the whole day/night,  Tried this, and it works, and they still wash out.</li>
            <li>We followed the instructions and tips and some of the colors showed ok on dark brown hair, but when I was done the sink and floor of my bathroom had residue all over it.  </li>
            <li>It works with dark brown hair , you can also get at Ross for $4 by the way. :)</li>
            <li>The color does last until bath time when you do it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li>Works well enough, but hardly enough product to do more than one application.</li>
            <li>The color is not as vibrant as the pictures or look as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily while I was at Kroger the local grocery store they had them on display</li>
            <li>the chalks get older</li>
            <li>the chalks get older</li>
            <li>Luckily, it also washes out easily, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>These do not come out as vibrant as the girls hair on the package.  </li>
            <li>and she still has green and blue hair with no sign of washing out, I am trying not to freak out as she had naturally gorgeous platinum hair.</li>
            <li>I was sure that these were going to turn into a tangled mess</li>
            <li>On top of the colors, because I used this for a little girl i was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
            <li>To my surprise, they easily and smoothely slid down my hair- leaving a trail of bright color behind.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and shows up well on her dark hair.  </li>
            <li>My child did have fun with it, I just don&#x27;t think the results are worth all the effort and mess.  </li>
            <li>and I have a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li>The sponges on the opposite side of the chalk come off after the first use.</li>
            <li>Then, when we finally did try them out the sponge came off the first day.</li>
            <li>The sponges feel apart during the first use, the chalk claims to last 3 days</li>
            <li>The rest of the chalks worked ok, they didn&#x27;t leave a straight streak, but rather a dotted line (at least the way my 10-year old girl managed to apply it).</li>
            <li>The blue and pink were very light and barely seen.</li>
            <li>Starting at the top of your head, you press the two sides together and slide them down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super messy and does not work very well</li>
            <li>Used these with my 4 yr old niece.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 yrs old ,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>... bought for my 9 year old, she loves it 😎</li>
            <li>I got this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>that being said, my 8 year old daughter loves it</li>
            <li>Complete junk.</li>
            <li>My 8-year old LOVES this chalk.  </li>
            <li>So I lost one of the four, so much for my daughter&#x27;s birthday present...</li>
            <li>I bought it as a present and thought it would be fun for kids, but it only worked on blond hair.</li>
            <li>Better than what she bought in store, the color lasted for days and went on really well, wasn&#x27;t chalky and dusty like others.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to apply, but even with setting it with hairspray the color does not last long - would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be fun for my daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair</li>
            <li>Very messy so make sure you have a towel around when you apply and don&#x27;t put on back of hair because will transfer on clothing.</li>
            <li>Fun for my 9 year old, but item seemed a little beat-up &amp; not as clean &amp; sturdy as I have seen other similar sets.</li>
            <li>The pink one broke on first use and got powder all over my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>cuz she really wanted it for her bday, well doesnt worth the money, doesnt stay on hair and if you like my daughter have long hair that comes down</li>
            <li>The sponge doesn&#x27;t really even help, it just folds and your only left with the chalk and the plastic.</li>
            <li>Also the ink/ chalk dried out quickly</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the product, but it does waste quickly after about 1 use.</li>
            <li>It dries out your hair, fades within minutes, and is super messy.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun and not too much mess.</li>
            <li>I bought these to have fun with my little sisters.</li>
            <li>I got these for just a little bit of color in my hair for fun.  </li>
            <li>First of all it took me literally 5 whole minutes to get the little chalk container thingies to open and when it finally opened chalk went everywhere.</li>
            <li>last falls apart and disappoints the young lady you might purchase it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The applicators pulled out my hair during application and the color was drab and barely visible.</li>
            <li>If dark hair, you have to put several coats , but it was fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a fun gift for any little girl or teen.</li>
            <li>The pink chalk is the only one that really worked and gave us no problems.</li>
            <li>I was curious to see if the colors would be as vibrant on their hair as they were on mine.</li>
            <li>The boxes were smashed, and one of the Hot Huez boxes had the front plastic film broke out of it, and chalk already on the front of the little compact, and didn&#x27;t have all the colors.  </li>
            <li>It is very cheap, messy, total waste of money.</li>
            <li>After too much fiddling they kinda worked but don&#x27;t show up in dark hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, the side of the box has a picture of a dark-haired girl with eye-popping green highlights.</li>
            <li>In the instructions, it says that one or two presses should be enough, I tried to dye my hair purple, and I ended up using the whole container of hair chalk and my hair was only a slight burgundy.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant even on dark hair tones.</li>
            <li>This little niece really was with that gift.</li>
            <li>It took five days to get to me, the blue chalk was broken and the whole package was covered in blue chalk and made a huge mess to even open it!</li>
            <li>and though a bit messy, it made great funky streaks in my daughters hair for crazy hair day at camp.</li>

            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> For those of you who want to have the best results is that you cannot shampoo for 24 hours ahead of time.</li>

            <li> I was impressed!</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> Her best friend was here with brown hair and it didn&#x27;t show up at all for her.</li>
            <li> , They love to copy and ripe off.!!!</li>
            <li> Colors may not be as brilliant as packaging depending on the amount used and the hair color.  </li>

            <li> Color great and cleans up great.</li>
            <li> The chalk itself was a great use according to what color you used.</li>
            <li> The chalk is great, but the sponges ripped out after 2 uses...and hair gets caught in the case.</li>
            <li> It is really great</li>
            <li> Otherwise, GREAT for daughters.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product for my 6-year-old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Using all four colors, she was happy to have what she termed as &amp;#34;beautiful rainbow hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> Santa&#x27;s elves did a great job making these-</li>

            <li> It did work great</li>
            <li> They also tend to work best on hair that has been unwashed for a day or two (just like most styling products).</li>

            <li> I said- my hair tangles VERY easily!</li>
            <li> The Hair Chalk was not as bright as on tv.</li>
            <li> I have bright blond hair.</li>
            <li> My niece loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> The color was good but the chalk crumbled and fell out of the case.</li>
            <li> Good thing this wasn&#x27;t a gift.</li>
            <li> Junk product  - good advertising.</li>
            <li> She loved it and the colors are really bright.</li>
            <li> My niece loved them.</li>
            <li> and she loved them.</li>
            <li> Her parents loved it too as it quelled her desire to dye her hair.  </li>
            <li> CHEAP CHEAP!!!!</li>
            <li> luckily she has blond hair and it looks just great on her and will let her stand out when she starts school!</li>
            <li> be sure to seal with hair spray - works great</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> Broke the first day!!!!</li>
            <li> It also pulled out quite a bit of hair when she tried to do it on her own.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s four and loves this kind of stuff, and Mom and Dad don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest-</li>
            <li> The chalk comes off very easily from the hair and on to hands, side of face and clothes.</li>
            <li> it was brightly colored (I have light brown hair)</li>
            <li> I am impressed, and so happy with these goofy little gadgets.</li>
            <li> I am impressed, and so happy with these goofy little gadgets.</li>
            <li> the colors are great, but it fell apart the first time my daughter used it.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made 3 of the 4 broke  </li>
            <li> Dont think this is for blond haired girls because my daughter has dark brown hair and its still bright and perfect.</li>
            <li> and I love it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is okay for a one day thing.</li>
            <li> Niece fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Mom and Dad said ok as it is chalk and washes out.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Buy the real one at Target or Walmart for 9.99 and be happy ...</li>
            <li> Colors are fun and bright</li>
            <li> the more it fades.</li>
            <li> Just what my grand daughter wanted</li>
            <li> could not even give them to my granddaughter had to take all of product out of boxes out and be creative to give it to them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait another 365 days to get more, so I&#x27;ll have to settle and buy them from the store instead.</li>
            <li> The newer the chalks the better the color.</li>
            <li> They can also safely be used on a dolls hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to give it as a gift to anyone else - I would have been embarrased.</li>
            <li> I love this product the colors are very bright and show up really good in dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was very excited to get this</li>
            <li> My 12yr old niece loved these, they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pink shows up the best on hair.</li>
            <li> And the hinge for the container snapped easily.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because of how easy it seemed to be to use.</li>
            <li> They wash out of the hair easily and show up on brown hair.</li>
            <li> Con: It does rub off easily.</li>
            <li> but so easy to put in  </li>
            <li> With that said, even with the hairspray as recommended, it tends to wear off easily and sometimes on her shirts.  </li>
            <li> I have been very happy I have dark hair</li>
            <li> Contents however were fine.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best product but for small children, they have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very fine and bright blonde.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to be creative!</li>
            <li> She is 6 and enjoyed the color, worth it</li>
            <li> Also its cheap</li>
            <li> The insides have cheap sponges that want to stick to your hair.</li>
            <li> Hairspray is something you must need unless you enjoy scrubing couches and chairs for an hour.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t lean your head on any light colored fabric either.  </li>
            <li> If I were a lot younger, I would happily use it myself.</li>
            <li> it is not so light  </li>
            <li> Really!!!</li>
            <li> The Hot Huez themselves were fine, so if you&#x27;re getting these for yourself then go for it!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in keeping her her interested in this non-damaging alternative, my niece will be able to pick and choose colors that will fit her ever-changing mood and style.  </li>
            <li> Super easy &amp; clean to use.</li>
            <li> Worth the $!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve had so much fun using them!</li>
            <li> Right now ive had it for over an hour and its still on!</li>
            <li> and my daughter has curly; it puffed her hair right up!)  </li>
            <li> They show bright in her blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Also is very chalking feeling, and if you brush out your hair with it in it will mostly come out.</li>
            <li> My younger cousin loved these.</li>
            <li> Others have told me how much they love the items.  </li>
            <li> The box was damaged and open when I received it despite a good amount of bubbly cushioning.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors do not work very well if at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage niece as a Christmas gift and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> ran out super quickly</li>
            <li> colors didn&#x27;t look as bold</li>
            <li> This might just work for a blondie, (lucky ducks)</li>
            <li> but they tore up really quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair is super tangley-</li>
            <li> The colors faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> Although, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> She also has dark brown hair and it worked great on her hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use an old towel and do it in the bathroom for easier clean up.</li>
            <li> Super fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Does not show up very well and comes out of hair easily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and broke easily.</li>
            <li> But works best on light blonde hair or dark brown hair not in between colors.</li>
            <li> She is a blonde, the colors look great on her, and it&#x27;s easy enough for her to do herself.  </li>
            <li> If you want to be left with a huge mess and rip your hair off, this is the perfect thing for that!</li>
            <li> It pulled a lot out and the color isn&#x27;t as bright as the picture and didn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy this as much as I wanted too.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors, easy to use, just like eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Buy it its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I order hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and the one thing that requires a signature</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li> I love it 13 year old young lady will love them.</li>
            <li> This product is a lot of fun</li>
            <li> She loves doing fun things with her hair.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was a lot of fun with my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Fun concept for girls</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friend had fun with them</li>
            <li> I received the product pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> Hot huez is Super for kids...</li>
            <li> , if you do the color will come right out.</li>
            <li> and if you have to brush your hair the color comes right off.</li>
            <li> It lies right there.</li>
            <li> - they weren&#x27;t lined up right</li>
            <li> It shipped from China, in a cheap, flimsy wrapping that was pretty much opened on one end.</li>
            <li> The chalks also slid through their hair easily, leaving pretty little streaks of color that looked adorable!</li>
            <li> The chalks also slid through their hair easily, leaving pretty little streaks of color that looked adorable!</li>
            <li> My 7-year old loves these, they are easy to use and fun.  </li>
            <li> use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb</li>
            <li> use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb</li>
            <li> They both loved it, I will purchase again down the road.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because my daughter is 5 and used the heck out of this stuff, but it only lasted a few days, and the design isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily it was for my 9 year old, so it&#x27;s fine by her.</li>
            <li> You could barely see the color (pink worked best, others were barely there).</li>
            <li> Worked really well!</li>
            <li> recommend doing your hair in the desired style first and then select the strands to chalk up.</li>
            <li> The first time we used it, after about twenty minutes the product broke, ran out, and flaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy it again (at Walmart). :-)</li>
            <li> I even put it on my dog who has a white tip on her tail and neck area, it looks so cute.</li>
            <li> and I was going to have to cut them out of my hair the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run my local Boys and Girls Club and the kids LOVE dyeing their hair with hair chalks.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> chalks are 100% safe for younger kids.</li>

            <li> My mother bought me hot huez to try for summer.</li>
            <li> She was pretty heartbroken.</li>
            <li> Hot hues is over priced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your super fast sending.</li>
            <li> Great for blonde haired girls but is harder to wash out.</li>
            <li> It did work much better than the generic kind we tried a few years ago.</li>
            <li> but geesh, after waiting that long for delivery, it could have been presented better.</li>
            <li> Wanted something easy that wasn&#x27;t too messy and rinsed out easily</li>
            <li> It is easy to use but is messy and it does rub off on faces and clothing however; it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> But the other colors looked cute on my girls and washed right out after.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy blonde hair, and these things do NOT slide on the hair strands easily.</li>
            <li> Not such an easy slide either without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the first few days .</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and red.  </li>
            <li> But the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> If you want to really temporarily color your hair, just look up &amp;#34;DIY temporary hair color&amp;#34; on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Very Sticky and Chalky....  must wash hair soon after wearing....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk showed up very well on my hair, and was much easier to apply then the stick-style hair</li>
            <li> The color did not show up in my daughter&#x27;s hair and her hair is a light strawberry blonde.  </li>
            <li> so it was really affordable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work all that well,&lt;br /&gt;still</li>
            <li> really it should be -1</li>
            <li> I would definitely NOT recommend wearing light clothing with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product that much.</li>
            <li> (I have straight</li>
            <li> Really regret putting it in..</li>
            <li> If you are using this you better believe that it&#x27;s going to get everywhere other than your hair, it&#x27;ll get on your hands, clothes, floor, anything and everything.</li>
            <li> Easy enough for my 8 year old to use herself!</li>
            <li> Over all the product served it&#x27;s purpose with most colors but just be very careful when applying to children for the hair pulling</li>
            <li> I used them on my 5 year old niece&#x27;s hair, which is very light brown, and only the green, and purple would show and it would come off after like 20 minutes at most.</li>
            <li> I read elsewhere that spraying them with hairspray helps them stay vibrant for the whole day/night,  Tried this, and it works, and they still wash out.</li>
            <li> We followed the instructions and tips and some of the colors showed ok on dark brown hair, but when I was done the sink and floor of my bathroom had residue all over it.  </li>
            <li> It works with dark brown hair , you can also get at Ross for $4 by the way. :)</li>
            <li> The color does last until bath time when you do it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but hardly enough product to do more than one application.</li>
            <li> The color is not as vibrant as the pictures or look as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily while I was at Kroger the local grocery store they had them on display</li>
            <li> the chalks get older</li>
            <li> the chalks get older</li>
            <li> Luckily, it also washes out easily, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> These do not come out as vibrant as the girls hair on the package.  </li>
            <li> and she still has green and blue hair with no sign of washing out, I am trying not to freak out as she had naturally gorgeous platinum hair.</li>
            <li> I was sure that these were going to turn into a tangled mess</li>
            <li> On top of the colors, because I used this for a little girl i was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
            <li> To my surprise, they easily and smoothely slid down my hair- leaving a trail of bright color behind.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and shows up well on her dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My child did have fun with it, I just don&#x27;t think the results are worth all the effort and mess.  </li>
            <li> and I have a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li> The sponges on the opposite side of the chalk come off after the first use.</li>
            <li> Then, when we finally did try them out the sponge came off the first day.</li>
            <li> The sponges feel apart during the first use, the chalk claims to last 3 days</li>
            <li> The rest of the chalks worked ok, they didn&#x27;t leave a straight streak, but rather a dotted line (at least the way my 10-year old girl managed to apply it).</li>
            <li> The blue and pink were very light and barely seen.</li>
            <li> Starting at the top of your head, you press the two sides together and slide them down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super messy and does not work very well</li>
            <li> Used these with my 4 yr old niece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 yrs old ,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ... bought for my 9 year old, she loves it 😎</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> that being said, my 8 year old daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Complete junk.</li>
            <li> My 8-year old LOVES this chalk.  </li>
            <li> So I lost one of the four, so much for my daughter&#x27;s birthday present...</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present and thought it would be fun for kids, but it only worked on blond hair.</li>
            <li> Better than what she bought in store, the color lasted for days and went on really well, wasn&#x27;t chalky and dusty like others.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to apply, but even with setting it with hairspray the color does not last long - would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be fun for my daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair</li>
            <li> Very messy so make sure you have a towel around when you apply and don&#x27;t put on back of hair because will transfer on clothing.</li>
            <li> Fun for my 9 year old, but item seemed a little beat-up &amp; not as clean &amp; sturdy as I have seen other similar sets.</li>
            <li> The pink one broke on first use and got powder all over my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> cuz she really wanted it for her bday, well doesnt worth the money, doesnt stay on hair and if you like my daughter have long hair that comes down</li>
            <li> The sponge doesn&#x27;t really even help, it just folds and your only left with the chalk and the plastic.</li>
            <li> Also the ink/ chalk dried out quickly</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the product, but it does waste quickly after about 1 use.</li>
            <li> It dries out your hair, fades within minutes, and is super messy.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun and not too much mess.</li>
            <li> I bought these to have fun with my little sisters.</li>
            <li> I got these for just a little bit of color in my hair for fun.  </li>
            <li> First of all it took me literally 5 whole minutes to get the little chalk container thingies to open and when it finally opened chalk went everywhere.</li>
            <li> last falls apart and disappoints the young lady you might purchase it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The applicators pulled out my hair during application and the color was drab and barely visible.</li>
            <li> If dark hair, you have to put several coats , but it was fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a fun gift for any little girl or teen.</li>
            <li> The pink chalk is the only one that really worked and gave us no problems.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if the colors would be as vibrant on their hair as they were on mine.</li>
            <li> The boxes were smashed, and one of the Hot Huez boxes had the front plastic film broke out of it, and chalk already on the front of the little compact, and didn&#x27;t have all the colors.  </li>
            <li> It is very cheap, messy, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After too much fiddling they kinda worked but don&#x27;t show up in dark hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, the side of the box has a picture of a dark-haired girl with eye-popping green highlights.</li>
            <li> In the instructions, it says that one or two presses should be enough, I tried to dye my hair purple, and I ended up using the whole container of hair chalk and my hair was only a slight burgundy.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant even on dark hair tones.</li>
            <li> This little niece really was with that gift.</li>
            <li> It took five days to get to me, the blue chalk was broken and the whole package was covered in blue chalk and made a huge mess to even open it!</li>
            <li> and though a bit messy, it made great funky streaks in my daughters hair for crazy hair day at camp.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to clean it out of the grout.</li>
            <li> Lime green, blue, purple, and hot pink.</li>
            <li> product is NOT nearly as vibrant as pictures indicate - barely shows up on brunettes or redheads.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long at all either.</li>
            <li> I definately am not worried about exchanging it - I can only imagine how long that would take.</li>
            <li> key is to spray it with hairspray and let it dry before brushing</li>
            <li> The chalk breaks up easily which makes it difficult to put on the hair, leaving chunks of chalk on the hair.</li>
            <li> Works nicely on my black hair but you can only use a few times and it kinda hurts but colors are very vibrant and works well</li>
            <li> They were ok for my 8 yr old, but were a little disappointing in the resuls.</li>
            <li> Product okay for Halloween use or \\&quot;crazy hair</li>
            <li> You can barely see the color because her hair is too dark.</li>
            <li> Third of all this chalk stuff does not wash out easily,I had to scrub my hands with the rough side of the sponge and the chalk is still all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use on wet hair the chalk does not last as long.</li>
            <li> A broken Hot Huez is something extra to handle.</li>
            <li> This is the second kind my daughter had tried and remains disappointed.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is healthier, because unlike it was in high school, it&#x27;s no longer subject to regular harsh dyes and colors.</li>
            <li> especially the pink!</li>
            <li> I just glued them back in other than that</li>
            <li> I agree with all other critical reviews.</li>
            <li> They also dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel gross, and it gets every where, however ALL the colors work on dark hair.</li>
            <li> Second of all this chalk does not show up on dark hair at all.</li>
            <li> I selected several strands of her hair at a time beginning at the root, pulled the chalk  down to the ends.</li>
            <li> You should by it, but if you are dark haired pink may be the one that only appears.</li>
            <li> The color is not vibrant whatsoever and it takes forever to get the color on your hair,when i got the color on my hair every time I would touch my hair chalk would get all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Only got to use it once and made a mess with the crumbled chalk everywhere.</li>
            <li> These are not a good buy at all do not waste your money, my daughter received them and they are like little clam shells as you can see on the box and they are not well made at all, you barely get any color out of them, she used them once</li>
            <li> I ordered them early Dec. and didn&#x27;t get until LATE Jan.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for Xmas, they are not very well put together and are made of cheep plastic.</li>
            <li> and my wife opened them and the boxes were crushed and torn up</li>
            <li> Never use them on wet hair- as it will age the chalks faster.</li>
            <li> Never use them on wet hair- as it will age the chalks faster.</li>
            <li> not what was expected  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible,just downright terrible,worst money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> the first time useing them , you had to squeeze hard to get color on your hair and the chalk is in a little metal tray and it pulled out quite a few hairs in the process  ,</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, but this product made my hair so dry and was a complete mess!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get tons of hairspray on all the other that is not colored yet.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> The container opens up and there is a sponge on one side, and the chalk on the other.</li>
            <li> This is a little messy for the younger girls who want to play with it.</li>
            <li> Also, when she&#x27;d use the green and blue chalk, the little sponge would curl up and pull her hair out.</li>
            <li> so i had to be very careful when using it.</li>
            <li> These are hard to open and they exploded everywhere.</li>
            <li> Hard to close especially after use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $7.15.</li>
            <li> It does not work well with dark hair.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is not worth you money and would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that 2 of the chalk holders fell out.</li>
            <li> Ps we all have dark hair.</li>
            <li> It says it can be used on dark hair as well, but don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the biggest wastes of money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will spray it with hairspray to slow down the fading and keep the chalk in place.  </li>
            <li> Hot Huez is very messy and it has a very disgusting and cheap texture.</li>
            <li> and they have dark brown to jet black hair.</li>
            <li> Application was difficult on long hair and color was barely visible in dark blond hair.</li>
            <li> and I get a package that came in beat up and wrapped with a black plastic bag and tape.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and the color</li>
            <li> but after half an hour or so the color was gone</li>
            <li> that after one application the product in one compact if half gone.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them and they were wrapped in a black garbage bag with some tape wrapped around it</li>
            <li> I cannot use curlers, krimpers, hair ties, or even bobby pins without an inevitbly tangled mess.</li>
            <li> When I took the box out, the plastic container slipped out and one of the compacts dropped on the floor making a mess all over the kitchen floor.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last very long but it works on my hair and I have dirty blonde hair usually in the store</li>
            <li> The sponges all broke in half after we used it just few times .</li>
            <li> Even with the recommendations in the other reviews, very little color laid on her blond hair.</li>
            <li> One of the hot huez was broken, and they are either old or have been in bad storage conditions because they do not work, the chalk just crumbles.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my little girl.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT work on dark hair!</li>
            <li> Some of the &amp;#34;colors&amp;#34; containers were a little messed up -</li>
            <li> The clamp like pulls on your hair so tight that you lose quite of few strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I even tried them in my hair and they still didn&#x27;t work what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste yuour time.</li>
            <li> it was so messy i dont plan 2</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble rinsing the color from her hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> Each of the chalks are in a round container.</li>
            <li> FEW</li>
            <li> FEW</li>
            <li> The only color that wasn&#x27;t broken was green.</li>
            <li> We were very excited to try Hot Huez, to get crazy for summer but were very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dark, it&#x27;s quite hard to get the colors to show up.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have was that the box was torn and broken.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a issue with the seller or product itself, Ive seen the product at the store and it looked like it was printed at the factory.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is woth a dollar or two, but definitely not $7 or more.</li>
            <li> Hardly any chalk in the pack and</li>
            <li> Color hardly shows.</li>
            <li> but you have to squeeze so hard to get any color to transfer that it was pulling and breaking her hair off.</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 weeks late and box was so damaged looked like a dog used it as a chew toy.</li>
            <li> and later when she had crazy hair day at school.</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed in this item reason the box came damaged and when I opened it only to find 2 blue colours of chalk 1 green and 1 pink NO purple as expected by picture on box and the worst part was when I try to use it</li>
            <li> Super Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Not good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Sadly the compacts of chalk are small and still require pulling my daughters hair to apply it.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product because the pressing sponge breaks on.the first try and goes.in your hair.</li>
            <li> To get any color to show, we had to pass through 7 or 8 times and it was a very dull color even then.</li>
            <li> Little disappointing.</li>
            <li> and they performed so poorly that we just gave them away.</li>
            <li> Not happy with wasting money like this.</li>
            <li> The pieces were broken when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Was completely broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is</li>
            <li> One of the worse purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Although there have been cases were the packaging is busted and product is broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy...</li>
            <li> Not great at all.</li>
            <li> It was a terrible product and a total waste of time, effort, and money!</li>
            <li> the box was copied and its a fake.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>

            <li> Needless to say-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The sponges on the opposite side of the chalk come off after the first use. One color chalk came out of the disk. Not worth the $7.15.</li>
            <li> It works great I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work on my braids but it dud</li>
            <li> Used these with my 4 yr old niece. Super easy &amp; clean to use. Great color. Comes off if you don&#x27;t folloe directions.</li>
            <li> These are not a good buy at all do not waste your money, my daughter received them and they are like little clam shells as you can see on the box and they are not well made at all, you barely get any color out of them, she used them once and they performed so poorly that we just gave them away. Super Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My niece loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> got it for my daughter cuz she really wanted it for her bday, well doesnt worth the money, doesnt stay on hair and if you like my daughter have long hair that comes down your back then worry about getting chalk all over your clothes. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but hardly enough product to do more than one application. Not good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I give it one star.  It took five days to get to me, the blue chalk was broken and the whole package was covered in blue chalk and made a huge mess to even open it! My daughters hair is very fine and bright blonde. All the sponges fell out as soon as I tried to glide it through her hair. I would just go with a different brand.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all and they broke. Worst purchase! But the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Wanted something easy that wasn&#x27;t too messy and rinsed out easily I have been very happy I have dark hair and it shows up great can&#x27;t use it on very short hair though brother was bummed</li>
            <li> The color was good but the chalk crumbled and fell out of the case. Only got to use it once and made a mess with the crumbled chalk everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this product the colors are very bright and show up really good in dark hair.  I received the product pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my step-daughter and niece, you would have thought I bought them diamonds. They both loved it, I will purchase again down the road.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s package arrived crumpled and falling apart. I was almost concerned it might have been used! Then, when we finally did try them out the sponge came off the first day.</li>
            <li> Application was difficult on long hair and color was barely visible in dark blond hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, i received item and the box was smashed, when i opened one chalk the whole thing just feel out. When using the others the sponges all fell off in one stroke through my daughters hair. Not happy with wasting money like this.</li>
            <li> Seller Gravity-US is in China and it will take forever to ship out from the date you order it. I ordered this on Nov 4th 2013 and it did not ship out till Dec 23rd 2013. I finally received it 1/13/2014. I paid $4.13 in shipping and handling and I get a package that came in beat up and wrapped with a black plastic bag and tape. When I opened it one of the colors popped out of the plastic holder. Good thing this wasn&#x27;t a gift. I would be embarrassed to give this to someone. Not sure if this is a issue with the seller or product itself, Ive seen the product at the store and it looked like it was printed at the factory. The one I got from the seller it looked like the box was copied and its a fake.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very excited to get this and it doesn&#x27;t even work on her hair. You can barely see the color because her hair is too dark.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all. I bought them for my little girl. I even tried them in my hair and they still didn&#x27;t work what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 yrs old ,&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and I love it,&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that the color comes off&lt;br /&gt;on everything, but besides that I still use it.&lt;br /&gt;  Lydia A Perales</li>
            <li> Product okay for Halloween use or \\&quot;crazy hair days\\&quot; school activities.  Sponges in container pull hair out and come out after one use.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and red.  It pulled a lot out and the color isn&#x27;t as bright as the picture and didn&#x27;t last the whole day.  She is 6 and enjoyed the color, worth it I guess but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> The sponges feel apart during the first use, the chalk claims to last 3 days and it last not even 3 hours (even when I followed instructions and finished it with hair spray). I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to apply, but even with setting it with hairspray the color does not last long - would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Chalk fell out of the comb.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Delivery was on time and nothing was damaged. The colors are as pictured. They show bright in her blonde hair. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> works great but lightens up when you brush it.... key is to spray it with hairspray and let it dry before brushing... bought for my 9 year old, she loves it 😎</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter. We were disappointed with the product and the results. It was a little difficult to apply. Even when holding the top of the strand of hair, it was difficult to pull it through. It does not work well with dark hair. You could barely see the color (pink worked best, others were barely there). The chalk comes off very easily from the hair and on to hands, side of face and clothes. On the positive side, it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have black hair and the color is so bright! especially the pink! I dont get why people are saying it doesnt work cause it does! U just have to follow the instructions and its great! Right now ive had it for over an hour and its still on! Great product! I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to be creative!</li>
            <li> I think this is okay for a one day thing. Do NOT sleep with this in your hair! It will get all over your pillow. It comes off on your clothes (but doesn&#x27;t stain them) Also is very chalking feeling, and if you brush out your hair with it in it will mostly come out. It makes your hair feel gross, and it gets every where, however ALL the colors work on dark hair.</li>
            <li> Fell apart, all the chalk fell out of the container.</li>
            <li> It works on all hair colors! I used it at my daughter&#x27;s slumber party and the girls ( ten year olds) had a blast with it. It is easy to use but is messy and it does rub off on faces and clothing however; it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> This little niece really was with that gift.</li>
            <li> The pink one broke on first use and got powder all over my bathroom floor. It was very hard to clean it out of the grout. But the other colors looked cute on my girls and washed right out after.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for 3 granddaughters for birthdays. It shipped from China, in a cheap, flimsy wrapping that was pretty much opened on one end. The boxes were smashed, and one of the Hot Huez boxes had the front plastic film broke out of it, and chalk already on the front of the little compact, and didn&#x27;t have all the colors.  It had two pinks and no blue.  I suspect it was a used item, perhaps made up of returns? I gave this order 1 star because there was nothing &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; to choose. That should tell you how happy I am! Don&#x27;t order from these people!</li>
            <li> This is one of the biggest wastes of money I&#x27;ve ever spent. If you are using this you better believe that it&#x27;s going to get everywhere other than your hair, it&#x27;ll get on your hands, clothes, floor, anything and everything. Not to mention it also pulls the crap out of your hair, every time I clamp and pull it, hair comes with it. The sponge doesn&#x27;t really even help, it just folds and your only left with the chalk and the plastic. If you want to be left with a huge mess and rip your hair off, this is the perfect thing for that! If you want to really temporarily color your hair, just look up &amp;#34;DIY temporary hair color&amp;#34; on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I would say 5 stars but it does pull hair a tiny bit.  And the hinge for the container snapped easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. The pieces were broken when it was delivered. Although, very fast shipping! I didn&#x27;t enjoy this as much as I wanted too. This was a gift.</li>
            <li> I received these from my aunt as a present and as soon I as I put it on I relised  it was brightly colored (I have light brown hair) but after half an hour or so the color was gone I also relised it had rubbed off on my clothes which doesn&#x27;t come out by the way and I put them on for a party and the color in the tube thing ran out super quickly I would say this product is not worth you money and would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Junk product  - good advertising. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last falls apart and disappoints the young lady you might purchase it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not realize was coming from china. Arrived 2 weeks late and box was so damaged looked like a dog used it as a chew toy. Everything was just busted up into pieces just threw in garbage. Never again!!!!! Only reason gave a star is because you have to.</li>
            <li> Niece fell in love with it.  Mom and Dad said ok as it is chalk and washes out. Colors may not be as brilliant as packaging depending on the amount used and the hair color.  I would do business with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors, easy to use, just like eyeshadow. Super fun to play with. My only complaint was that 2 of the chalk holders fell out. I just glued them back in other than that I think it&#x27;s a fun gift for any little girl or teen.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old. She loved it and the colors are really bright. Dont think this is for blond haired girls because my daughter has dark brown hair and its still bright and perfect. I love it. Buy it its worth the money. Also its cheap</li>
            <li> Very Sticky and Chalky....  must wash hair soon after wearing.... that being said, my 8 year old daughter loves it</li>
            <li> It did work much better than the generic kind we tried a few years ago. The only problem is that it gets all over your hands and anything else that it comes in contact with as well. It also pulled out quite a bit of hair when she tried to do it on her own.</li>
            <li> Was completely broken when I got it. Hardly any chalk in the pack and the sponge fell off, wasn&#x27;t even attached when I got it.</li>
            <li> Its is a really bad fake item and from CHINA  ....it falls apart it does not chalk the hair , worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made . Buy the real one at Target or Walmart for 9.99 and be happy ... I HEAT THIS CHINESE PEOPLE , They love to copy and ripe off.!!!</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed in this item reason the box came damaged and when I opened it only to find 2 blue colours of chalk 1 green and 1 pink NO purple as expected by picture on box and the worst part was when I try to use it the sponge came off from the pod. Extremely disappointed in this item</li>
            <li> Stays in great when sealed w hairspray! Easy enough for my 8 year old to use herself! Perfect for kids!</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy blonde hair, and these things do NOT slide on the hair strands easily. The insides have cheap sponges that want to stick to your hair. The color is not as vibrant as the pictures or look as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily it was for my 9 year old, so it&#x27;s fine by her. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this is you are over 9 though.</li>
            <li> No the product did not even work on my hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well and was in the trash almost as soon as it was opened -- disappointing holiday gift -- don&#x27;t waste yuour time.</li>
            <li> Does not show up very well and comes out of hair easily.</li>
            <li> the colors are great, but it fell apart the first time my daughter used it. the padding does not stay attached and it is needed to apply the color. I will stick with cool-aid.</li>
            <li> I bought these to have fun with my little sisters. The clamp like pulls on your hair so tight that you lose quite of few strands of hair. Also the ink/ chalk dried out quickly so the color was no longer even working. Ps we all have dark hair. Color hardly shows.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because of how easy it seemed to be to use. Sadly the compacts of chalk are small and still require pulling my daughters hair to apply it. What&#x27;s worse is that after one application the product in one compact if half gone. I&#x27;ve switched to another brand of hair chalk and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li> They do not work as advertised.  After too much fiddling they kinda worked but don&#x27;t show up in dark hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because my daughter is 5 and used the heck out of this stuff, but it only lasted a few days, and the design isn&#x27;t the best. It pulled on her hair and the sponges kept coming out, which would get chalk all over the floor. I do suggest that you seal it in with the hairspray like it says in the instructions. The color does last until bath time when you do it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad. I would probably buy hair chalk in the future; just maybe a different brand.</li>
            <li> Got these for my Granddaughter as a play gift she&#x27;s four and loves this kind of stuff, and Mom and Dad don&#x27;t mind. The colors are nice but she is a blonde and the colors didn&#x27;t want to wash out. They also dry out the hair. Will not purchase these again. Received package before appointed time but packages were damaged. Contents however were fine.</li>
            <li> My younger cousin loved these. They can tug on the hair though, so beware of usage. She also has dark brown hair and it worked great on her hair.</li>
            <li> Worked really well! My niece loved them. Better than what she bought in store, the color lasted for days and went on really well, wasn&#x27;t chalky and dusty like others.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present and thought it would be fun for kids, but it only worked on blond hair. It says it can be used on dark hair as well, but don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Got for my niece and she loved them. Color great and cleans up great. If dark hair, you have to put several coats , but it was fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all.  Complete junk.</li>
            <li> the only reason that i did not rate this a one, is because i got this for my cousin. she wanted to try it on me and it wouldn&#x27;t, so it does not work on any color of hair like it says. luckily she has blond hair and it looks just great on her and will let her stand out when she starts school!</li>
            <li> Works nicely on my black hair but you can only use a few times and it kinda hurts but colors are very vibrant and works well</li>
            <li> This hair chalk showed up very well on my hair, and was much easier to apply then the stick-style hair chalk.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing your hair in the desired style first and then select the strands to chalk up. Once you get the color in-hairspray it immediately. I found it best to spray each chunk of hair I colored as I went. So you can slip a piece of paper under it before you spray so you don&#x27;t get tons of hairspray on all the other that is not colored yet. Then do not comb or brush your hair, if you do the color will come right out. For what it is, it worked very well to highlight blue and green streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this item. I thought this would be fun for my daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair but you have to squeeze so hard to get any color to transfer that it was pulling and breaking her hair off. She ended up using it on her dolls and barbies. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love these!  They do wash out.  I read elsewhere that spraying them with hairspray helps them stay vibrant for the whole day/night,  Tried this, and it works, and they still wash out.</li>
            <li> The color did not show up in my daughter&#x27;s hair and her hair is a light strawberry blonde.  We threw them out.</li>
            <li> Hot huez is Super for kids... Color Does fades out by end of day. Do wish color was brighter lasting. Worth the $!</li>
            <li> it was so messy i dont plan 2 use it anymore Do NOT by this product it stinks i hate it</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the product, but it does waste quickly after about 1 use. I will purchase again because she loves it, but I feel it should last a bit longer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have brown hair.  Doesn&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li> Broke the first day!!!! Garbage</li>
            <li> The chalk itself was a great use according to what color you used. I used them on my 5 year old niece&#x27;s hair, which is very light brown, and only the green, and purple would show and it would come off after like 20 minutes at most. The blue and pink were very light and barely seen. On top of the colors, because I used this for a little girl i was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t pull hair but it did, i even tried it on my hair to see how it work and it pulled hair a lot so i had to be very careful when using it. Over all the product served it&#x27;s purpose with most colors but just be very careful when applying to children for the hair pulling</li>
            <li> Colors are fun and bright only thing is it clumps on hair and if you have to brush your hair the color comes right off. Very messy so make sure you have a towel around when you apply and don&#x27;t put on back of hair because will transfer on clothing.</li>
            <li> My 7-year old loves these, they are easy to use and fun.  They wash out of the hair easily and show up on brown hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the first few days . The sponges all broke in half after we used it just few times . Disappointing ! And it pulls hair out every time you do it .</li>
            <li> Its is a really bad item, it falls apart it does not chalk the hair worst purchae I&#x27;ve ever made</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a 0 out of five. It was a terrible product and a total waste of time, effort, and money! My daughter has brown hair and it didn&#x27;t show up at all. To get any color to show, we had to pass through 7 or 8 times and it was a very dull color even then. It got everywhere. On her clothes, on her skin, in our tub, and on our VERY expensive marble sink. We tried to wash it but it wouldn&#x27;t come out. The first time we used it, after about twenty minutes the product broke, ran out, and flaked everywhere. And also even after spraying with hair spray it faded and was gone after an hour or two. Not to mention, it pulls hair and hurts like crazy! We were very excited to try Hot Huez, to get crazy for summer but were very disappointed. Do NOT buy this product!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last very long but it works on my hair and I have dirty blonde hair usually in the store it&#x27;s 15 dollars so it was really affordable.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made 3 of the 4 broke  the first time useing them , you had to squeeze hard to get color on your hair and the chalk is in a little metal tray and it pulled out quite a few hairs in the process  ,</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Only complaint I have was that the box was torn and broken. Little disappointing. This was a gift for my niece.</li>
            <li> For some reason that I do not understand this 5 dollar item required a signature for the postal service to leave it here. Really!!! I order hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and the one thing that requires a signature is hair chalk. The options ended up being making a trip to the post office or letting it go back. I let it go back. Luckily while I was at Kroger the local grocery store they had them on display and I bought one there.</li>
            <li> Super messy and does not work very well</li>
            <li> it was all damaged and it did not work at all</li>
            <li> The chalk is great, but the sponges ripped out after 2 uses...and hair gets caught in the case. I&#x27;ve had to improvize on it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work all that well,&lt;br /&gt;still got it all over my fingers,&lt;br /&gt;and colors didn&#x27;t look as bold&lt;br /&gt;as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Chalk dust on everything, but it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li> Thanks for your super fast sending. I love it 13 year old young lady will love them.Wll buy from again.</li>
            <li> The package was basically made of a trash bag wrapped in tape. The package was also damaged. One of the hot huez was broken, and they are either old or have been in bad storage conditions because they do not work, the chalk just crumbles. One of the worse purchases I&#x27;ve made. I only gave it 1 star because I had to.....really it should be -1 star. I know it wasn&#x27;t actually purchased from Amazon, all of the return info is in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant even on dark hair tones.</li>
            <li> The Hair Chalk was not as bright as on tv. For those of you who want to have the best results is that you cannot shampoo for 24 hours ahead of time. Also, if you use on wet hair the chalk does not last as long. Hairspray is something you must need unless you enjoy scrubing couches and chairs for an hour. It is really great but the longer you leave it in, the more it fades. Pink shows up the best on hair. You should by it, but if you are dark haired pink may be the one that only appears. Great for blonde haired girls but is harder to wash out. Although there have been cases were the packaging is busted and product is broken. If you are feeling uneasy about all these cautions I will go with the store brand. A broken Hot Huez is something extra to handle. Otherwise, GREAT for daughters.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon (found it at Walmart). I think it is a great product for my 6-year-old granddaughter. We used it to compliment her Halloween costume (She was a fairy princess) and later when she had crazy hair day at school. It is easy to apply and shows up well on her dark hair.  Her hair is long and thick. I selected several strands of her hair at a time beginning at the root, pulled the chalk  down to the ends. Using all four colors, she was happy to have what she termed as &amp;#34;beautiful rainbow hair&amp;#34;. Con: It does rub off easily. She will likely have a rainbow colored forehead by the end of the day. Next time, I will spray it with hairspray to slow down the fading and keep the chalk in place.  I would definitely NOT recommend wearing light clothing with this product. Don&#x27;t lean your head on any light colored fabric either.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble rinsing the color from her hair afterwards. This product is a lot of fun and I will definitely buy it again (at Walmart). :-) If I were a lot younger, I would happily use it myself.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money! First of all, the side of the box has a picture of a dark-haired girl with eye-popping green highlights. It lies right there. It DOES NOT work on dark hair! In the instructions, it says that one or two presses should be enough, I tried to dye my hair purple, and I ended up using the whole container of hair chalk and my hair was only a slight burgundy. This might just work for a blondie, (lucky ducks) but if you have darker hair, don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Instructions were not included.</li>
            <li> I saw this on TV and thought I&#x27;d give it a try....worst mistake ever!!! I have really thick hair, but this product made my hair so dry and was a complete mess! It stained my carpet and my skin! I had to shampoo 4 times to get it out. Not happy...</li>
            <li> Great idea but they tore up really quickly.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for Xmas, they are not very well put together and are made of cheep plastic. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> Just what my grand daughter wanted</li>
            <li> Got these for my granddaughter.  She loves doing fun things with her hair.  And these are not permanent.  They&#x27;ll wash out - that was the best part about these.</li>
            <li> Bought for Granddaughters for Easter.  Others have told me how much they love the items.  I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> do not buy from this supplier the product was purchased dec 6 2013 received it on dec 3. I bought 2 of them and they were wrapped in a black garbage bag with some tape wrapped around it and my wife opened them and the boxes were crushed and torn up could not even give them to my granddaughter had to take all of product out of boxes out and be creative to give it to them. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is not so light  but so easy to put in  i am so getting one !!! you should to</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!!!! This is a terrible product because the pressing sponge breaks on.the first try and goes.in your hair. Also the coloring is crumy and color gets all.over your clothes.  Do not buy this product</li>
            <li> I got these for just a little bit of color in my hair for fun.  My boys actually like them as well.  I even put it on my dog who has a white tip on her tail and neck area, it looks so cute.</li>
            <li> Pulls your hair out during usage as well as staining. It didn&#x27;t describe itself well like the actual product itself. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the product, it&#x27;s on time delivery and recipient of this gift was very pleased as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and sort of obsessed with dying my hair. The problem? I have a career that isn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;pro purple hair&#x27;, so instead I use hair chalks. I can color my hair on my days off- and wash it off before my boss ever even knows it happens. Plus- I can change up the color as often as I want. There are no chemicals involved. And my hair is healthier, because unlike it was in high school, it&#x27;s no longer subject to regular harsh dyes and colors. Hooray! I&#x27;ve used pastel chalks for about the last year, and this Christmas Santa dropped these off under my tree. I&#x27;ll be honest- I was a bit skeptical at first. My hair is super tangley- and curly- and I have a very sensitive head. I was sure that these were going to turn into a tangled mess and I was going to have to cut them out of my hair the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each package comes with four different chalks. Lime green, blue, purple, and hot pink. Each of the chalks are in a round container. The container opens up and there is a sponge on one side, and the chalk on the other. You take a strip of your hair, place the open container, and press the chalk side to the outer part of your head and the sponge side to the side closest to your face. Starting at the top of your head, you press the two sides together and slide them down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said- my hair tangles VERY easily! I cannot use curlers, krimpers, hair ties, or even bobby pins without an inevitbly tangled mess. So I was sure that these would fail epically and create a rat&#x27;s nest of my hair in a second. To my surprise, they easily and smoothely slid down my hair- leaving a trail of bright color behind. I was impressed! And I&#x27;ve had so much fun using them! I run my local Boys and Girls Club and the kids LOVE dyeing their hair with hair chalks. All of my kids are Yup&#x27;ik Eskimo (Alaskan Native) and they have dark brown to jet black hair. I have bright blond hair. I was curious to see if the colors would be as vibrant on their hair as they were on mine. To my surprise they were! We also have two African American girls who attend my BGC, and have textured hair. The chalks also slid through their hair easily, leaving pretty little streaks of color that looked adorable! Needless to say- I am impressed, and so happy with these goofy little gadgets. Will definitely be buying more. Santa&#x27;s elves did a great job making these- I can&#x27;t wait another 365 days to get more, so I&#x27;ll have to settle and buy them from the store instead. They are definitely worth the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;-As the chalks get older they will be begin to get &#x27;crumbly&#x27;. Never use them on wet hair- as it will age the chalks faster. The newer the chalks the better the color. So I suggest using them within 2 to 3 months of buying them.&lt;br /&gt;-Hairspray your hair after you&#x27;ve colored, this will keep the color from getting on your clothes and hands. It will rub off without the hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;-Hair chalks are 100% safe for younger kids. Kids ages 5 and up can use them by themselves! They can also safely be used on a dolls hair. If you are going to wash dolls hair- use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb your hair prior to using the colors. They also tend to work best on hair that has been unwashed for a day or two (just like most styling products). To prevent your hair from over-drying out from the chalk, don&#x27;t shampoo it for 24 hours ahead of time.ey were on mine. To my surprise they were!

If you are going to wash dolls hair- use a wet rag with mild shampoo and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Comb your hair prior to using the colors. They also tend to work best on hair that has been unwashed for a day or two (just like most styling products). To prevent your hair from over-drying out from the chalk, don&#x27;t shampoo it for 24 hours ahead of time.</li>
            <li> no it did not do what I thought and as I tried to use them on the kids&#x27; hair they fell apart and the color part came out of holder in a million pieces! Total waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> These are hard to open and they exploded everywhere. I bought three packs. One for each of my children and all of them did this. I would save yourself a lot of cleaning time but just avoiding this product</li>
            <li> My kids like to have the colors put in their hair. The chalk breaks up easily which makes it difficult to put on the hair, leaving chunks of chalk on the hair. It doesn&#x27;t last long at all either. If the child runs, jumps, brushes against something, the chalk falls out. I have even tried using gel and hairspray to seal it in. This isn&#x27;t the best product but for small children, they have enjoyed it. I would probably look for a cream temporary hair color next time, hoping it will last until we decide to wash it out.</li>
            <li> A very disappointing purchase.  The applicators pulled out my hair during application and the color was drab and barely visible.</li>
            <li> My 8-year old LOVES this chalk.  She is a blonde, the colors look great on her, and it&#x27;s easy enough for her to do herself.  With that said, even with the hairspray as recommended, it tends to wear off easily and sometimes on her shirts.  Luckily, it also washes out easily, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> this was a lot of fun with my granddaughter.  She thought she was a movie star after using.  Lots of fun and not too much mess.</li>
            <li> My 12yr old niece loved these, they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this it the chalk is powdery and falls off your hair and ruined one of my white shirts. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WHITE CLOTHING WHILE USING HTIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product that much. I ordered it for a gift for myself and someone else ended up getting it for me too. I did try it, it works. The contents of the one I ordered from here took FOREVER to get to me. I ordered them early Dec. and didn&#x27;t get until LATE Jan. When I did recieve it, from China, the box was DESTROYED. I didn&#x27;t even know how the product would look when I got it. Some of the &amp;#34;colors&amp;#34; containers were a little messed up - the pads inside that go against the hair - they weren&#x27;t lined up right, I had to take them apart and re-glue them on so I could actually use them. I won&#x27;t order from this company again - although I seen the delivery date, I decided to wait it out - since it was only a gift for me, it wasn&#x27;t THAT big of a deal but geesh, after waiting that long for delivery, it could have been presented better. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to give it as a gift to anyone else - I would have been embarrased. I definately am not worried about exchanging it - I can only imagine how long that would take.</li>
            <li> The only color that wasn&#x27;t broken was green.</li>
            <li> Hot Huez is very messy and it has a very disgusting and cheap texture.</li>
            <li> This is a little messy for the younger girls who want to play with it. I would recommend to ages 12 and up.</li>
            <li> be sure to seal with hair spray - works great</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, and the box came destroyed basically. (Ripped, torn, crinkled, overall damaged.) The Hot Huez themselves were fine, so if you&#x27;re getting these for yourself then go for it!</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool. I like to use this because when I want to change my hair I don&#x27;t have to actually dye it. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and broke easily.</li>
            <li> I agree with all other critical reviews. Do not buy this product!!! It is very cheap, messy, total waste of money. The box was damaged and open when I received it despite a good amount of bubbly cushioning. When I took the box out, the plastic container slipped out and one of the compacts dropped on the floor making a mess all over the kitchen floor.  So I lost one of the four, so much for my daughter&#x27;s birthday present... The rest of the chalks worked ok, they didn&#x27;t leave a straight streak, but rather a dotted line (at least the way my 10-year old girl managed to apply it). If you touch the hair, the chalk dust would come out and will be on your fingers or clothes, or pillow (if you dare sleep with this stuff on). Maybe it is woth a dollar or two, but definitely not $7 or more.</li>
            <li> These do not come out as vibrant as the girls hair on the package.  They were ok for my 8 yr old, but were a little disappointing in the resuls.</li>
            <li> when used in hair press to had on a skinny stran and compact breaks not what was expected  it a nono</li>
            <li> Pulled my niece&#x27;s hair and then rubbed off on all her clothes.</li>
            <li> product is NOT nearly as vibrant as pictures indicate - barely shows up on brunettes or redheads. My girls were very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible,just downright terrible,worst money I&#x27;ve ever spent.First of all it took me literally 5 whole minutes to get the little chalk container thingies to open and when it finally opened chalk went everywhere.Second of all this chalk does not show up on dark hair at all.Third of all this chalk stuff does not wash out easily,I had to scrub my hands with the rough side of the sponge and the chalk is still all over my hands.The color is not vibrant whatsoever and it takes forever to get the color on your hair,when i got the color on my hair every time I would touch my hair chalk would get all over my hands.</li>
            <li> My mother bought me hot huez to try for summer. I&amp;#34;m highly disappointed in this product. It dries out your hair, fades within minutes, and is super messy. It does NOT do as it promises. Save your money.</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck in the compact.  This is defnitely not for curly hair.  (I have straight and my daughter has curly; it puffed her hair right up!)  The colors faded quickly.  I have blonde hair, and people couldn&#x27;t tell that I had the blue in.</li>
            <li> Fun for my 9 year old, but item seemed a little beat-up &amp; not as clean &amp; sturdy as I have seen other similar sets.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors do not work very well if at all. This is the second kind my daughter had tried and remains disappointed.  She was pretty heartbroken. Even with the recommendations in the other reviews, very little color laid on her blond hair. Her best friend was here with brown hair and it didn&#x27;t show up at all for her.</li>
            <li> It did work great and though a bit messy, it made great funky streaks in my daughters hair for crazy hair day at camp. Unfortunately it would not wash out when we went to shampoo at the end of the day. 3 shampoos later and she still has green and blue hair with no sign of washing out, I am trying not to freak out as she had naturally gorgeous platinum hair. Really regret putting it in..</li>
            <li> Fun concept for girls but I wont be buying again. Hard to close especially after use. one of them the sponge came off. Not such an easy slide either without pulling your hair. My daughter and her friend had fun with them but I think next time I will try a different type.</li>
            <li> My child did have fun with it, I just don&#x27;t think the results are worth all the effort and mess.  We followed the instructions and tips and some of the colors showed ok on dark brown hair, but when I was done the sink and floor of my bathroom had residue all over it.  Make sure you use an old towel and do it in the bathroom for easier clean up.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dark, it&#x27;s quite hard to get the colors to show up. My niece had quite a bit of difficulty getting the purple to show up and her hair is blonde. Also, when she&#x27;d use the green and blue chalk, the little sponge would curl up and pull her hair out. The pink chalk is the only one that really worked and gave us no problems. It may be a fluke, but we probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Hot hues is over priced in my opinion. It works semi-well. But works best on light blonde hair or dark brown hair not in between colors.</li>
            <li> Not great at all. I followed directions worst ever</li>
            <li> It works with dark brown hair , you can also get at Ross for $4 by the way. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage niece as a Christmas gift and she loved it.  Her parents loved it too as it quelled her desire to dye her hair.  So,  I bought it again for her birthday.  Hopefully, in keeping her her interested in this non-damaging alternative, my niece will be able to pick and choose colors that will fit her ever-changing mood and style.  I just want her to be happy and to  be able to express herself.</li>
