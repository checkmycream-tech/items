            <li> Excellent quality, this&#x27;s a big bar, lasts a long time, well made. Hard to find, reasonably priced. Arrived quickly. This bar has lasted 6 months, I don&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve ever had a bar of soap that lasted this long, I&#x27;m still not done with it. It has a wonderful characteristic of moistureizing my skin, it cleans very well, without drying out my private parts. Leaves skin velvety and soft and no film on the skin, just completely clean, no overwhelming fragrance. A guy could use this and not feel flowery or feel like the scent would follow him around. What a great soap!</li>
            <li> I love this soap all different fragrances it leaves me clean and fresh, not too much smell just right.</li>
            <li> Superb!  I love this soap and will absolutely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> .I love the scent! What a pick me up!</li>
            <li> Love all the &amp;#34;dead sea minerals&amp;#34; soaps by this company. They lather well, and leave your skin squeaky clean without being dried out.</li>
            <li> Oh how yummy smelling. When this soap arrived, I was so excited. I was surprised at how big the package was for one bar of soap but it surely was packed with care. It smells so good that I want to chomp into it but I didn&#x27;t. I just took a bath and it was delicious feeling. If you like lemon smells, you have to get this soap. It is a little expensive, true, but sometimes you just deserve to treat yourself. I am so glad that I did. It has been several months later and I am still using this soap. it lasts for a very long time and holds its delicious odor. The soap is expensive but as it lasts such a long period of time, it is definitely worth it. I will for sure reorder but my bar is good to go for a few more weeks and maybe months. I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap. Has a beautiful smell. Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product Thank you</li>
            <li> Leathers we&#x27;ll. Very moisturizing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and its aroma - just wish I didn&#x27;t have to pay so much for shipping; it negates the great price!  I only purchased it because I had a gift card.</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap.Will purchase more.</li>
