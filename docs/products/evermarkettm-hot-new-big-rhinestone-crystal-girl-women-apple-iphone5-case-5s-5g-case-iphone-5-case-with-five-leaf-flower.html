            <li> Very pretty and just like the picture. Some stones came off immediately which was disappointing. The gluing on some stones was also not done well but cheap in price so overall I enjoyed it</li>
            <li> The phone case fit my phone fine but look kind of sloppy with all the glue marks on it. I was missing some of the sparke, you could tell where it popped off. Also took a month to get to my home</li>

            <li> I had a slight crack on the corner of the case</li>
            <li> I have had this iPhone 5S case since January 2014 (now it&#x27;s September) NEVER change it. Some of the sparkles sometimes came off but the case came with 5 sparkles that you can easily reattach with simple glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best case plus had lots of COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> They got sloppy on the blue alittle &amp; gets dirty easily if ya know what I mean. But a good case.</li>

            <li> missing studs on case!&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap looking and not to mention I got it with studs missing.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t ever get it again.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality but so cheap I didn&#x27;t expect much. Very pretty and the &#x27;gems&#x27; have not budged!</li>
            <li> want to know why not come my protector</li>
            <li> so not happy with this phone case, can see where they glued everything on.. Feels very cheap. And mine came with a crack it in. Definitely returning it and getting my money back hopefully..</li>
