            <li> This is my favorite powder, goes on like silk, and the fragrance is very sublte.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it daily.  It is mildly scented, not strong.  Great for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the smell!</li>
            <li> I could smell this all day!  Very soft rose scent.  You don&#x27;t need perfume.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product along with Thymes Rose Body Wash and Lotion and this powder, by far, has the best, most beautiful rose scent of the three.  The other products were pricey and does not smell like rose at all. This powder is light, sweet and I get complimented all day when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This powder is soft and smooth and the smell is absolutely amazing. It stays, unlike many other powders. The only thing is that you can&#x27;t use it between your legs if you do any sort of shaving. The fragrance must cause something with my skin, but it&#x27;s great for everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I had not been able to find a rose scented powder to replace one I loved that had been discontinued.  When I did a&lt;br /&gt;Google search &amp; read the reviews on this I went ahead &amp; ordered it.  Honestly, it does not smell much like the rose&lt;br /&gt;scent I was used to,  but it is such a delicate, nice scent that I was still pleased --- also a good price for twice as&lt;br /&gt;much powder than is usually offered for sale.</li>
            <li> Affordable, fragrant but not heavy, plays well with other ros&amp;eacute; scents, and lasts a looooong time. Get it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful talc and such a great price delivered to your door !!</li>

            <li> Love the rose smell so good.</li>
            <li> Very nice rose fragrance!! I am concerned about all talcum powders at this point as there is some concern that it is linked to vaginally accessed cancers- ovarian, etc. I use this carefully. Fragrance stays when puffed onto the body~</li>
            <li> Came fast, smells great, on the pricey side but worth it. Can is maybe 6&amp;#34; tall and 4&amp;#34; wide</li>
            <li> Very nice light rose scent, and soft powder.  I use this every day, and am very happy with it.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> While this powder smells nice, I thought it would be silkier than it is. It is like regular baby powder. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
