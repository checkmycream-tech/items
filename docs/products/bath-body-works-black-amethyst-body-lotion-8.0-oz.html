            <li> Very speedy shipping!! I got it just a few days after ordering!&lt;br /&gt;Black Amethyst has always been my absolute FAVORITE scent from Bath and Body Works so once they discontinued it at the store I was so upset. Then I found it online and almost cried tears of joy! Now I can re-stock and love the way I smell even more! SO HAPPY. :)</li>

            <li> I got this for my friend because it&#x27;s all she wears.  It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to order on Amazon than drive 30 miles to the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely fresh, soft, floral scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> my wife is pleased with this product I am sure she will be buying more</li>
            <li> This scent is intoxicating ... my very favorite B&amp;BW scent</li>

            <li> I bought this because I needed lotion and I love the Black Amethyst body mist. But I thought this was a bit strong. I like my lotion to compliment my different body sprays/be versatile with my body sprays or at least not overpower it and this does overpower it. Unless you&#x27;re wearing the Black Amethyst body mist with it. Then they go together well. Other than that I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my mom and she loved it. The product is not long carried by Bath and Body Works, so I was really glad to find it here.</li>

            <li> AMAZING product! Can&#x27;t say enough about it. It&#x27;s smells AMAZING!!! Just what I was looking for! Highly recommend it! A must buy!</li>
            <li> AWSOME PRODUCT AND SERVICE !!! THANKS !!!</li>
