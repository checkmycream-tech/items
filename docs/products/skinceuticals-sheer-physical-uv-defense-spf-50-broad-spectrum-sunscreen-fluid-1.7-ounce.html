            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The rest of my face where I had applied the sunscreen was as fair as ever.    </li>
            <li>Wish I liked it because it was a great price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; - good stuff</li>
            <li>so I need to investigate that and continue looking for good product.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Works great on its own or paired with a BB cream or foundation.  </li>
            <li>(I have fair, 30&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li>It was a good deal in price except this problem.</li>
            <li>That is a  good product</li>
            <li>I used to have Tizo3 and loved my non grease sunblock</li>
            <li>really good indeed.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value for the science you are getting.</li>
            <li>and it works really good</li>
            <li>I have used this sunscreen before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Both have a very light texture and are great for people with allergies.</li>
            <li>.. love the spf 50!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Been wearing it for a couple of years, love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Can use lotion and or makeup over top; no problems!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>it has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>I have that wonderful menopausal skin that wants to get brown, blotchy spots...</li>
            <li>This is an extremely effective product.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really happy with this facial sunscreen--it&#x27;s everything I needed: unscented, nongreasy, effective, and perfect under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good condition, on time, unopened and authentic.</li>
            <li>I had just worked on a nice self tan to avoid using color moisturizer or make up, but after applying this sunscreen I had to use make up</li>
            <li>so it fits nicely in your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>This is the best high SPF sunscreen I have ever used, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.   </li>
            <li>Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Fairly lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is a very easy formula to apply.  </li>
            <li>It comes off very easy with perspiration.</li>
            <li>Very light weight yet effective.  </li>
            <li>It goes on incredibly well and is absolutely weightless; within a couple of minutes you don&#x27;t even know that you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for really good sun protection</li>
            <li>Best stuff is Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist in Brazil recommended me this product a couple of months ago-it&#x60;s the best we have so far ,he said.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>and this is the best product I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good for protection, but my skin feels silky and smooth after applying it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product from Skinceuticals, I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews about their products, well I was looking for a good sunscreen, at my job I expend time indoors as an outdoors as well.</li>
            <li>Very good product, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had bought many spf&#x27;s ranging in all prices and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>I visit a popular skincare forum and so many people raved about this sunscreen for having good UVA protection (rare in the USA) and being &amp;#34;cosmetically elegant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth under my BB cream.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is very light weight.</li>
            <li>It is matte, and very light.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good sunscreen product for their face!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use u der makeup or on its own.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and does not feel like you have \\&quot;one more thing on your face\\&quot; for the day.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>My dermatologist was the one who turned me on to it, and I&#x27;m so glad I took his advise.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I would compare this product to La Roche Posay Anthelios which I used to use at the recommendation of my dermatologist, but this product is MUCH MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and I use it every day in the summer.  </li>
            <li>but I get way better coverage using Skinceuticals SPF 30 than this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work on an oily skin, but not my Florida skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>One more note regarding the Skinceuticals&#x27; odor.    </li>
            <li>But for now, I am not doing any more sunscreen experiments.</li>
            <li>My skin is more radiant now.</li>
            <li>Love it even if it is pricy.</li>
            <li>After trying many non-chemical sunscreens, I&#x27;ve settled on this one.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Of all that I&#x27;ve tried, THIS is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The physical block ingredients are the best.  </li>
            <li>up seems to go on better</li>
            <li>I think that today&#x27;s creams, like many BB or CC, DD offer a better protection  and sensation.</li>
            <li>Used this for many years.</li>
            <li>Best facial sunscreen ever.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Seriously love this.</li>
            <li>Better than La Roche Posay sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Which I love, because it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on after applying, it does have a scent</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, it&#x27;s a skin-toned sunscreen that works for all skins.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this for a solution.</li>
            <li>It costs here 3 or 4 times  more than if you buy abroad or in Amazon.</li>
            <li>better?</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The greatest selling factor for me personally was how it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the feel and look of this product.</li>
            <li>We bought seven sunscreen!!!!...Totally love the way our skins feel.</li>
            <li>You are even able to use it under your eyes without any irritation.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on so amazingly well, light and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>you will love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite but</li>
            <li>Most sun screens I&#x27;ve tried (many) make my eyes burn</li>
            <li>just much more even.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals Sheer Plysical UV defense SPF 50 is ideal for sun protection!  </li>
            <li>I love how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love skinceuticals SPF.  </li>
            <li>I love this...very light!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist says there is nothing better than it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and blends in easily and yet still works!</li>
            <li>I used this a hand full of times and it works good and light weight.  </li>
            <li>it works good , but first time i got it tinted.</li>
            <li>It is light and blends in super easy and it&#x27;s SPF 50!!  </li>
            <li>It is excellent, It is sheer, absorbs quickly, and leaves your face perfect for the next step, your makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>Most UV products have that oily feel, but this product feels light.</li>
            <li>This product is most like a great product like most skinceuticals products are, but it makes your skin look white.</li>
            <li>It feels light and it is highly potent as well.</li>
            <li>This one, although greasy feeling, goes on very easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smoothly and that I easily can use make-up over it.</li>
            <li>I want to protect against sun, and some cremes are too oily, it will be nice to find the right balance.</li>
            <li>I also have significant and permanent sun damage from not being able to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t severely aggravate my rosecea.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product though is that it is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It also is not greasy and goes on easy under my makeup application.</li>
            <li>Same product that I have grown to love and GREAT price.</li>
            <li>and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical climate and it is good for those conditions.</li>
            <li>I typically wear it under makeup, but it&#x27;s great alone too!  </li>
            <li>The product is a nice consistency, not thick like most sunscreens are.</li>
            <li>For that purpose, it should do just fine.</li>
            <li>It is light and easily applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>works fine.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li>Caution, however, it squirts out quickly because consistency is like water.&lt;br /&gt;Shake before, like a cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, does not turn you white and does a great job of sun protection.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-  NOT oily, which is huge for this greasy monkey&lt;</li>
            <li>huge bonus is this sunscreen&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as can be after applying this product and not a sign of oily feel.  </li>
            <li>and it became smooth immediately..  </li>
            <li>It goes on light w.o.</li>
            <li>Truly fantastic</li>
            <li>This is a light as air sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I like the product because its really light</li>
            <li>It is pricier than Neutrogena to be sure, but it is WORTH it.</li>
            <li>Scent free.  </li>
            <li>Applies smoothly without interfering with application of make up.  </li>
            <li>It goes on lightly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is so light that I don&#x27;t feel it at all.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and after applying this I looked fluorescent.</li>
            <li>It also is free of parabens, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great, light, oil-free</li>
            <li>and it does not run or get greasier when I sweat and the SPF protection is great, although, like most sunscreens, it might need re-application if spending more than a few hours outdoors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>Great daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is so light that it can be worn under make up without causing a pasty feeling.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen worked great on my recent vacation, I came home with no sunburn!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>so light and airy and not at all greasy,</li>
            <li>I would not say this is very water resistant, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or sweating, but for daily use it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>So I ordered it so far so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and it has sunscreen, just great by itself in summer and easily layered in weather that makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this excellent sunscreen as a part of a daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle as all Skinceutical products are, sheer, absorbs quickly and provides great protection!</li>
            <li>and now I just love it, in the hot weather.</li>
            <li>Great product for the face and neck, I&#x27;ve been appliying daily under makeup with no issues at all, love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>not only is it a great sunscreen, it really makes my skin look better when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far superior than anything at the drug store (or even dept stores) and worth every ounce</li>
            <li>It is much more effective than the moisturizer/sunscreen combo that I had been using previously, and I have never come home at the end of the day with &#x27;surprise&#x27; redness or sunburn with this, even when I&#x27;m sure it must have worn off.</li>
            <li>Just spent the week in Hawaii and this product worked great as sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Now, if one wants more coverage, folks who aren&#x27;t Caucasians can probably find something that works for them, too.  </li>
            <li>I had read such good things about it, but in the end it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>This is good but must be rubbed in well or leaves a visible white tint.</li>
            <li>thought I was purchasing  full size item for that price,</li>
            <li>is a nice weight, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure if the sun protection factor is still intact after so much sweating, but since it is water resistant up to 40 minutes</li>
            <li>this one is white and it does not look as good as tinted one.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage and does not feel greasy and seems to last the full day.</li>
            <li>(The Twilight Look may be fine for a cute, chiseled, twenty-something young man but just doesn&#x27;t cut it for a 40-plus woman...)  </li>
            <li>I tried many, many different sunscreens from the drugstore, Mary Kay, cosmetic counters, dermatologists, etc.</li>
            <li>Try Skinceuticals sheer physical UvDefense SPF 50, it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily &amp; it absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish on my oily face, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I totally recommend this.  : )</li>
            <li>so I must say that this was a tremendous value and savings.</li>
            <li>Sinceuticals Sheer Physical Uv Defense is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased;  although somewhat pricey, I think it does wonders for your complexion.  </li>
            <li>Slightly burns at first, but I think it is very good.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff: no wierd white cast to my face, very light texture (feels much the same as the Skinceuticals), pleasant scent.      </li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen that I can boast is light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>First a little background on my skin: I&#x27;m 43, very fair (I always burn and never tan)</li>
            <li>I originally chalked this up to the hot, humid weather in Thailand</li>
            <li>I got this when I went for a facial and love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really like this light formula for days when I will be out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on great over it too, this will be my everyday sunscreen from now on.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is light, airy and non-sticky;</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m home and back to order more of this fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I make my own skin serum that I use daily as a moisturizer and for skin and cell repair</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable using this on my skin daily.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to order the tinted version, but the untinted one is just as nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have that white finish and matts out your makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>A tad costly but well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it until I found out that it&#x27;s UVA rating is very very low, despite the high SPF (read UVB) rating.</li>
            <li>Plus- came right to my door.</li>
            <li>but it goes away right away</li>
            <li>Feels better under make-up, and Lakota less greasy/ shininess you get from Most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This goes on so easily and is sheer once you smooth it on.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried MANY brands, from the store brands like Neutrogena to the super high-end brands that I can only buy at my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if the SPF and UV defense is any good as I do notice my dark spots still getting darker</li>
            <li>very lightweight and works the best above all other sunscreens for the face</li>
            <li>Am always on the lookout for a chemical free sunblock as my eyes are very sensitive to anything</li>
            <li>Many people said it leaves the skin white, but it is just a matter finding de right amount.</li>
            <li>This could very much be what saves your face from premature wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Very fast deliver.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun very much</li>
            <li>Too many times, I either felt like I had bathroom caulk on my face or looked like an extra in a vampire movie.  </li>
            <li>And, just to ensure that I had enough on hand, I waited to write this until I placed an order for two more bottles.  ;~)   </li>
            <li>The first spf that does not give me breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogina oil free moisturizer for Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t cut it for me, so I reluctantly switched to Neutrogena, which promised a higher UVA rating (although they don&#x27;t list UVA ratings in the US).</li>
            <li>I am an avid outdoor person and need every barrier I can use to protect my sentive skin to sun.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this when in the hot summer sun.</li>
            <li>Elta Physical sunscreen is much better.</li>
            <li>Re-application is needed after swimming, but this is the case with most facial sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I need to use about a nickel-size worth and gently blend in.</li>
            <li>Passed the intense sun of summer in Hawaii!</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>You have to try it because once you do, you will continue to buy it in the future :)</li>
            <li>I actually returned cle de peau because this was better.</li>
            <li>I apply vitamin C serum first (for added protection from sun damage).  </li>
            <li>Before, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer 50 SPF.  </li>
            <li>but it smells like rancid food when it first comes out of the bottle and is spread on the face.  </li>
            <li>I love the sheer application and that it protects your skin from the damaging rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li>I am an x New York model, now in my early 60&#x27;s, and I am so glad my plastic doc sells this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this due to so many great reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, but I do like how light the texture is and the slight sheen it leaves on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I know that physical sunscreens are superior to their chemical counterparts, but I&#x27;ve never before encountered one that wouldn&#x27;t make my face look like a mask or run it white streaks when I went to the gym and broke a sweat.</li>
            <li>Most women wear at least a powder and most of us wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I used to use Physical Defense SPF 30 because it was the best out there, but I thought it was too thick.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I do know that it goes on very light and dry, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>thin and light tho exceptional coverage</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask or leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly tinted, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this sunscreen, especially since it&#x27;s a great deal and provides reliable broad spectrum sun protection through physical filters.</li>
            <li>I bought the small size to make sure I liked it - but I am going to order a larger one and keep this one for travel.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is better since it has a nice tint to it, but it still makes my face very pale and has a white tint to it</li>
            <li>I always do a two step face wash at the end of the day (an oil based product to remove makeup, then another gentle cleanser following that), and it seems to come off fine.</li>
            <li>and this is the first sunscreen with a high SPF that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and no issue with a white residue.</li>
            <li>The matte finish really helps skin stay moist without that greasy sunscreen feeling.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely reeks.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, after a couple of minutes the odor goes away, but initially it&#x27;s a bit of a shocker.  </li>
            <li>so I only use it on my face and neck and use cheap stuff on my hands and the rest of me.</li>
            <li>I really like this because it does not feel greasy and it works well.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, invisible, very protective.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a matte finish as well which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just use this one when I&#x27;m working out in my garden and not worried so much about my appearance.  </li>
            <li>It goes on invisibly, and works really well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I will use it sparingly but really like that it feels invisible when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma once, I really needed to find one I could wear.  </li>
            <li>Also, seemed pricey when I got it, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well</li>
            <li>It is sheer and light.  </li>
            <li>Very sheer, feels light on face.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>Very gentle, non-greasy, and after months of use I have had no adverse skin reactions to the ingredients even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>How many other products can claim that???)</li>
            <li>Better than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The box looked old and beat up, and though the bottle was full, I will buy my sunblock from Skinceuticals directly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a sunscreen that would fit all of my requirements - high spf, matte finish, won&#x27;t run when I sweat and work out, won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It spread easily and the skin gets a soft touch,besides protection of course.&lt;br /&gt;In Brazil,the only problem is the price.</li>
            <li>I like how light it is, it spreads easily and dries virtually sheer, and other creams and make-up layer well over it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting, very effective, small enough for carry on travel.</li>
            <li>Blends quickly, pretty effective, no white streaks, not shiny, doesn&#x27;t make me look oddly purple as some sunscreens do</li>
            <li>Last time I was back in the States, I visited the Clarins counter at Nordstrom to purchase more.   </li>
            <li>particular screen uses the uva blocking mineral sunscreens that are non-toxic on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the sheer fluid with tint.</li>
            <li>After trying a myriad of facial sunscreens, this one has been my favorite for several years.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a firm believer in wearing sunscreen but really didn&#x27;t like the consistency of many of the brands I&#x27;ve used (Olay, Neutrogena, Eucerin and Philosophy).  </li>
            <li>I have SUPER oily skin and prior to using this product I had tried tons of products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>For areas other than my face, I use the neutrogena pure and free baby sunblock.</li>
            <li>and that I need a higher SPF especially because I have light red marks on my face after using accutane.</li>
            <li>So, I embarked upon a quest for a non-goopy, non-ooky, non-whitening zinc/titanium oxide based, high SPF sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people with combination skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>WE SENSITIVE SKIN FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!  </li>
            <li>I love all the product details, but this product clogged my pores and I started getting little blackheads.</li>
            <li>The product is gentle on my sensitive skin and it protects it in the high desert sun.</li>
            <li>It almost instantly disappears into my very dry skin areas while my very oily T-zone stays oil free!  </li>
            <li>It has finally gotten warm and sunny enough outside that</li>
            <li>so I can get my normal skinceuticals sunblock.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Sheer Physical UV Defense SPF50 after using and loving the Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF50.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, and itlooks so good on your face that you&#x27;ll be able to get by with either nothing but blush or a light powder.  </li>
            <li>Sheer coverage, a little goes a long way, it does a great job of protecting my skin, has no offensive odor, and it&#x27;s sweat resistant.</li>
            <li>Yes, I only gave it 4 stars because the smell is a bit sour when it&#x27;s first applied, but it goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re looking for a more water resistant physical sunscreen, I&#x27;ve used MD SolarSciences SPF 50 and it works very well, but does break me out a little).  </li>
            <li>Well, this sunscreen is not like other physical sunscreens: it leaves a matte finish without a white cast (at least for me, I am very fair skinned), it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it has a very high and proven UVA and UVB, and it doesn&#x27;t run as much when I am at the gym.</li>
            <li>It is far less noticeable than the fallene cotz sunscreen which is much thicker, more opaque and just generally gross.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and need a serious everyday sunscreen without chemicals I&#x27;d prefer to avoid.</li>
            <li>When it first went on it felt greasy, but that was short lived</li>
            <li>I first tried this product as a sample from a local spa...and immediately looked it up on Amazon when I ran out.  </li>
            <li>For those of you with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li>I do hot yoga daily and rinse my face off with water after class and this sunscreen stays on my skins even after that...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know Skinceuticals products and was surprised by its quality!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this sunscreen goes on so smooth - and the matte finish leaves my face looking and feeling less shiny.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s broad spectrum which is highly recommend by dermatologist.</li>
            <li>SPF (I typically see only 15 SPF in most products)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but there is a slight white cast that becomes more noticeable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a silk like powder, very light and doesn&#x27;t feel thick under your makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can only use this product in certain situations if that is the case.  </li>
            <li>So glad the little girl at the spa recommended this during my facial!</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t clear and will stay whitish.</li>
            <li>Clearly from a faulty batch and way beyond its sell by date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obagi SPF 50 and Neutrogena brand sunblocks and so far this one is my fave.</li>
            <li>It blocks out both UVA and UVB rays but the formula is very lightweight so it does not cause break outs, it does not leave a white residue on the skin</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t expire until 2012, and the box was completely sealed.  </li>
            <li>I hope they keep making it forever, or at least until something better comes around.</li>
            <li>dont use too much tho.. will be white if u do...</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon to save money on shipping, but felt like I might be getting a product that was either old or inferior from this seller.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Does not look natural at all</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much to cover the entire face and neck and has titanium dioxide, which helps control breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like the sheer feeling you get after application.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin?).  </li>
            <li>It is a fluid, which will not give as much moisture as some creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>I had to really put on a lot of bronzer to cover the Casper-like shade this left on my face( even under tinted moisturizer...)</li>
            <li>Goes on white but soaks into skin fast.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have skin thai is both sensitive and acne prone, but this product does not cause itching, stinging or breakouts.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-works well for my oily and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If I would have purchased directly from Skinceuticals it would have cost $44 bucks</li>
            <li>In addition, my skin is really sensitive and almost every product irritated my face.  </li>
            <li>you have oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to get this-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of [[ASIN:B000NCA7NU Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 - Skin Ceuticals - Day Care - 90ml/3oz]] for years and decided to try this one instead, I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife and she said it&#x27;s was worth every dollar spent on it.</li>
            <li>this product is the best base for makup.  </li>
            <li>However it does not blend easy and is very white which is expected from a sunscreen offering such high protection.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s apply, I am very sensitive to strong smells, it&#x27;s smell is not strong, I&#x27;d say instead doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all!.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, does not leave excessive white cast (a little at first but quickly fades), has not clogged my pores, which is often a problem for me with skin products.</li>
            <li>and I can tell its protecting my face because my red marks arent becoming redder and im not getting little brown freckles on my face anymore.</li>
            <li>It has the zinc oxide physical block that my doctor recommends, but at the same time it is incredibly sheer and blends quickly.</li>
            <li>At first the Sheer appears a bit white.</li>
            <li>highly potent even with such a small amount so I can wear under my makeup even with oily skin</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is so light and liquidy, and less greasy than my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Seems to provide very sufficient, protective coverage in a extremely thin emulsion that&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have oil skin, it keeps my skin dry for the whole day, wonderfull under make up.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and absorbs quickly with no sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>It has protected me like no other sunscreen and the spots are almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I tried again when I was back in The States and my skin was clear only to get a new crop of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The only slight issue I have with this sunscreen is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s nothing offensive, and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not irritate my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>only product that works for my acne skin is Elta MD Clear.</li>
            <li>It also works well under make-up (I use it under Bare Minerals).  </li>
            <li>Extremely sheer, no ghost face action</li>
            <li>It is weightless and natural, but I&#x27;ve realized that it doesn&#x27;t protect enough!!!</li>
            <li>and it barely has a scent.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Ti Silc without green tea, their new product is very drying, and not at all what I expect from Ti Silc.  </li>
            <li>Made my normally oily skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>While at the derm to try and take care of the newly created acne problem I was having, I came across Skinceuticals Sheer Physical Devense sunscreen and decided to give it a try, since there was nothing out there that I could possibly use.</li>
            <li>but it is thin and does dry clear, therefore, applying makeup on top of it</li>
            <li>This is such an improvement over the old Skinceuticals facial sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product especially if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle --- $64 down the drain.</li>
            <li>But they went too far the other direction, and it is completely drying.</li>
            <li>clear (never a white cast, but not a physical sunblock, either) for every day, but I will def try this out at the beach next month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few physical sunscreens with an spf of 30 or greater and have had so much trouble finding one that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>So, I clearly need a heavy duty sunscreen or I have to live like a vampire.  </li>
            <li>When this product arrived to my door and I looked at it, my first impression was \\&quot;what a small bottle\\&quot; but the time was passing by and a little goes a long way, believe me a small bottle like this last forever, what I always do is to don&#x27;t press the bottle too much, the product is liquid so it will comes out quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this new bottle on Dec. 4, 2012 and just used it the other day, and the scent just knocked me over.  </li>
            <li>Any little sun exposure and my face is full of dark pigment spots.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I has wonderful, non-irritating and non-harmful ingredients, and I will continue to reorder it.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect.  </li>
            <li> GREAT sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> The best sunscreen i have been used.</li>
            <li> (And the seller is perfectly reliable.)</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is perfect.  </li>
            <li> You will be impressed with this formula.</li>
            <li> Awesome sunscreen, recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The best block I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I had read marvelous comments about this sunscreen</li>
            <li> This product is the best for my darker complexion and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> However, since my BB cream has quite a bit of moisture, this is the perfect combo for that.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best suncreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Especially great for people who suffer from skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used for my face.</li>
            <li> Provides excellent protection.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist as one of the best face sun lotion.</li>
            <li> It has the perfect texture and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Very happy!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, just too pricey for the size of the bottle you get.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It can be used as an under make up brightener because it&#x27;s smoothens your skin&#x27;s texture which makes you look flawless.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  </li>
            <li> Excellent.  </li>
            <li> feels awesome</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li> I was referred this product by friend who&#x27;s dermatologist said it was very good.</li>
            <li> Great face sunscreen, one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> Goes great with layers of face creams and makeup.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> great price...</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> However, I do like to use this product on my hands and arms as it does provide great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great but a bit pricey for the amount you get</li>
            <li> and this is working great.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of protecting my skin without causing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This  product was recommended by my Dermatologist and the benefits are great.</li>
            <li> Great feeling when applied to skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Altho pricey,  this sunscreen is great for the face.  </li>
            <li> This is a great sun screen, SPF 50, to wear with our without make-up.</li>
            <li> I am vey happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock I have combination skin</li>
            <li> It works great as a sunscreen, but what I was looking for was the tinted sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> great product</li>
            <li> Very, very effective.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the Skinceuticals SPF 30 which I have used for 10 years successfully with no acne.</li>
            <li> Phew! :) Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> he liked it - no fuss anymore!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The rest of my face where I had applied the sunscreen was as fair as ever.    </li>
            <li> Wish I liked it because it was a great price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; - good stuff</li>
            <li> so I need to investigate that and continue looking for good product.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Works great on its own or paired with a BB cream or foundation.  </li>
            <li> (I have fair, 30&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li> It was a good deal in price except this problem.</li>
            <li> That is a  good product</li>
            <li> I used to have Tizo3 and loved my non grease sunblock</li>
            <li> really good indeed.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value for the science you are getting.</li>
            <li> and it works really good</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Both have a very light texture and are great for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> .. love the spf 50!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Been wearing it for a couple of years, love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Can use lotion and or makeup over top; no problems!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> it has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li> I have that wonderful menopausal skin that wants to get brown, blotchy spots...</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective product.</li>
            <li> and it looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really happy with this facial sunscreen--it&#x27;s everything I needed: unscented, nongreasy, effective, and perfect under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition, on time, unopened and authentic.</li>
            <li> I had just worked on a nice self tan to avoid using color moisturizer or make up, but after applying this sunscreen I had to use make up</li>
            <li> so it fits nicely in your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> This is the best high SPF sunscreen I have ever used, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.   </li>
            <li> Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Fairly lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy formula to apply.  </li>
            <li> It comes off very easy with perspiration.</li>
            <li> Very light weight yet effective.  </li>
            <li> It goes on incredibly well and is absolutely weightless; within a couple of minutes you don&#x27;t even know that you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous for really good sun protection</li>
            <li> Best stuff is Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist in Brazil recommended me this product a couple of months ago-it&#x60;s the best we have so far ,he said.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> and this is the best product I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good for protection, but my skin feels silky and smooth after applying it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product from Skinceuticals, I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews about their products, well I was looking for a good sunscreen, at my job I expend time indoors as an outdoors as well.</li>
            <li> Very good product, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had bought many spf&#x27;s ranging in all prices and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li> I visit a popular skincare forum and so many people raved about this sunscreen for having good UVA protection (rare in the USA) and being &amp;#34;cosmetically elegant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very light.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth under my BB cream.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is very light weight.</li>
            <li> It is matte, and very light.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good sunscreen product for their face!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use u der makeup or on its own.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and does not feel like you have \\&quot;one more thing on your face\\&quot; for the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-</li>
            <li> My dermatologist was the one who turned me on to it, and I&#x27;m so glad I took his advise.  </li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I would compare this product to La Roche Posay Anthelios which I used to use at the recommendation of my dermatologist, but this product is MUCH MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and I use it every day in the summer.  </li>
            <li> but I get way better coverage using Skinceuticals SPF 30 than this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will work on an oily skin, but not my Florida skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> One more note regarding the Skinceuticals&#x27; odor.    </li>
            <li> But for now, I am not doing any more sunscreen experiments.</li>
            <li> My skin is more radiant now.</li>
            <li> Love it even if it is pricy.</li>
            <li> After trying many non-chemical sunscreens, I&#x27;ve settled on this one.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Of all that I&#x27;ve tried, THIS is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The physical block ingredients are the best.  </li>
            <li> up seems to go on better</li>
            <li> I think that today&#x27;s creams, like many BB or CC, DD offer a better protection  and sensation.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen ever.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Seriously love this.</li>
            <li> Better than La Roche Posay sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Which I love, because it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on after applying, it does have a scent</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it&#x27;s a skin-toned sunscreen that works for all skins.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this for a solution.</li>
            <li> It costs here 3 or 4 times  more than if you buy abroad or in Amazon.</li>
            <li> better?</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The greatest selling factor for me personally was how it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feel and look of this product.</li>
            <li> We bought seven sunscreen!!!!...Totally love the way our skins feel.</li>
            <li> You are even able to use it under your eyes without any irritation.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so amazingly well, light and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but</li>
            <li> Most sun screens I&#x27;ve tried (many) make my eyes burn</li>
            <li> just much more even.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals Sheer Plysical UV defense SPF 50 is ideal for sun protection!  </li>
            <li> I love how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love skinceuticals SPF.  </li>
            <li> I love this...very light!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says there is nothing better than it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and blends in easily and yet still works!</li>
            <li> I used this a hand full of times and it works good and light weight.  </li>
            <li> it works good , but first time i got it tinted.</li>
            <li> It is light and blends in super easy and it&#x27;s SPF 50!!  </li>
            <li> It is excellent, It is sheer, absorbs quickly, and leaves your face perfect for the next step, your makeup.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and light.  </li>
            <li> Most UV products have that oily feel, but this product feels light.</li>
            <li> This product is most like a great product like most skinceuticals products are, but it makes your skin look white.</li>
            <li> It feels light and it is highly potent as well.</li>
            <li> This one, although greasy feeling, goes on very easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smoothly and that I easily can use make-up over it.</li>
            <li> I want to protect against sun, and some cremes are too oily, it will be nice to find the right balance.</li>
            <li> I also have significant and permanent sun damage from not being able to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t severely aggravate my rosecea.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this product though is that it is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It also is not greasy and goes on easy under my makeup application.</li>
            <li> Same product that I have grown to love and GREAT price.</li>
            <li> and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical climate and it is good for those conditions.</li>
            <li> I typically wear it under makeup, but it&#x27;s great alone too!  </li>
            <li> The product is a nice consistency, not thick like most sunscreens are.</li>
            <li> For that purpose, it should do just fine.</li>
            <li> It is light and easily applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> works fine.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li> Caution, however, it squirts out quickly because consistency is like water.&lt;br /&gt;Shake before, like a cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, does not turn you white and does a great job of sun protection.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-  NOT oily, which is huge for this greasy monkey&lt;</li>
            <li> huge bonus is this sunscreen&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth as can be after applying this product and not a sign of oily feel.  </li>
            <li> and it became smooth immediately..  </li>
            <li> It goes on light w.o.</li>
            <li> Truly fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a light as air sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like the product because its really light</li>
            <li> It is pricier than Neutrogena to be sure, but it is WORTH it.</li>
            <li> Scent free.  </li>
            <li> Applies smoothly without interfering with application of make up.  </li>
            <li> It goes on lightly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is so light that I don&#x27;t feel it at all.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and after applying this I looked fluorescent.</li>
            <li> It also is free of parabens, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great, light, oil-free</li>
            <li> and it does not run or get greasier when I sweat and the SPF protection is great, although, like most sunscreens, it might need re-application if spending more than a few hours outdoors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Great daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so light that it can be worn under make up without causing a pasty feeling.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen worked great on my recent vacation, I came home with no sunburn!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> so light and airy and not at all greasy,</li>
            <li> I would not say this is very water resistant, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or sweating, but for daily use it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> So I ordered it so far so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and it has sunscreen, just great by itself in summer and easily layered in weather that makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this excellent sunscreen as a part of a daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle as all Skinceutical products are, sheer, absorbs quickly and provides great protection!</li>
            <li> and now I just love it, in the hot weather.</li>
            <li> Great product for the face and neck, I&#x27;ve been appliying daily under makeup with no issues at all, love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> not only is it a great sunscreen, it really makes my skin look better when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far superior than anything at the drug store (or even dept stores) and worth every ounce</li>
            <li> It is much more effective than the moisturizer/sunscreen combo that I had been using previously, and I have never come home at the end of the day with &#x27;surprise&#x27; redness or sunburn with this, even when I&#x27;m sure it must have worn off.</li>
            <li> Just spent the week in Hawaii and this product worked great as sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Now, if one wants more coverage, folks who aren&#x27;t Caucasians can probably find something that works for them, too.  </li>
            <li> I had read such good things about it, but in the end it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is good but must be rubbed in well or leaves a visible white tint.</li>
            <li> thought I was purchasing  full size item for that price,</li>
            <li> is a nice weight, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure if the sun protection factor is still intact after so much sweating, but since it is water resistant up to 40 minutes</li>
            <li> this one is white and it does not look as good as tinted one.</li>
            <li> It has good coverage and does not feel greasy and seems to last the full day.</li>
            <li> (The Twilight Look may be fine for a cute, chiseled, twenty-something young man but just doesn&#x27;t cut it for a 40-plus woman...)  </li>
            <li> I tried many, many different sunscreens from the drugstore, Mary Kay, cosmetic counters, dermatologists, etc.</li>
            <li> Try Skinceuticals sheer physical UvDefense SPF 50, it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily &amp; it absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish on my oily face, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I totally recommend this.  : )</li>
            <li> so I must say that this was a tremendous value and savings.</li>
            <li> Sinceuticals Sheer Physical Uv Defense is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased;  although somewhat pricey, I think it does wonders for your complexion.  </li>
            <li> Slightly burns at first, but I think it is very good.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff: no wierd white cast to my face, very light texture (feels much the same as the Skinceuticals), pleasant scent.      </li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen that I can boast is light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> First a little background on my skin: I&#x27;m 43, very fair (I always burn and never tan)</li>
            <li> I originally chalked this up to the hot, humid weather in Thailand</li>
            <li> I got this when I went for a facial and love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this light formula for days when I will be out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on great over it too, this will be my everyday sunscreen from now on.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is light, airy and non-sticky;</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m home and back to order more of this fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I make my own skin serum that I use daily as a moisturizer and for skin and cell repair</li>
            <li> I feel more comfortable using this on my skin daily.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to order the tinted version, but the untinted one is just as nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that white finish and matts out your makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> A tad costly but well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it until I found out that it&#x27;s UVA rating is very very low, despite the high SPF (read UVB) rating.</li>
            <li> Plus- came right to my door.</li>
            <li> but it goes away right away</li>
            <li> Feels better under make-up, and Lakota less greasy/ shininess you get from Most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This goes on so easily and is sheer once you smooth it on.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried MANY brands, from the store brands like Neutrogena to the super high-end brands that I can only buy at my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the SPF and UV defense is any good as I do notice my dark spots still getting darker</li>
            <li> very lightweight and works the best above all other sunscreens for the face</li>
            <li> Am always on the lookout for a chemical free sunblock as my eyes are very sensitive to anything</li>
            <li> Many people said it leaves the skin white, but it is just a matter finding de right amount.</li>
            <li> This could very much be what saves your face from premature wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Very fast deliver.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun very much</li>
            <li> Too many times, I either felt like I had bathroom caulk on my face or looked like an extra in a vampire movie.  </li>
            <li> And, just to ensure that I had enough on hand, I waited to write this until I placed an order for two more bottles.  ;~)   </li>
            <li> The first spf that does not give me breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogina oil free moisturizer for Sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t cut it for me, so I reluctantly switched to Neutrogena, which promised a higher UVA rating (although they don&#x27;t list UVA ratings in the US).</li>
            <li> I am an avid outdoor person and need every barrier I can use to protect my sentive skin to sun.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this when in the hot summer sun.</li>
            <li> Elta Physical sunscreen is much better.</li>
            <li> Re-application is needed after swimming, but this is the case with most facial sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I need to use about a nickel-size worth and gently blend in.</li>
            <li> Passed the intense sun of summer in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> You have to try it because once you do, you will continue to buy it in the future :)</li>
            <li> I actually returned cle de peau because this was better.</li>
            <li> I apply vitamin C serum first (for added protection from sun damage).  </li>
            <li> Before, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer 50 SPF.  </li>
            <li> but it smells like rancid food when it first comes out of the bottle and is spread on the face.  </li>
            <li> I love the sheer application and that it protects your skin from the damaging rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li> I am an x New York model, now in my early 60&#x27;s, and I am so glad my plastic doc sells this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this due to so many great reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, but I do like how light the texture is and the slight sheen it leaves on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I know that physical sunscreens are superior to their chemical counterparts, but I&#x27;ve never before encountered one that wouldn&#x27;t make my face look like a mask or run it white streaks when I went to the gym and broke a sweat.</li>
            <li> Most women wear at least a powder and most of us wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I used to use Physical Defense SPF 30 because it was the best out there, but I thought it was too thick.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I do know that it goes on very light and dry, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> thin and light tho exceptional coverage</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask or leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly tinted, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this sunscreen, especially since it&#x27;s a great deal and provides reliable broad spectrum sun protection through physical filters.</li>
            <li> I bought the small size to make sure I liked it - but I am going to order a larger one and keep this one for travel.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is better since it has a nice tint to it, but it still makes my face very pale and has a white tint to it</li>
            <li> I always do a two step face wash at the end of the day (an oil based product to remove makeup, then another gentle cleanser following that), and it seems to come off fine.</li>
            <li> and this is the first sunscreen with a high SPF that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and no issue with a white residue.</li>
            <li> The matte finish really helps skin stay moist without that greasy sunscreen feeling.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely reeks.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, after a couple of minutes the odor goes away, but initially it&#x27;s a bit of a shocker.  </li>
            <li> so I only use it on my face and neck and use cheap stuff on my hands and the rest of me.</li>
            <li> I really like this because it does not feel greasy and it works well.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, invisible, very protective.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a matte finish as well which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just use this one when I&#x27;m working out in my garden and not worried so much about my appearance.  </li>
            <li> It goes on invisibly, and works really well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I will use it sparingly but really like that it feels invisible when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma once, I really needed to find one I could wear.  </li>
            <li> Also, seemed pricey when I got it, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well</li>
            <li> It is sheer and light.  </li>
            <li> Very sheer, feels light on face.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Very gentle, non-greasy, and after months of use I have had no adverse skin reactions to the ingredients even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> How many other products can claim that???)</li>
            <li> Better than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The box looked old and beat up, and though the bottle was full, I will buy my sunblock from Skinceuticals directly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a sunscreen that would fit all of my requirements - high spf, matte finish, won&#x27;t run when I sweat and work out, won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It spread easily and the skin gets a soft touch,besides protection of course.&lt;br /&gt;In Brazil,the only problem is the price.</li>
            <li> I like how light it is, it spreads easily and dries virtually sheer, and other creams and make-up layer well over it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting, very effective, small enough for carry on travel.</li>
            <li> Blends quickly, pretty effective, no white streaks, not shiny, doesn&#x27;t make me look oddly purple as some sunscreens do</li>
            <li> Last time I was back in the States, I visited the Clarins counter at Nordstrom to purchase more.   </li>
            <li> particular screen uses the uva blocking mineral sunscreens that are non-toxic on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the sheer fluid with tint.</li>
            <li> After trying a myriad of facial sunscreens, this one has been my favorite for several years.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a firm believer in wearing sunscreen but really didn&#x27;t like the consistency of many of the brands I&#x27;ve used (Olay, Neutrogena, Eucerin and Philosophy).  </li>
            <li> I have SUPER oily skin and prior to using this product I had tried tons of products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> For areas other than my face, I use the neutrogena pure and free baby sunblock.</li>
            <li> and that I need a higher SPF especially because I have light red marks on my face after using accutane.</li>
            <li> So, I embarked upon a quest for a non-goopy, non-ooky, non-whitening zinc/titanium oxide based, high SPF sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people with combination skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> WE SENSITIVE SKIN FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!  </li>
            <li> I love all the product details, but this product clogged my pores and I started getting little blackheads.</li>
            <li> The product is gentle on my sensitive skin and it protects it in the high desert sun.</li>
            <li> It almost instantly disappears into my very dry skin areas while my very oily T-zone stays oil free!  </li>
            <li> It has finally gotten warm and sunny enough outside that</li>
            <li> so I can get my normal skinceuticals sunblock.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Sheer Physical UV Defense SPF50 after using and loving the Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF50.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, and itlooks so good on your face that you&#x27;ll be able to get by with either nothing but blush or a light powder.  </li>
            <li> Sheer coverage, a little goes a long way, it does a great job of protecting my skin, has no offensive odor, and it&#x27;s sweat resistant.</li>
            <li> Yes, I only gave it 4 stars because the smell is a bit sour when it&#x27;s first applied, but it goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re looking for a more water resistant physical sunscreen, I&#x27;ve used MD SolarSciences SPF 50 and it works very well, but does break me out a little).  </li>
            <li> Well, this sunscreen is not like other physical sunscreens: it leaves a matte finish without a white cast (at least for me, I am very fair skinned), it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it has a very high and proven UVA and UVB, and it doesn&#x27;t run as much when I am at the gym.</li>
            <li> It is far less noticeable than the fallene cotz sunscreen which is much thicker, more opaque and just generally gross.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and need a serious everyday sunscreen without chemicals I&#x27;d prefer to avoid.</li>
            <li> When it first went on it felt greasy, but that was short lived</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample from a local spa...and immediately looked it up on Amazon when I ran out.  </li>
            <li> For those of you with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I do hot yoga daily and rinse my face off with water after class and this sunscreen stays on my skins even after that...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Skinceuticals products and was surprised by its quality!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this sunscreen goes on so smooth - and the matte finish leaves my face looking and feeling less shiny.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s broad spectrum which is highly recommend by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> SPF (I typically see only 15 SPF in most products)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there is a slight white cast that becomes more noticeable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a silk like powder, very light and doesn&#x27;t feel thick under your makeup.  </li>
            <li> I can only use this product in certain situations if that is the case.  </li>
            <li> So glad the little girl at the spa recommended this during my facial!</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t clear and will stay whitish.</li>
            <li> Clearly from a faulty batch and way beyond its sell by date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi SPF 50 and Neutrogena brand sunblocks and so far this one is my fave.</li>
            <li> It blocks out both UVA and UVB rays but the formula is very lightweight so it does not cause break outs, it does not leave a white residue on the skin</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t expire until 2012, and the box was completely sealed.  </li>
            <li> I hope they keep making it forever, or at least until something better comes around.</li>
            <li> dont use too much tho.. will be white if u do...</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon to save money on shipping, but felt like I might be getting a product that was either old or inferior from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Does not look natural at all</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much to cover the entire face and neck and has titanium dioxide, which helps control breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like the sheer feeling you get after application.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin?).  </li>
            <li> It is a fluid, which will not give as much moisture as some creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> I had to really put on a lot of bronzer to cover the Casper-like shade this left on my face( even under tinted moisturizer...)</li>
            <li> Goes on white but soaks into skin fast.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have skin thai is both sensitive and acne prone, but this product does not cause itching, stinging or breakouts.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-works well for my oily and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If I would have purchased directly from Skinceuticals it would have cost $44 bucks</li>
            <li> In addition, my skin is really sensitive and almost every product irritated my face.  </li>
            <li> you have oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to get this-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of [[ASIN:B000NCA7NU Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 - Skin Ceuticals - Day Care - 90ml/3oz]] for years and decided to try this one instead, I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she said it&#x27;s was worth every dollar spent on it.</li>
            <li> this product is the best base for makup.  </li>
            <li> However it does not blend easy and is very white which is expected from a sunscreen offering such high protection.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s apply, I am very sensitive to strong smells, it&#x27;s smell is not strong, I&#x27;d say instead doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all!.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, does not leave excessive white cast (a little at first but quickly fades), has not clogged my pores, which is often a problem for me with skin products.</li>
            <li> and I can tell its protecting my face because my red marks arent becoming redder and im not getting little brown freckles on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> It has the zinc oxide physical block that my doctor recommends, but at the same time it is incredibly sheer and blends quickly.</li>
            <li> At first the Sheer appears a bit white.</li>
            <li> highly potent even with such a small amount so I can wear under my makeup even with oily skin</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so light and liquidy, and less greasy than my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Seems to provide very sufficient, protective coverage in a extremely thin emulsion that&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have oil skin, it keeps my skin dry for the whole day, wonderfull under make up.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and absorbs quickly with no sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> It has protected me like no other sunscreen and the spots are almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I tried again when I was back in The States and my skin was clear only to get a new crop of blemishes.</li>
            <li> The only slight issue I have with this sunscreen is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s nothing offensive, and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not irritate my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> only product that works for my acne skin is Elta MD Clear.</li>
            <li> It also works well under make-up (I use it under Bare Minerals).  </li>
            <li> Extremely sheer, no ghost face action</li>
            <li> It is weightless and natural, but I&#x27;ve realized that it doesn&#x27;t protect enough!!!</li>
            <li> and it barely has a scent.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Ti Silc without green tea, their new product is very drying, and not at all what I expect from Ti Silc.  </li>
            <li> Made my normally oily skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> While at the derm to try and take care of the newly created acne problem I was having, I came across Skinceuticals Sheer Physical Devense sunscreen and decided to give it a try, since there was nothing out there that I could possibly use.</li>
            <li> but it is thin and does dry clear, therefore, applying makeup on top of it</li>
            <li> This is such an improvement over the old Skinceuticals facial sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product especially if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle --- $64 down the drain.</li>
            <li> But they went too far the other direction, and it is completely drying.</li>
            <li> clear (never a white cast, but not a physical sunblock, either) for every day, but I will def try this out at the beach next month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few physical sunscreens with an spf of 30 or greater and have had so much trouble finding one that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> So, I clearly need a heavy duty sunscreen or I have to live like a vampire.  </li>
            <li> When this product arrived to my door and I looked at it, my first impression was \\&quot;what a small bottle\\&quot; but the time was passing by and a little goes a long way, believe me a small bottle like this last forever, what I always do is to don&#x27;t press the bottle too much, the product is liquid so it will comes out quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this new bottle on Dec. 4, 2012 and just used it the other day, and the scent just knocked me over.  </li>
            <li> Any little sun exposure and my face is full of dark pigment spots.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as nice as the skinceuticals (thicker and harder to blend), but is far less expensive and is also a physical sunblock for uva and uvb protection.</li>
            <li> As an added side benefit it seems to leave a subtle glow on my skin once it is absorbed (You know that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; I am talking about?</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not greasy, lasts all day, and one small bottle lasts at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Last week before a trip I realized I was running low and tried picking up a couple of potential alternatives with other last-minute travel supplies.  </li>
            <li> liquid, so requires far less product to do the job.  </li>
            <li> - the only thing my serum is missing is sunscreen - I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a product that mixes well with natural and unrefined oils, until I found the Skinceuticals line.  </li>
            <li> Also, throughout the course of the day, I noticed my skin was not any less oily than it normally is with the other Skinceuticals Ultimate</li>
            <li> It does leave a faint white color on the skin, but that is true of all sunscreens that use physical sunblock agents.  </li>
            <li> The associate, who is African American, said that even she, with a very dark skin tone, never had a problem with a white cast, even in photographs.    </li>
            <li> I honestly wondered if I&#x27;d gotten some type of factory reject or a bottle gone bad.  </li>
            <li> I have had very irritable skin lately</li>
            <li> No thick heavy residue feeling under your makeup!</li>
            <li> She recommended SPF60, but because she&#x27;s European (I&#x27;m military overseas) wanted me to buy Anthelios by LaRoche-Posay.  </li>
            <li> So, it all works out in the long run.  </li>
            <li> This took a while since a dime-sized amount goes a really long way, which helps justify the cost in my mind.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my face in the morning and spent 3 hours outside at a carnival.</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was using a lower SPF for a long time then a dermatologist recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Thin &amp; easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I mean it really does.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with it for some time, but now knowing the UVA rating bugged to a point that last year I purchased about 5 different sunscreens from Europe with incredible UVA/UVB rating....which unfortunately broke me out really badly......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Anthelios Fluide Extreme for Face, purchased from a European pharmacy.    </li>
            <li> same as other Skinceuticals products evaluated.</li>
            <li> Then I apply the sunscreen and allow it to dry before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It actually tones down some of the red in my face (if you have a darker skin tone it may look a little white) and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosecea or give me acne.  </li>
            <li> And I mean highly.  </li>
            <li> Like Skinceuticals, a little goes a long way and thorough shaking is necessary before application.</li>
            <li> As stated above, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> If yu used Skinceutials in the past and were not wild about it - don&#x27;t let that cloud your opinion - they have made MAJOR improvements and this is one of them</li>
            <li> Now i have less acne and removed acne creams almost entirely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the slight white cast</li>
            <li> A little powder of your skintone will fix the slight white back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t do: run down my skin when I sweat and make me look like a melted candle, gunk up in creases in my skin (just a tiny bit in neck lines after a while), sting my eyes, cake up in the container opening, come off if I splash my face with water, leave a greasy or heavy matte white coat on my face.</li>
            <li> I first saw it, I was worried because I&#x27;m used to seeing big bottles, but the consistency is very thin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very thin and runny, blends in quickly and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> She told me to only put a little in my hand because it has zinc in it.</li>
            <li> I have found that mixing in a little bit of Nars illuminator in laguna makes me look human again.</li>
            <li> I also mix in the tiniest, itty bittiest touch (literally a touch) of Kevin Aucoin sensual skin enhancer when I want a little extra coverage</li>
            <li> I like this product but the reason i gave only two stars was because the inside cap had a defect so whenever i tilt the bottle to use, the liquid leaks little bit.</li>
            <li> It necessary just a little amount to protect all face.</li>
            <li> Its kinda expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, this sunscreen is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> but the tint provides minimal color to your face.</li>
            <li> so I use it under my eyes, just being careful to not get it in my eye.</li>
            <li> It is nothing else that a WHITE (like the ancient sunscreen) cream that leaves a thick white film on the face and that burns if by accident it gets into the eyes.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has no smell and isn&#x27;t a sticky white mess on your face!  </li>
            <li> The only caveat is that the product tends to leave a slight whitish cast on the skin--fine for me, though it might make darker skin look a little kabuki.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way -</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is non-greasy and stays put and doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes like those other greasy sunscreens for your face.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted me through the summer as you only need a small bit at a time.   </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, but once I tried it I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give my skin any glow or anything that other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and tried other sunscreens before buying this again.</li>
            <li> That was a big messy!</li>
            <li> In short order I would always turn into an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> It mixes well with other products (liquid makeup, moisturizer, etc).  </li>
            <li> I apply that all over my face and neck, I skip the eye area, but even so, no irritation at all or burning sensation to my eyes, it isn&#x27;t greasy, no white color left behind, it disapear once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t teun white.  </li>
            <li> the Elta is my fav of alllll I&#x27;ve tried, but I cannot wear it at the beach because it is too irritating to my sensitive, acneic skin.</li>
            <li> The zinc helps to even out my skin tone and make my dark spots less visible under makeup as a primer or alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other uv defense products without any luck.</li>
            <li> Finally the medical aesthetician who does my laser treatments recommended this, but it was really expensive at her office, so I searched it out on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Skinceuticals Sport UV Defense SPF 45 for years and wanted something that protected me as well but was less greasy and didn&#x27;t leave my face with a pasty white-ish look.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the LaRoche-Posay sunscreen contains avobenzone, to which I&#x27;m highly allergic.  </li>
            <li> , it states that is for all type of skin, but it&#x27;s not true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cool with a ghost look 😣</li>
            <li> After using it, the other sunscreens I try feel harsh and heavy.</li>
            <li> The other surprise was the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> and sweat-proof in ordinary activities, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried that claim to be so, including so-called sport sunscreens.</li>
            <li> little goes a LOOONNNNGG way!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> little dabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know, physical sunscreens (zinc, titanium dioxide) are much less irritating to skin than chemical sunscreens (avobenzone, oxtinioxate, homosalate, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not sure what active ingredient is causing that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not at all greasy or heavy, once it dries it feels like nothing&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> I rely heavily on the reviews on this site and others to inform and guide my decisions.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen when used everyday will prevent burns even on days you forget to use it because it builds your skins defenses against heat and sun.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for a month or so with no problems.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday for coverage and protection.</li>
            <li> It is a thin formula like the tinted Physical Fusion.</li>
            <li> I have medium oily skin and am 43 with few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m quite pale</li>
            <li> The small bottle lasts long because it goes on thin.  </li>
            <li> Chemical blocks irritate my skin beyond belief and like many of us rosecea sufferers, give me horrible acne break-outs.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar product, since 1980, but unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Besides, how much money have we all wasted buying facial sunscreens that were awful?  </li>
            <li> Seems like a small amount in the bottle</li>
            <li> I had fraxil laser repair last year leaving my face extrtemely vulnerable to sun rays.  </li>
            <li> I apply it and then put a small amount of makeup over it.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I was never able to use sunscreen on my face until I found this Skinceuticals product.  </li>
            <li> I use this, then my usual moisturizer</li>
            <li> The bottle is small</li>
            <li> I came back with lots of new dark spots and freckles so needless to say I was disappointed in the coverage.</li>
            <li> As for the smell...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all bad, or even particularly noticeable.     </li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s BAD for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I need something that works at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day because I felt like it made my makeup look thick and</li>
            <li> When riding for 6-8 hrs a day, he usually gets burned, but not with this sunscreen on his face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, spreads well on your face and doesn&#x27;t feel thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like it that all, I was disappointed to see that it painted my face white</li>
            <li> The results were disastrous--terrible sunscreen scents and thick lotion-like mixtures!  </li>
            <li> It was actually worse that Skinceuticals.    </li>
            <li> this product was not great.........</li>
            <li> However despite my skin being oilier, it still dried it out like crazy.</li>
            <li> a slight fragrance, not an unpleasant one, but not \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; either...doesn&#x27;t bother me though&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad sunscreens before but this is quite possibly one of the worst, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is in a small container which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was not so expensive...</li>
            <li> I use it onmy arm because it was too expensive to throw out.</li>
            <li> It is also quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product helps maintain the results from my expensive laser procedure.</li>
            <li> disturbing&#x27; issue is the weird industrial smell it has ...</li>
            <li> Sorry who has time for that.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, however a bottle</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a liquid, it&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly to your skin and tell where it&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li> I even use it for make-up coverage on casual days when I have errands to run.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s runny, the layer I put on is very thin</li>
            <li> It also felt greasy on my skin and made me break out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a terrible, terrible white cast.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is BAD.</li>
            <li> it was so bad.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it gave me horrible acne.</li>
            <li> so I would not look sick.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Was totally  disappointed  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with a product from skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong one!!</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off because it was just so bad!  </li>
            <li> Boy, was that painful!  </li>
            <li> My grandson hated putting sunscreen on his face and I asked him to just try this.  </li>
            <li> It, too, has a horrible odor.  </li>
            <li> Looks horrible on the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s outrageous!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this easy-to-apply sunscreen.  I has wonderful, non-irritating and non-harmful ingredients, and I will continue to reorder it.  Also, it is non-greasy and stays put and doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes like those other greasy sunscreens for your face.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that worked and did not feel greasy on my face.  This is perfect.  My skin is as smooth as can be after applying this product and not a sign of oily feel.  When it first went on it felt greasy, but that was short lived and it became smooth immediately..  I wish it was not so expensive...it takes a chunk out of my budget.</li>
            <li> Sheer coverage, a little goes a long way, it does a great job of protecting my skin, has no offensive odor, and it&#x27;s sweat resistant. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This is a very easy formula to apply.  Have used others that feel rather pasty and greasy.  This one, although greasy feeling, goes on very easily and absorbs quickly.  It does not leave your skin feeling greasy at all and it feels like you are wearing nothing at all.  Goes great with layers of face creams and makeup.  I&#x27;ve used Obagi SPF 50 and Neutrogena brand sunblocks and so far this one is my fave.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and no issue with a white residue. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First a little background on my skin: I&#x27;m 43, very fair (I always burn and never tan) and I have moderate to severe rosecea (as in VERY red).  I also have significant and permanent sun damage from not being able to find a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t severely aggravate my rosecea.  I&#x27;m currently using Retin-A to try and correct some of my existing sun damage.  So, I clearly need a heavy duty sunscreen or I have to live like a vampire.  Chemical blocks irritate my skin beyond belief and like many of us rosecea sufferers, give me horrible acne break-outs.  I tried many, many different sunscreens from the drugstore, Mary Kay, cosmetic counters, dermatologists, etc. nothing was working.  Finally the medical aesthetician who does my laser treatments recommended this, but it was really expensive at her office, so I searched it out on Amazon.  I&#x27;m now ordering my second bottle.  I love this stuff-it&#x27;s not at all greasy or heavy, once it dries it feels like nothing&#x27;s there.  It actually tones down some of the red in my face (if you have a darker skin tone it may look a little white) and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosecea or give me acne.  It also works well under make-up (I use it under Bare Minerals).  I would not say this is very water resistant, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re going to be swimming or sweating, but for daily use it&#x27;s perfect. (If you&#x27;re looking for a more water resistant physical sunscreen, I&#x27;ve used MD SolarSciences SPF 50 and it works very well, but does break me out a little).  All that being said, I haven&#x27;t been burned while using this product, but I still try to avoid being in the sun between 10 am and 4 pm (dermatologist rules).</li>
            <li> Im a big fan of Skinceuticals and I had to have this one as well. The product is gentle on my sensitive skin and it protects it in the high desert sun.</li>
            <li> GREAT sunscreen!  The matte finish really helps skin stay moist without that greasy sunscreen feeling.  My dermatologist was the one who turned me on to it, and I&#x27;m so glad I took his advise.  Won&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly and does not irritate my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen i have been used. I have oil skin, it keeps my skin dry for the whole day, wonderfull under make up.</li>
            <li> This is the best high SPF sunscreen I have ever used, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.   It blocks out both UVA and UVB rays but the formula is very lightweight so it does not cause break outs, it does not leave a white residue on the skin and it does not feel greasy.  As an added side benefit it seems to leave a subtle glow on my skin once it is absorbed (You know that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; I am talking about? It&#x27;s not shiny skin, but radiance!!!!)  This bottle lasted me through the summer as you only need a small bit at a time.   I would compare this product to La Roche Posay Anthelios which I used to use at the recommendation of my dermatologist, but this product is MUCH MUCH better.  The only slight issue I have with this sunscreen is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s nothing offensive, and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so light and liquidy, and less greasy than my daily moisturizer.  I love it, and I use it every day in the summer.  It is much more effective than the moisturizer/sunscreen combo that I had been using previously, and I have never come home at the end of the day with &#x27;surprise&#x27; redness or sunburn with this, even when I&#x27;m sure it must have worn off.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician.  I was pretty skeptical, but once I tried it I was hooked.  It is lightweight and absorbs quickly with no sticky or heavy feeling. I typically wear it under makeup, but it&#x27;s great alone too!  I used it while in the Dominican Republic and never once got burned.... even after swimming!  This stuff is great. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle...it has a nice texture.  It&#x27;s thin, spreads well on your face and doesn&#x27;t feel thick and greasy.  It works and that&#x27;s all I want!  I have that wonderful menopausal skin that wants to get brown, blotchy spots...this helps keep my skin tone even...</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but I get way better coverage using Skinceuticals SPF 30 than this product. Maybe it&#x27;s the watery consistency, I have no clue. It also leaves a flakey appearance especially under makeup. I will continue to use the Skinceuticals SPF 30 which I have used for 10 years successfully with no acne. Not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> I am an x New York model, now in my early 60&#x27;s, and I am so glad my plastic doc sells this product.  I have used a similar product, since 1980, but unfortunately it has been discontinued. I tried this product, it is smaller dose, yet more expensive.  What is this, I said?  However once I got it home I realized, that it goes much further on my skin, and it will probably equal out to about what I was spending for Ti Silc.  I tried the Ti Silc without green tea, their new product is very drying, and not at all what I expect from Ti Silc.  I am sure it will work on an oily skin, but not my Florida skin.  Try Skinceuticals sheer physical UvDefense SPF 50, it is wonderful. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good product. .... great price...</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was advised by a dermatologist that SPF 15 just wasn&#x27;t going to cut the mustard if I was going to start using retinol-based products.  She recommended SPF60, but because she&#x27;s European (I&#x27;m military overseas) wanted me to buy Anthelios by LaRoche-Posay.  Unfortunately, the LaRoche-Posay sunscreen contains avobenzone, to which I&#x27;m highly allergic.  And I mean highly.  So, I embarked upon a quest for a non-goopy, non-ooky, non-whitening zinc/titanium oxide based, high SPF sunscreen.  Boy, was that painful!  Too many times, I either felt like I had bathroom caulk on my face or looked like an extra in a vampire movie.  (The Twilight Look may be fine for a cute, chiseled, twenty-something young man but just doesn&#x27;t cut it for a 40-plus woman...)  Trolling thru Amazon, I hit upon the Skinceuticals sunscreen line, but saw no reviews for the newest, Sheer Physical Defense SPF 50.  I rely heavily on the reviews on this site and others to inform and guide my decisions.  Even with nothing to go on I figured, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s another $30 when you&#x27;ve already wasted so much money and been so frustrated?&amp;#34;  The sunscreen arrived about five days ago and I&#x27;ve worn it every day since then.  It goes on incredibly well and is absolutely weightless; within a couple of minutes you don&#x27;t even know that you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. However... It absolutely reeks. I mean it really does.  I honestly wondered if I&#x27;d gotten some type of factory reject or a bottle gone bad.  But, it doesn&#x27;t expire until 2012, and the box was completely sealed.  (And the seller is perfectly reliable.) Fortunately, after a couple of minutes the odor goes away, but initially it&#x27;s a bit of a shocker.  The other surprise was the small bottle.  But, after initially squirting out enough to cover my entire body, I realized that it&#x27;s not goopy, but liquid, so requires far less product to do the job.  (Warning:  Don&#x27;t squirt!)  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, and itlooks so good on your face that you&#x27;ll be able to get by with either nothing but blush or a light powder.  (Note:  You can use it around your eyes without any burning OR having your eyeshadow crease and your mascara run.  How many other products can claim that???) So, it all works out in the long run.  Besides, how much money have we all wasted buying facial sunscreens that were awful?  Bottom line:  THIS IS THE SUNSCREEN WE SENSITIVE SKIN FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!  And, just to ensure that I had enough on hand, I waited to write this until I placed an order for two more bottles.  ;~)   UPDATE:  13MAY2015 Because of the odor, I finally gave up on this product and switched to Clarins UV Plus Anti Pollution (tinted and nontinted).    It came hightly recommended by an associate at an American Sephora store who claimed she used it on a daily basis.   The associate, who is African American, said that even she, with a very dark skin tone, never had a problem with a white cast, even in photographs.    With that, I was sold, and have been faithfully using it for three years.    (In addition to the untinted version, I also use one of the lighter tinted shades as &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;; it provides just enough coverage.)    I love the stuff: no wierd white cast to my face, very light texture (feels much the same as the Skinceuticals), pleasant scent.      Like Skinceuticals, a little goes a long way and thorough shaking is necessary before application. Last time I was back in the States, I visited the Clarins counter at Nordstrom to purchase more.   While there, I noted that Clarins has expanded the range of tints in the UV Plus range.   Now, if one wants more coverage, folks who aren&#x27;t Caucasians can probably find something that works for them, too.  One more note regarding the Skinceuticals&#x27; odor.    I&#x27;ve also tried Anthelios Fluide Extreme for Face, purchased from a European pharmacy.    It, too, has a horrible odor.  It was actually worse that Skinceuticals.    I use it onmy arm because it was too expensive to throw out.</li>
            <li> I use this when I am out in the sun for my face, neck area.  It is in a small container which is disappointing.  I used to get it in larger containers.  It is also quite expensive.  It has good coverage and does not feel greasy and seems to last the full day.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen. No breakouts. Very light. Non greasy at all.  I put moisturizer after the spf. The first spf that does not give me breakouts. I use Neutrogina oil free moisturizer for Sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth under my BB cream. I have been using this after a medium depth peel and have had no complaints! It seems a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white greasy residue. I also wore this at the beach one day and still turned very red, so I can&#x27;t tell how well it works.</li>
            <li> What can I say...it&#x27;s gentle as all Skinceutical products are, sheer, absorbs quickly and provides great protection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a sunscreen that would fit all of my requirements - high spf, matte finish, won&#x27;t run when I sweat and work out, won&#x27;t break me out. Three years ago I started using Shiseido Spf 50 and I loved it until I found out that it&#x27;s UVA rating is very very low, despite the high SPF (read UVB) rating. That didn&#x27;t cut it for me, so I reluctantly switched to Neutrogena, which promised a higher UVA rating (although they don&#x27;t list UVA ratings in the US). I stuck with it for some time, but now knowing the UVA rating bugged to a point that last year I purchased about 5 different sunscreens from Europe with incredible UVA/UVB rating....which unfortunately broke me out really badly......While at the derm to try and take care of the newly created acne problem I was having, I came across Skinceuticals Sheer Physical Devense sunscreen and decided to give it a try, since there was nothing out there that I could possibly use. I know that physical sunscreens are superior to their chemical counterparts, but I&#x27;ve never before encountered one that wouldn&#x27;t make my face look like a mask or run it white streaks when I went to the gym and broke a sweat. Well, this sunscreen is not like other physical sunscreens: it leaves a matte finish without a white cast (at least for me, I am very fair skinned), it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it has a very high and proven UVA and UVB, and it doesn&#x27;t run as much when I am at the gym. It&#x27;s my HG sunscreen and I&#x27;m sticking with it. I hope they keep making it forever, or at least until something better comes around. But for now, I am not doing any more sunscreen experiments.</li>
            <li> thin and light tho exceptional coverage.. love the spf 50! dont use too much tho.. will be white if u do...</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample from a local spa...and immediately looked it up on Amazon when I ran out.  This took a while since a dime-sized amount goes a really long way, which helps justify the cost in my mind.  Last week before a trip I realized I was running low and tried picking up a couple of potential alternatives with other last-minute travel supplies.  The results were disastrous--terrible sunscreen scents and thick lotion-like mixtures!  Now I&#x27;m home and back to order more of this fantastic product.  Let me count the reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;-  No discernible scent (to me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;-  Extremely sheer, no ghost face action&lt;br /&gt;-  NOT oily, which is huge for this greasy monkey&lt;br /&gt;-  Have yet to be sunburnt while wearing it&lt;br /&gt;-  As stated above, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love this product! It goes on light w.o. any color and does help matte your skin. Truly fantastic</li>
            <li> Made my normally oily skin dry and flaky. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is a light as air sunscreen. I have acne... or i used to. I started wearing this under my acne solutions after the advice of an esthatician. Now i have less acne and removed acne creams almost entirely. My skin is more radiant now. The zinc helps to even out my skin tone and make my dark spots less visible under makeup as a primer or alone. I was told they have a skin colored version of this sunscreen. But i&#x27;m quite pale so i use this instead. However, it isn&#x27;t clear and will stay whitish. Most women wear at least a powder and most of us wear foundation. A little powder of your skintone will fix the slight white back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen when used everyday will prevent burns even on days you forget to use it because it builds your skins defenses against heat and sun.&lt;br /&gt;This particular screen uses the uva blocking mineral sunscreens that are non-toxic on the surface of your skin. But don&#x27;t put it on your lips. It is toxic when ingested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for a month or so with no problems.  It has finally gotten warm and sunny enough outside that I \\&quot;tested\\&quot; its effectiveness in preventing tan/sunburn.  I put this on my face in the morning and spent 3 hours outside at a carnival. Came home and noticed that I had a burn around my hairline where I had neglected to apply the sunscreen.  The rest of my face where I had applied the sunscreen was as fair as ever.    The product is a nice consistency, not thick like most sunscreens are. It does leave a faint white color on the skin, but that is true of all sunscreens that use physical sunblock agents.  It is far less noticeable than the fallene cotz sunscreen which is much thicker, more opaque and just generally gross. For areas other than my face, I use the neutrogena pure and free baby sunblock. It isn&#x27;t as nice as the skinceuticals (thicker and harder to blend), but is far less expensive and is also a physical sunblock for uva and uvb protection.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and creates physical veil of protection. Jet skied ALL day on Texas lake in August with no sunburn.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen that I can boast is light and non-greasy. I live in a tropical climate and it is good for those conditions. I even use it for make-up coverage on casual days when I have errands to run. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this sunscreen. It is weightless and natural, but I&#x27;ve realized that it doesn&#x27;t protect enough!!! My sun spots got darker, though I religiously put it on couple times a day....</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by an aesthetician.  When i told her i was using a moisturizer/sunscreen with an spf 30. She suggested I try this product because she noticed there was some build-up around my nose area and that I need a higher SPF especially because I have light red marks on my face after using accutane. She told me to only put a little in my hand because it has zinc in it. I like the product because its really light and I can tell its protecting my face because my red marks arent becoming redder and im not getting little brown freckles on my face anymore. Its kinda expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combo skin and this is the first sunscreen with a high SPF that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  Love it even if it is pricy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t give my skin any glow or anything that other products do. Wish I liked it because it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily &amp; it absorbs really quickly. I can&#x27;t say that it didn&#x27;t clog my pores but I have yet to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li> Blends quickly, pretty effective, no white streaks, not shiny, doesn&#x27;t make me look oddly purple as some sunscreens do&lt;br /&gt; - good stuff</li>
            <li> This product arrived to me in a package labeled &amp;#34;Not for Individual Sale.&amp;#34;  Which I believe means that this company is selling products they bought in bulk at a profit.  The box looked old and beat up, and though the bottle was full, I will buy my sunblock from Skinceuticals directly.  I ordered it from Amazon to save money on shipping, but felt like I might be getting a product that was either old or inferior from this seller.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask or leave your face greasy.  If you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s+ you still have to use moisturizer.  This doesn&#x27;t include moisturizers.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish on my oily face, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I totally recommend this.  : )</li>
            <li> It is excellent, It is sheer, absorbs quickly, and leaves your face perfect for the next step, your makeup. I had read about it in a magazine and now I just love it, in the hot weather.</li>
            <li> I make my own skin serum that I use daily as a moisturizer and for skin and cell repair - the only thing my serum is missing is sunscreen - I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a product that mixes well with natural and unrefined oils, until I found the Skinceuticals line.  I wonder if the SPF and UV defense is any good as I do notice my dark spots still getting darker so I need to investigate that and continue looking for good product.</li>
            <li> After trying many non-chemical sunscreens, I&#x27;ve settled on this one. What it doesn&#x27;t do: run down my skin when I sweat and make me look like a melted candle, gunk up in creases in my skin (just a tiny bit in neck lines after a while), sting my eyes, cake up in the container opening, come off if I splash my face with water, leave a greasy or heavy matte white coat on my face. It seems to be truly water- and sweat-proof in ordinary activities, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried that claim to be so, including so-called sport sunscreens. I like how light it is, it spreads easily and dries virtually sheer, and other creams and make-up layer well over it. It&#x27;s pricy so I only use it on my face and neck and use cheap stuff on my hands and the rest of me.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product from Skinceuticals, I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews about their products, well I was looking for a good sunscreen, at my job I expend time indoors as an outdoors as well. When this product arrived to my door and I looked at it, my first impression was \\&quot;what a small bottle\\&quot; but the time was passing by and a little goes a long way, believe me a small bottle like this last forever, what I always do is to don&#x27;t press the bottle too much, the product is liquid so it will comes out quickly. I apply that all over my face and neck, I skip the eye area, but even so, no irritation at all or burning sensation to my eyes, it isn&#x27;t greasy, no white color left behind, it disapear once it&#x27;s apply, I am very sensitive to strong smells, it&#x27;s smell is not strong, I&#x27;d say instead doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all!. Very good product, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen because my dermatologist promised me that I would not break out from it. For me and my acne prone skin this product was not great.........it went on a bit chalky and when I sweat it came back out of my skin in a white milky substance. It also felt greasy on my skin and made me break out like crazy.  However, I do like to use this product on my hands and arms as it does provide great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that works for my acne skin is Elta MD Clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this because it does not feel greasy and it works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Goes on easily, does not turn you white and does a great job of sun protection.  Seems like a small amount in the bottle but it goes a long way.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had fraxil laser repair last year leaving my face extrtemely vulnerable to sun rays.  I am an avid outdoor person and need every barrier I can use to protect my sentive skin to sun.  This product helps maintain the results from my expensive laser procedure.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a terrible, terrible white cast. I have a medium brown skin tone and this leaves me looking like a ghost quite frankly. I&#x27;ve had bad sunscreens before but this is quite possibly one of the worst, especially for the price. I wish I hadn&#x27;t assumed that sheer meant sheer....</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is perfect.  The small bottle lasts long because it goes on thin.  I wear under my makeup.  You will be impressed with this formula.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, invisible, very protective. I have sensitive skin and I do not react to this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and need a serious everyday sunscreen without chemicals I&#x27;d prefer to avoid. This product fits the bill. My skin tends to be oily, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is a plus. As for the smell...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all bad, or even particularly noticeable.     The only caveat is that the product tends to leave a slight whitish cast on the skin--fine for me, though it might make darker skin look a little kabuki.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the slight white cast this stuff left on my face. I had read such good things about it, but in the end it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen for my face and found this here on Amazon.  After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would give it a try.  I am really glad I did.  It goes on very smooth and does not feel like you have \\&quot;one more thing on your face\\&quot; for the day.  A little bit goes a long way.  I am very fair skinned and it did leave a white cast (someone else mentioned the same thing) but when you put on the rest of your makeup- it&#x27;s not noticeable at all.  It also leaves a matte finish as well which I really like.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good sunscreen product for their face!</li>
            <li> Awesome sunscreen, recommended to me by my dermatologist.  Been wearing it for a couple of years, love it!</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong one!! I love the sheer fluid with tint. This is good but must be rubbed in well or leaves a visible white tint. Can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;m out so I can get my normal skinceuticals sunblock.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy. Easy to apply</li>
            <li> The best block I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m a sunblock junkie and I have tried MANY brands, from the store brands like Neutrogena to the super high-end brands that I can only buy at my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  Of all that I&#x27;ve tried, THIS is my favorite. It has the zinc oxide physical block that my doctor recommends, but at the same time it is incredibly sheer and blends quickly. It is slightly tinted, which is nice.  It is pricier than Neutrogena to be sure, but it is WORTH it. The physical block ingredients are the best.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to so many great reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, but I do like how light the texture is and the slight sheen it leaves on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Make up seems to go on better and I like the feel of it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Only &#x27;disturbing&#x27; issue is the weird industrial smell it has ...</li>
            <li> Any little sun exposure and my face is full of dark pigment spots. This product helps me control my pigmentation problem when I&#x27;m outdoors.</li>
            <li> I had read marvelous comments about this sunscreen but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with it. It is nothing else that a WHITE (like the ancient sunscreen) cream that leaves a thick white film on the face and that burns if by accident it gets into the eyes. Does not look natural at all and I did not like the sensation. I think that today&#x27;s creams, like many BB or CC, DD offer a better protection  and sensation.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smooth.  However, the directions say to apply every two hours.  How can I apply every two hours once I&#x27;ve applied makeup??!!  I can only use this product in certain situations if that is the case.  So I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I was using a lower SPF for a long time then a dermatologist recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;My skin quality improved. I recommend this when in the hot summer sun.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to Clarins spf40 for the face. Both have a very light texture and are great for people with allergies. The nice thing about this product though is that it is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, does not leave excessive white cast (a little at first but quickly fades), has not clogged my pores, which is often a problem for me with skin products. I always do a two step face wash at the end of the day (an oil based product to remove makeup, then another gentle cleanser following that), and it seems to come off fine.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I took a sample and applied every day on my honeymoon in Thailand.  I came back with lots of new dark spots and freckles so needless to say I was disappointed in the coverage. To make matters worse, it gave me horrible acne. I originally chalked this up to the hot, humid weather in Thailand but I tried again when I was back in The States and my skin was clear only to get a new crop of blemishes. I would not recommend this if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is such an improvement over the old Skinceuticals facial sunscreen.  It goes on easily and blends in easily and yet still works!</li>
            <li> Was totally  disappointed  thought I was purchasing  full size item for that price, turns out travel size, buyer  beware look at vol. Not picture!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and recommend to my clients this daily product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice weight, not heavy or greasy. A little goes a long way - so, if you&#x27;re hesitant because of the cost, my bottle has lasted me approx 6-8 months. I mix with my daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this several times and purchased this product for a friend who takes motorcycle trips to AZ &amp; FL. When riding for 6-8 hrs a day, he usually gets burned, but not with this sunscreen on his face!</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen. I have acne prone skin and it has not made me break out. However it does not blend easy and is very white which is expected from a sunscreen offering such high protection.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is BAD. Yesterday after lunch I was standing outside for 15 min, my left side of the face was in the sun and I got sunburned. When I got home I read on the bottle that you need to apply this sunscreen every 2 hours. Sorry who has time for that. I need something that works at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Up until now I have had difficulty finding a sunscreen that truly blocks the rays. This one does the trick! It is lightweight and easy to use u der makeup or on its own. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years. Very, very effective. Recommended by my physician.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen ever.  I use it daily. Very gentle, non-greasy, and after months of use I have had no adverse skin reactions to the ingredients even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Am always on the lookout for a chemical free sunblock as my eyes are very sensitive to anything but.  This one fits the bill in that regard.  Seems to provide very sufficient, protective coverage in a extremely thin emulsion that&#x27;s easy to apply.  Was holding out hope it wouldn&#x27;t leave me looking like ghost.  Have to say, not quite as ghostly as some others I&#x27;ve tried, but . . . ghostly nevertheless.  I&#x27;ll probably just use this one when I&#x27;m working out in my garden and not worried so much about my appearance.  For that purpose, it should do just fine.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, this sunscreen is totally worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t require much to cover the entire face and neck and has titanium dioxide, which helps control breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for really good sun protection</li>
            <li> Elta Physical sunscreen is much better. For the money, this leaves way too much of a white cast. I&#x27;ll go back to Elta.</li>
            <li> Great but a bit pricey for the amount you get</li>
            <li> Great product for the face and neck, I&#x27;ve been appliying daily under makeup with no issues at all, love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause a breakout.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and I had almost given up.  For those of you with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and tried other sunscreens before buying this again. This product is the best for my darker complexion and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective product. However, contrary to the product claims, it does leave a white film.  It&#x27;s sheer, but it&#x27;s still a white film.  I bought this product for my husband because he didn&#x27;t like the tinted version. He said it looked like he was wearing makeup. I use the tinted version, which is very sheer but has enough of a tint to blend into your skin.  Both of us are fair-skinned.  If you have olive skin, I believe this product (and the tinted version) would be very obvious.</li>
            <li> Sheer my ass. This product made me look like a damn geisha.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting, very effective, small enough for carry on travel. I have very fair, sensitive skin and this is working great. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After trying a myriad of facial sunscreens, this one has been my favorite for several years.  It does a great job of protecting my skin without causing breakouts.  Works great on its own or paired with a BB cream or foundation.  Yes, it is expensive, however a bottle this size will usually last me 4-5 months (with daily application).  Re-application is needed after swimming, but this is the case with most facial sunscreens.  Scent free.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Has a chalky white finish. Couldn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to dryness and acne. I&#x27;ve tried a few other uv defense products without any luck. I tried a sample of this and 3 days later purchased it. I prefer the tinted UV defense because you can go out without any makeup on but the tint provides minimal color to your face. I really like the sheer feeling you get after application. Most UV products have that oily feel, but this product feels light. It is also blendable with foundation, concealer, or BB/CC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few physical sunscreens with an spf of 30 or greater and have had so much trouble finding one that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. This sunscreen is better since it has a nice tint to it, but it still makes my face very pale and has a white tint to it but it&#x27;s not terrible. I have found that mixing in a little bit of Nars illuminator in laguna makes me look human again. I also mix in the tiniest, itty bittiest touch (literally a touch) of Kevin Aucoin sensual skin enhancer when I want a little extra coverage and it looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge bonus is this sunscreen&#x27;s staying power. I do hot yoga daily and rinse my face off with water after class and this sunscreen stays on my skins even after that... I can still see it and feel it on my skin and I cleanse and see it come off when I cleanse my face (I use bioderm on a cotton pad so I know what&#x27;s coming off my face!). I&#x27;m not 100% sure if the sun protection factor is still intact after so much sweating, but since it is water resistant up to 40 minutes and I see no sun damage or burn after my 30 min walk home from yoga I&#x27;m thinking it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this sunscreen, especially since it&#x27;s a great deal and provides reliable broad spectrum sun protection through physical filters. If you don&#x27;t know, physical sunscreens (zinc, titanium dioxide) are much less irritating to skin than chemical sunscreens (avobenzone, oxtinioxate, homosalate, etc.) and have been around forever, so I feel more comfortable using this on my skin daily.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  I have had very irritable skin lately (hormones?  sensitive skin?).  This did not cause any type of burning or redness at all!  It is a fluid, which will not give as much moisture as some creams I have used.  However, since my BB cream has quite a bit of moisture, this is the perfect combo for that.  (I have fair, 30&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li> I ordered this sun screen last week. I got it yesterday. But the cap was broken,&lt;br /&gt;and the liquid came out. That was a big messy!</li>
            <li> Just spent the week in Hawaii and this product worked great as sunscreen.  Did not clog pores or create break outs.</li>
            <li> Goes on matte and sheer, just as promised!  Makes a great base for my mineral powder makeup.  And no fragrance!  Seriously love this.</li>
            <li> I like this, it&#x27;s very thin and runny, blends in quickly and is not sticky.  Having said that, it leaves your face white!!  I had to really put on a lot of bronzer to cover the Casper-like shade this left on my face( even under tinted moisturizer...)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best suncreens I&#x27;ve used. It goes on invisibly, and works really well under makeup. I actually wanted to order the tinted version, but the untinted one is just as nice.</li>
            <li> I got this when I went for a facial and love this stuff! It&#x27;s light and it has sunscreen, just great by itself in summer and easily layered in weather that makes your skin dry. Plus- came right to my door.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this facial sunscreen--it&#x27;s everything I needed: unscented, nongreasy, effective, and perfect under my moisturizer. I need to use about a nickel-size worth and gently blend in. Definitely recommend and is now one of my can&#x27;t-do-withouts.</li>
            <li> Watery, gritty and white. Will not purchase again. Looks horrible on the face. Best stuff is Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone.</li>
            <li> Better than La Roche Posay sunscreen. Feels better under make-up, and Lakota less greasy/ shininess you get from Most sunscreen.  No smell.no chalky residue, even after getting out of the water. Didn&#x27;t burn at all with this stuff! Passed the intense sun of summer in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> This really works!  It is light and blends in super easy and it&#x27;s SPF 50!!  You have to try it because once you do, you will continue to buy it in the future :)</li>
            <li> Very light weight yet effective.  I wore it skiing for an entire week and didn&#x27;t get a burn. There was lots of sun and wind, but my face stayed protected.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly without interfering with application of make up.  I highly recommend this excellent sunscreen as a part of a daily regimen.  This  product was recommended by my Dermatologist and the benefits are great.</li>
            <li> this product is the best base for makup.  Especially great for people who suffer from skin allergies. Goes on white but soaks into skin fast.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I had bought many spf&#x27;s ranging in all prices and this is by far one of the best. I actually returned cle de peau because this was better. Doesn&#x27;t have that white finish and matts out your makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> I have always been a firm believer in wearing sunscreen but really didn&#x27;t like the consistency of many of the brands I&#x27;ve used (Olay, Neutrogena, Eucerin and Philosophy).  This sunscreen is liquid instead of cream. Which I love, because it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on after applying, it does have a scent but it goes away within minutes.  I have really sensitive skin and this has worked wonders in not breaking me out. I would definitely buy this product especially if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I visit a popular skincare forum and so many people raved about this sunscreen for having good UVA protection (rare in the USA) and being &amp;#34;cosmetically elegant&amp;#34;. However despite my skin being oilier, it still dried it out like crazy. I peeled from this stuff it was so bad.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used for my face. It goes on lightly and smoothly. Provides excellent protection.</li>
            <li> I have skin thai is both sensitive and acne prone, but this product does not cause itching, stinging or breakouts. It also works well under makeup.  I apply vitamin C serum first (for added protection from sun damage).  Then I apply the sunscreen and allow it to dry before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I like this product but the reason i gave only two stars was because the inside cap had a defect so whenever i tilt the bottle to use, the liquid leaks little bit. It was a good deal in price except this problem.</li>
            <li> Chalk face vs. paper bag face??? .. Hmmmm.... You decide....  Does the job but leaves a bit of a ghostly hue... No break outs though</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it&#x27;s a skin-toned sunscreen that works for all skins. I apply it and then put a small amount of makeup over it. It does not burn or irritate so I use it under my eyes, just being careful to not get it in my eye.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very light weight. It also is not greasy and goes on easy under my makeup application. I use it everyday for coverage and protection. So glad the little girl at the spa recommended this during my facial!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist as one of the best face sun lotion.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with a product from skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> That is a  good product but It&#x27;s BAD for sensitive skin, it states that is for all type of skin, but it&#x27;s not true, I  have to return it after I use it for one time!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores which is a biggie in the 110 degree heat.</li>
            <li> I used to have Tizo3 and loved my non grease sunblock but after I didn&#x27;t find it in Amazon I ordered skinceutical and I didn&#x27;t like it that all, I was disappointed to see that it painted my face white and I believe me I&#x27;m not cool with a ghost look 😣</li>
            <li> Great face sunscreen, one of the best I have used. It is not tinted, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any whitish residues. It is matte, and very light. It is so light that I don&#x27;t feel it at all. Besides, it can be used under makeup as well. It is not scented, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Highly recommended for people with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this product was even legit.  I used it and sores broke out all over my head.  I wonder what was truly in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals! I decided to try the Sheer Physical UV Defense SPF50 after using and loving the Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF50.  I wanted a sunscreen for my chest, hands, etc or days I wanted to go without the tint. I love this for a solution. At first the Sheer appears a bit white. :/ But give it a minute and it fades to skin tone. Phew! :) Very happy with it. It is a thin formula like the tinted Physical Fusion. Product arrived in good condition, on time, unopened and authentic. Recommend seller.</li>
            <li> I was out in the sun today and had to reapply this 3 times.  It comes off very easy with perspiration.</li>
            <li> I was never able to use sunscreen on my face until I found this Skinceuticals product.  The others I tried seemed to greasy for me, and I would break out from them. Then, my aestheticism recommended this, and I have used it ever since.  It has the perfect texture and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist in Brazil recommended me this product a couple of months ago-it&#x60;s the best we have so far ,he said.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s really good indeed.It spread easily and the skin gets a soft touch,besides protection of course.&lt;br /&gt;In Brazil,the only problem is the price.It costs here 3 or 4 times  more than if you buy abroad or in Amazon.It&#x60;s outrageous!</li>
            <li> I purchase SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 online and I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;see the part about the tint. Used it several times and it looks like my face&lt;br /&gt;is dehydrated/dry. Does anyone else have this problem? Is the Sheer version&lt;br /&gt;any better? I bought the large bottle --- $64 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy!  Tinted!  Great feeling when applied to skin.  Highly recommend this product.  If yu used Skinceutials in the past and were not wild about it - don&#x27;t let that cloud your opinion - they have made MAJOR improvements and this is one of them</li>
            <li> The product was grainy, like putting salt on your face. Clearly from a faulty batch and way beyond its sell by date.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Good coverage and not sticky. It absorbs well and didn&#x27;t dry my skin. I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> This product is most like a great product like most skinceuticals products are, but it makes your skin look white. I have light olive skin and after applying this I looked fluorescent. I had just worked on a nice self tan to avoid using color moisturizer or make up, but after applying this sunscreen I had to use make up so I would not look sick.</li>
            <li> very lightweight and works the best above all other sunscreens for the face</li>
            <li> This goes on so easily and is sheer once you smooth it on.  A little goes a long way.  The nurse at the medi-spa where I have had treatments always applied this to my face afterwards and uses it herself, so that encouraged me to give it a try.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Before, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer 50 SPF.  I only used it when I knew for a fact I&#x27;d be out in the sun all day.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day because I felt like it made my makeup look thick and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this, I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t stop wearing it every day.  The greatest selling factor for me personally was how it felt on my skin.  Because it&#x27;s runny, the layer I put on is very thin and I can&#x27;t even notice or feel it.  You could even wear it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wonder what my skin would&#x27;ve been like had I worn it every day since I was 15.  This could very much be what saves your face from premature wrinkles.  You only have one face for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-50 SPF (I typically see only 15 SPF in most products)&lt;br /&gt;-very matte finish&lt;br /&gt;-thin yet highly potent even with such a small amount so I can wear under my makeup even with oily skin&lt;br /&gt;-works well for my oily and sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-when I first saw it, I was worried because I&#x27;m used to seeing big bottles, but the consistency is very thin so this bottle should last months&lt;br /&gt;-has a slight fragrance, not an unpleasant one, but not \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; either...doesn&#x27;t bother me though&lt;br /&gt;-higher cost than I&#x27;m used to was intimidating when deciding to \\&quot;pull the trigger\\&quot; but it&#x27;s far superior than anything at the drug store (or even dept stores) and worth every ounce</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Skinceuticals products and was surprised by its quality! I recommend it to anybody who can&#x27;t use sunscreens that contain chemical filters.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feel and look of this product. I have oily skin, and this sunscreen goes on so smooth - and the matte finish leaves my face looking and feeling less shiny. I bought the small size to make sure I liked it - but I am going to order a larger one and keep this one for travel.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this light formula for days when I will be out in the sun.  It does have a rather chemical smell, but it is &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34;  It also is free of parabens, which is important to me.  It applies well under makeup and does not leave a white cast to the face.  It also dries matte, unlike Josie Maran&#x27;s physical sunblock, which can leave an oily finish.</li>
            <li> We bought seven sunscreen!!!!...Totally love the way our skins feel. Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more. Very fast deliver.</li>
            <li> Altho pricey,  this sunscreen is great for the face.  It goes on very smooth and light.  I will use it sparingly but really like that it feels invisible when it&#x27;s on.  Can use lotion and or makeup over top; no problems!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great, light, oil-free feel.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LOOONNNNGG way!&lt;br /&gt;Easy application and the bottle lets you squeeze out little dabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
            <li> This is a great sun screen, SPF 50, to wear with our without make-up. You are even able to use it under your eyes without any irritation. It is light and easily applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this sunscreen. I am vey happy with it. Fairly lightweight and easy to apply. I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I have used the Skinceuticals Sport UV Defense SPF 45 for years and wanted something that protected me as well but was less greasy and didn&#x27;t leave my face with a pasty white-ish look.  This stuff goes on so amazingly well, light and not at all greasy.  It almost instantly disappears into my very dry skin areas while my very oily T-zone stays oil free!  I never thought I would find a product that could accomplish that task.  Yes, I only gave it 4 stars because the smell is a bit sour when it&#x27;s first applied, but it goes away pretty quickly.  I&#x27;ve worked out wearing this and it does not run or get greasier when I sweat and the SPF protection is great, although, like most sunscreens, it might need re-application if spending more than a few hours outdoors.  Makeup goes on great over it too, this will be my everyday sunscreen from now on.</li>
            <li> If I would have purchased directly from Skinceuticals it would have cost $44 bucks so I must say that this was a tremendous value and savings. Same product that I have grown to love and GREAT price.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It absorbs so quickly! I got it to protect my face after getting hyperpigmentation in my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;after getting laser and being in the sun. It has protected me like no other sunscreen and the spots are almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I want to keep using it forever!</li>
            <li> I like that this is not greasy at all!  But they went too far the other direction, and it is completely drying. I have medium oily skin and am 43 with few wrinkles. I think it&#x27;s because of my oily skin.  I want to protect against sun, and some cremes are too oily, it will be nice to find the right balance. This one is parching though.</li>
            <li> This product is nongreasy and can be worn under makeup.  I have SUPER oily skin and prior to using this product I had tried tons of products and nothing worked. In short order I would always turn into an oil slick.  In addition, my skin is really sensitive and almost every product irritated my face.  This product did NOT irritate my face or my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily sensitive skin you will love this product.</li>
            <li> it works good , but first time i got it tinted. this one is white and it does not look as good as tinted one. well, there is no sign that says it&#x27;s regular or so... I tried to look for tinted one ., but there is no one ?</li>
            <li> A tad costly but well worth it. It goes on like a silk like powder, very light and doesn&#x27;t feel thick under your makeup.  I have very sensitive skin and this was recommended by my dermatologist. My daughter is hooked on it now as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens. This one is the best one so far. This sunscreen is not greasy, lasts all day, and one small bottle lasts at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but it works.  Leaves a white tint.  I mix it with a broker that also has SPF.</li>
            <li> same as other Skinceuticals products evaluated.</li>
            <li> Most sun screens I&#x27;ve tried (many) make my eyes burn and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma once, I really needed to find one I could wear.  Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to get this- not only is it a great sunscreen, it really makes my skin look better when I wear it.  Not white and pasty- just much more even.  I will definately try the tinted version next time!  Also, seemed pricey when I got it, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face.  I think it&#x27;s a good value for the science you are getting. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like silk, it does have a tiny bit of white fr the sink but it goes away right away and you can wear it with makeup</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, just too pricey for the size of the bottle you get.</li>
            <li> I have always had skin allergies, but Skinceuticals was recommended to me by my dermatoligist and I have used it for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li> Sinceuticals Sheer Physical Uv Defense is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased;  although somewhat pricey, I think it does wonders for your complexion.  I really like the fact that it is light, airy and non-sticky;</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen. It&#x27;s light and makes your skin glow. It can be used as an under make up brightener because it&#x27;s smoothens your skin&#x27;s texture which makes you look flawless.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  It is lightweight and not greasy.  Caution, however, it squirts out quickly because consistency is like water.&lt;br /&gt;Shake before, like a cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals Sheer Plysical UV defense SPF 50 is ideal for sun protection!  It goes on smooth and not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this a hand full of times and it works good and light weight.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Plus it&#x27;s broad spectrum which is highly recommend by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I switched from the LaRoche product because it was burning my eyes and I wanted a sunscreen that was zinc based and not as toxic.  This sunscreen works very well but it smells like rancid food when it first comes out of the bottle and is spread on the face.  It always catches me off guard because I am trying to figure out where the smell is coming from.  It does go away after a minute of two.  Not sure what active ingredient is causing that but there is definitely some room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I love all the product details, but this product clogged my pores and I started getting little blackheads. I love how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock I have combination skin and it works really good it does not leave the skin feeling oily or shiny</li>
            <li> I love this product. No thick heavy residue feeling under your makeup!</li>
            <li> Great daily sunscreen. Thin &amp; easily absorbed. This was recommended by my plastic surgeon after laser resurfacing &amp; I&#x27;ve used it ever since. I use this, then my usual moisturizer</li>
            <li> My recent purchase of this sunscreen smells so foul!  I have used this sunscreen before and loved it.  In fact, I have some left and it barely has a scent.  I ordered this new bottle on Dec. 4, 2012 and just used it the other day, and the scent just knocked me over.  I had to wash it off because it was just so bad!  Did they change the formula?</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I love the sheer application and that it protects your skin from the damaging rays of the sun.  It&#x27;s a must have for skin care!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this is the best product I have found so far.  It is sheer and light.  I have re-ordered several times.</li>
            <li> My mistake: I thought this was the one with the tint.  It works great as a sunscreen, but what I was looking for was the tinted sunscreen.  Woops!</li>
            <li> Slightly burns at first, but I think it is very good. I can only use zinc oxide, which this has as its sunscreen. Very sheer, feels light on face. Does not break out face!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sun block for about 2 months, at the request of my dermatologist. Since it&#x27;s winter and I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun very much, I don&#x27;t know how well it protects against the sun. I do know that it goes on very light and dry, not greasy at all. It also has no odor. My wife uses it daily under her make-up and loves it. The only drawback is its price (in the $30/bottle range), otherwise I would give it 5 stars, assuming it protects well against the sun.</li>
            <li> Arrived already expired.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me, a melanoma patient.  I love that it goes on smoothly and that I easily can use make-up over it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. This sunscreen is so light that it can be worn under make up without causing a pasty feeling. Glides on and last all day. I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wanted the liquid suncreen which is skin color.  Instead I recieved the cream suncreen.  Definitely not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen worked great on my recent vacation, I came home with no sunburn!  The bottle is small so it fits nicely in your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> I was referred this product by friend who&#x27;s dermatologist said it was very good. So I ordered it so far so good</li>
            <li> I love skinceuticals SPF.  I used to use Physical Defense SPF 30 because it was the best out there, but I thought it was too thick.  This is just as good for protection, but my skin feels silky and smooth after applying it.  It&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t teun white.  I use it everyday.  I also bought one for my mother who also loves it!  This is my go to now and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of [[ASIN:B000NCA7NU Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 - Skin Ceuticals - Day Care - 90ml/3oz]] for years and decided to try this one instead, I don&#x27;t like it as much. Because it&#x27;s a liquid, it&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly to your skin and tell where it&#x27;s going. Also, throughout the course of the day, I noticed my skin was not any less oily than it normally is with the other Skinceuticals Ultimate sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this sunscreen provides no benefit over my prior Skinceuticals sunscreen. When it runs out, I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
            <li> I love this...very light!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she said it&#x27;s was worth every dollar spent on it. It necessary just a little amount to protect all face. It&#x27;s not greasy and makes the skin smooth. Many people said it leaves the skin white, but it is just a matter finding de right amount. She would by it again.</li>
            <li> Better than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and has a weightless feel.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has no smell and isn&#x27;t a sticky white mess on your face!  A sunscreen miracle!!!  I almost had given up wearing sunscreen because of how greasy my skin looked with it on until I tried Skinceuticals.  It mixes well with other products (liquid makeup, moisturizer, etc).  Also, the company makes a tinted sunscreen that is similar for those that may want that.</li>
            <li> My grandson hated putting sunscreen on his face and I asked him to just try this.  he liked it - no fuss anymore!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says there is nothing better than it. It feels light and it is highly potent as well. After using it, the other sunscreens I try feel harsh and heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell but it is thin and does dry clear, therefore, applying makeup on top of it works fine.  I prefer Elta.</li>
            <li> great product IF I don&#x27;t use it over my Duac topical prescribed by my derm. the Duac makes it ball up horrifically.  feels awesome on- so light and airy and not at all greasy, but there is a slight white cast that becomes more noticeable throughout the day.  I went back to my Elta MD clear (never a white cast, but not a physical sunblock, either) for every day, but I will def try this out at the beach next month.  the Elta is my fav of alllll I&#x27;ve tried, but I cannot wear it at the beach because it is too irritating to my sensitive, acneic skin.</li>
