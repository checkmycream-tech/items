            <li>Makes a great emergency cream too.</li>
            <li>This cuticle cream does a great job at moisturizing and KEEPING them that way for a while.</li>
            <li>This is a great item to carry with you and have at home.  </li>

            <li>It smells great, is not greasy, and the compact is very handy.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I just know that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes good products, and this smells great, so I use</li>
            <li>I love the wonderful lemony scent as well.  </li>
            <li>This product is seriously my favorite it works great!</li>
            <li>I put this on every night before bed to keep my cuticles nice and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It seems to work to moisturize and it is pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and has a great price as well.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful but light lemon scent, not overpowering.</li>

            <li>It just seems to freshen up my day when I use it, and helps keep my hands and fingers in good condition so that I feel good and can keep my customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it&#x27;s good stuff and a couple of bucks won&#x27;t kill me --</li>
            <li>I forgot how much I loved this product.</li>
            <li>And I put a GOOD amount on.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff for keeping those cuticles in good shape</li>
            <li>It has a good scent -- not all girly, so it&#x27;s good for guys (like me) who wash their hands often and gals who like the lemony freshness.</li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, works for us.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and nourishes the cuticles.</li>
            <li>Provides good protection&lt;</li>
            <li>It feels waxy, kind of like Chapstick, but in a pleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted something specifically for cuticles, although I had been using Suave vitamin E body lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li>Flavor was okay, but not the best - there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just fresh, citrus-y, and delicious.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>it will make your nails and cuticle look healthy and beautiful and clean absolutely great product</li>

            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I have and would recommend this product to anyone looking for healthy nails!</li>
            <li>My favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees product!</li>
            <li>I love this cuticle cream!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.      </li>
            <li>This creme is amazing, I put this on after I put on my hand lotion and massage them in</li>
            <li>The lemon oil makes it smell absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works wonders for my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Made a huge difference keeping my cuticles hydrated and smells great.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, soaks into nail bed nicely.</li>
            <li>but now they&#x27;re growing out nicely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually so nice that I don&#x27;t even want to polish them.</li>
            <li>I really liked the lemon butter creme.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to spend the $30 for Dior because its the best or  if you want fast results.</li>
            <li>: moisturizes my cuticles well, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>They even look nice after I&#x27;ve washed my hands and without lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this is good for your cuticles (i noticed a difference when I used it- better moisturized cuticles than just lotion)</li>
            <li>I loved how smooth my hands are now!</li>
            <li>This product is effective and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>If I go even 2-3 days without some kind of moisture on my hands</li>
            <li>I need to either rub the excess around like a hand cream or kind of wipe it off when I&#x27;m done otherwise</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant -not too strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on around cuticles easily, smells good.</li>
            <li>Would use it more often if it would rub in better!</li>
            <li>and I am so proud of how my hands look for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li>Burts Bees rocks, I love how this has softened my cuticles and keeps them from catching and splitting</li>
            <li>It is, as far as I can tell, perfect.</li>
            <li>It would work as lip balm better than cuticle cream to be honest.  </li>
            <li>This cuticle cream is incredibly helpful and is very guy</li>
            <li>but this is very light and not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>This product is very light and not greasy, so you can wear it throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Nice product and easily applied.</li>
            <li>This cuticle cream is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>Immediately my skin felt better, and within a week, my hands looked better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li>I love Burts, and this gets added to my list of favorites.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t make them any better by picking at them either.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic P:)</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It works and I like the smell, the reason for four stars, is it says its a cream, but its more like a Balm, so it sits on top of the skin more&lt;</li>
            <li>more waxy---</li>
            <li>I think that this is one product that women, men, and children will love.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>THANK GOODNESS for this magical cream.</li>
            <li>(This ties as my favorite of the line with the Peppermint Soap.)</li>
            <li>I use it mostly to moisturizer my nails</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is simply THE best cuticle cream I have ever tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting way better results than 2 weeks using this.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, it makes my cuticles and nails appear healthy...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>br /&gt;The creme, as others noted, is more of a wax (think lip balm for your cuticles).</li>
            <li>I worked in the printing industry then many years as a janitor.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>it just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; while dryness is removed and my nails look healthy between manicures.</li>
            <li>Love all Burt&#x27;s bees products</li>
            <li>but, still, most of us would prefer not paying more</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think the smell is my favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This keeps my cuticles in check :-)</li>
            <li>It is more of a balm (like chapstick texture) than creme</li>
            <li>Also love the exfoliation I get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of lemons, love lemony smell of products.</li>
            <li>I so love the scent of the cuticle cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>I use this product every day and have been using it for many months.  </li>
            <li>Using this product makes the nails look \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would package this product in more of a chapstick type applicator</li>
            <li>And the smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>Love this cuticle cream.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this cuticle cream -</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, light lemony fragrance that is yummy, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on things like oily/greasy products do.  </li>
            <li>First off, this stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lovely and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I think this is more suited as a maintenance treatment for cuticles than it is for helping remove frayed or overgrown cuticles.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>so you could more easily target just the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very soft, and it is great for both fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it does smell nice but it really hasn&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is a company that uses great quality natural and health-promoting ingredients, too.</li>
            <li>I was hooked and if you buy this cream and a lip balm product you will be amazed at how much more comfortable summer and winter can be.</li>
            <li>Love this cuticle butter so much!!!</li>
            <li>First off, love the scent!  </li>
            <li>Nice lemon scent, not too strong, and rich cream that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply in bed and not get it</li>
            <li>It smells great, absorbs quick, and it keeps your cuticles and nails soft and moisturized even through hand-washing!</li>
            <li>Im using it along w/ OPI avoplex cuticle and works just fine.</li>
            <li>However, the word &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is not quite accurate...</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall really happy with the product and am on my 3rd tin already-</li>
            <li>Nothing like the chemically lemon scent a lot of products have, this one genuinely smells like the fruit</li>
            <li>so I thought this would help, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Anyway so far so good</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves the cuticles a little greasy, but not bad, and it works great!</li>
            <li>The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff make your nails look healthier with moisterized cuticles, but boy does it smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I found this item not only to have a light citric fresh scent but to work great on moisturizing my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and look so much more healthy even after coming out of the pool.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a more positive review for this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh lemony smell and my cuticles not only look better about after 2 weeks of use, but it has also helped stop my nail biting habit!</li>
            <li>/&gt;J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Burt&#x27;s Bees Enthusiast</li>
            <li>My manicurist couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked (and in only ONE DAY!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Contains, Sweet almond oil ~ beeswax ~ lemon oil ~</li>
            <li>to the consistency, I would really call this more of a balm than a creme.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll last a good 24 hours if not longer.</li>
            <li>Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.   </li>
            <li>This stuff makes such a huge difference and keeps my nails and cuticles looking and feeling hydrated and healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite thing out of the entire \\&quot;healthy hands\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Waxy nature keeps the balm on my cuticles unlike creams that vanish so quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this and use it without lucky.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent cuticle cream that works.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF, highly recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bees products are legendary and while this would normally get 5 stars in relation to competing products, Burt&#x27;s has set the expectation bar high and as a result slips in at 4 stars based on the cons I listed above.</li>
            <li>I have had much better success with either using an oil or a cream called Healthy Hoof that I bought in a drugstore for $3.99 which contains almost double the amount as in the Burt&#x27;s Bees cream.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my nails strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>It will be at first of course!</li>
            <li>The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees has such a wonderful line of products; wish I had the time and $$ to try every single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried other cuticle creams, but they are all more suitable for nighttime when it doesn&#x27;t matter if youre fingers are greaasy.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles look and feel great while using this, though it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product that I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, but if you need something heavy duty, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>and after it&#x27;s fully absorbed my cuticles feel alleviated and soft.</li>
            <li>Being a fan of lemons, I love the soft lemony smell of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m enjoying the results so far.</li>
            <li>and painting my nails frequently and removing them with acetone isn&#x27;t the most nourishing thing either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, and is much cheaper than lemony flutter and they are basically the same thing.</li>
            <li>This is particularly useful for people like me who don&#x27;t paint fingernails.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t fun when I ruined my freshly styled hair when I ran my hands through it a while after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a greasy feeling, but it drys up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s one of the reasons we read these reviews, right?</li>
            <li>I use it at night right before bed.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am super happy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>This more or less , I think there are better at lower prices.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this is better or worse at that, but it does smell and feel pleasant.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of this and it does not have a strong greasy feeling like other products do.  </li>
            <li>I put the hand salve on first.</li>
            <li>In conjunction, I take vitamins, take extra folic acid and biotin, I eve apply castor oil on my cuticles to maintain my fingernails and cuticles healthy.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever went to get a manicure, the aesthetician was taken aback: &amp;#34;You&#x27;re cuticles are perfect,&amp;#34; she said with incredulity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped getting manicures because I don&#x27;t believe a man&#x27;s hands should be overly pretty.</li>
            <li>It  works pretty well, too.</li>
            <li>This cuticle cream does absolutely nothing for my cuticles and doesn&#x27;t nourish my nails one bit!  </li>
            <li>My top lip always gets red and chapped during the winter time.</li>
            <li>I was a cosmetologist in my younger years and have tried many cuticle products.</li>
            <li>I started to use this product when I lived in Seattle, WA and it was one of the first Burt&#x27;s Bees products I ever found.</li>
            <li>Many of the products have multiple uses and</li>
            <li>and it really does seem to help!</li>
            <li>Never thought this cr√®me cures my running skin(the top skin next to your cuticle tears along a side of your nails) after every cuticle cut.  </li>
            <li>Butter is such an appropriate name for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately unless I said \\&quot;this is the best company ever...</li>
            <li>Well... honestly at first what do you expect in a lotion/cream?</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a week, but I am in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gardener, and my  hand get pretty beat up sometimes.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it since it works better than the last cuticle product I used.</li>
            <li>It also stays put pretty much, I use it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I had very dry cuticles, instantly my cuticles looked great.</li>
            <li>I also love how it smells nice and lemony but not too strong or artificial.</li>
            <li>The smell is great but subtle.</li>
            <li>I have to use something much stronger such as Kerasal even on the nails and cuticles, it works much better.</li>
            <li>Love this cuticle cream and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Massaging this into them has helped them so much and they are much softer now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural sweet lemon scent, not cloying or fake-smelling.</li>
            <li>I feel like my cuticles are super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>my nails and fingers look 100X better, not all dry.  </li>
            <li>It sort of looks like there is a &#x27;clear coat&#x27; on yours nails after using this product from the very first day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you apply it at least 5 times a day!</li>
            <li>However, I paid nearly eight dollars, having become lazy and assuming the price on Amazon would be as good or better than any only to discover that I could have gotten it from Ulta or Beauty.com for under six.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hands from to many years with drying chemicals.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for my cuticles.</li>
            <li>It smells VERY lemony...</li>
            <li>This is a product that works very well.</li>
            <li>It does not make that much difference regarding the condition of my cuticles, however.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my cracked nails and flaky cuticles.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely use it every time I see it.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>My nails seem very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I really could not wait to tell anyone about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion it absorbs fast though so it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>It just takes a couple minutes and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>The Suave lotion is much cheaper and easier to use, but it also leaves my hands feeling greasier than this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind, and it moisturizes great  </li>
            <li>It conditions the cuticles, moisturizes the skin around your nail bed and really does work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I do wish that I didn&#x27;t have to use it quite so often, but that is really my fault because of all the yard/house work I&#x27;ve been doing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so great if you want to remove thick cuticles completely.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it, but it just does not make that much difference in the shape of my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances &amp; often find that I can&#x27;t use certain products because of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second tin of cuticle creme and it is the second of many.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a particularly longer and colder winter in Chicago this season and the weather was beginning to do a number on my cuticles and hands.</li>
            <li>Now, for me personally my cuticles weren&#x27;t super gnarly or anything</li>
            <li>This stuff is decent, it does moisturize your cuticles.</li>
            <li>My cuticles are very soft and don&#x27;t crack as much after using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for your cuticles.</li>
            <li>Highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff because it&#x27;s organic and Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t test on animals.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very waxy, smells nice, and helps heal torn, sad cuticles quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I smear a little bit of this stuff on top, and within an hours time, the redness is gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect that from anything a little more heavy-duty, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would definitely not be something you&#x27;d want to leave in the car on a hot day!</li>
            <li>A little of this stuff goes a long way which is good too.</li>
            <li>It gentle and soft in your cuticle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally gravitate towards a lemon scent</li>
            <li>My nails felt better after a few days.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, so I use it liberally as needed... and maybe even when not really needed since it smells so lemony fresh!</li>
            <li>I had heard a friend say that she can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is one amazing product.</li>
            <li>I put it on before going to sleep and wake up in the morning with soft, perfect cuticles - it also helps with hangnails and those painful splits in the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Sure the ingredient list is &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, however you can save your few dollars and just buy any natural oil and your nails will look shiny and be nourished for hoursss.</li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast into your skin.</li>
            <li>I have used everything under the sun for my cracking skin near my nails, and nothing works like this!</li>
            <li>But apparently if I keep using this creme, I don&#x27;t really need manicures anyway.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>(I applied everyday on all 10 fingers for last 3 weeks, and at this speed I can use this whole thing for 4-6 more months)&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>In 2 days my cuticles were soft and stopped cracking!</li>
            <li>Be careful because if you suffer from a nut allergy this has sweet almond oil in it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it can be a bit messy and oily for a bit until my skin fully absorbs it but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li>Worth a try if you have dry, cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn&#x27;t rich enough.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m in the clear.</li>
            <li>Apply on cuticles, and they will appear soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>ingredients are all natural too, which is an added plus.</li>
            <li>For a professional guy, this will keep your hands looking like gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a creme should rub in completely, and this does not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the greasy complaints I&#x27;ve seen about this product?</li>
            <li>Professional manicures just never made my list of priorities.  </li>
            <li>My nails look neater and cleaner since using this, and my hands feel really soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons.</li>
            <li>The lemon-colored cream smells like fresh lemon, and the texture is harder than Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with some of my cuticles, particularly on the fingers that are affected mostly by mild nail psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I love how thick the cream is yet not greasy.</li>
            <li>EVER!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used several much more expensive, even special oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good is your cuticles aren&#x27;t too bad off .</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon in the past, I&#x27;ve also noticed this product at both Target and Walgreens for about the same price that may be more convenient to pick up vs. ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cuticles went from being in really bad shape (dry, cracked, split) to perfect after using this for just 2 nights.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>my cuticles are finally looking normal again after using this product for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>My cuticles are quickly back to normal (within a day or two)</li>
            <li>I work with my hands a lot and tend to have dry and fraying cuticles/eponychium (the skin right above your cuticle).</li>
            <li>I ordered a few more directly from Amazon.com to leave in my desk and other parts of the house.</li>
            <li>which is much different from my other cuticle oil that only took a bit of rubbing to get my free hanging cuticle off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry cuticles and set out to find a cuticle cream that would really work (lots of products claim to but don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also put it on dry knuckles before bed, and by morning they are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the lemon smell and the thick cream that instantly enhances my cuticle</li>
            <li>I had a major reaction from this.</li>
            <li>I have  used most every product in the drugstore to soften and heal my cracked and tough cuticles, but none of them had the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use much each time, so the box will last long.</li>
            <li>Instantly makes your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>but it never really changed much.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with dry cuticles and this not only prevents that</li>
            <li>so they do not dry out and cause problems.</li>
            <li>and he really hates conventional beauty products.</li>
            <li>Then my nails are back to normal again, dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m washing my hands and sanitizing several times a day (we&#x27;re barely pass flu season).</li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming or too powerful.</li>
            <li>I have brittle nails and very dry cuticles even though I live in humid Florida.</li>
            <li>It keeps your cuticules soft and they never look dry.</li>
            <li>Took about a week of daily use to clear up hangnails &amp; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>: price is little high imo, so try to use it til the end!</li>

            <li> Flavor was okay, but not the best - there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re actually so nice that I don&#x27;t even want to polish them.</li>
            <li> I really liked the lemon butter creme.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to spend the $30 for Dior because its the best or  if you want fast results.</li>
            <li> : moisturizes my cuticles well, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> They even look nice after I&#x27;ve washed my hands and without lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this is good for your cuticles (i noticed a difference when I used it- better moisturized cuticles than just lotion)</li>
            <li> I loved how smooth my hands are now!</li>
            <li> This product is effective and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> If I go even 2-3 days without some kind of moisture on my hands</li>
            <li> I need to either rub the excess around like a hand cream or kind of wipe it off when I&#x27;m done otherwise</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant -not too strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on around cuticles easily, smells good.</li>
            <li> Would use it more often if it would rub in better!</li>
            <li> and I am so proud of how my hands look for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li> Burts Bees rocks, I love how this has softened my cuticles and keeps them from catching and splitting</li>
            <li> It is, as far as I can tell, perfect.</li>
            <li> It would work as lip balm better than cuticle cream to be honest.  </li>
            <li> This cuticle cream is incredibly helpful and is very guy</li>
            <li> but this is very light and not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> This product is very light and not greasy, so you can wear it throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Nice product and easily applied.</li>
            <li> This cuticle cream is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> Immediately my skin felt better, and within a week, my hands looked better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li> I love Burts, and this gets added to my list of favorites.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make them any better by picking at them either.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic P:)</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It works and I like the smell, the reason for four stars, is it says its a cream, but its more like a Balm, so it sits on top of the skin more&lt;</li>
            <li> more waxy---</li>
            <li> I think that this is one product that women, men, and children will love.</li>
            <li> Just OK.</li>
            <li> THANK GOODNESS for this magical cream.</li>
            <li> (This ties as my favorite of the line with the Peppermint Soap.)</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to moisturizer my nails</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is simply THE best cuticle cream I have ever tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting way better results than 2 weeks using this.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it makes my cuticles and nails appear healthy...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> br /&gt;The creme, as others noted, is more of a wax (think lip balm for your cuticles).</li>
            <li> I worked in the printing industry then many years as a janitor.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> it just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; while dryness is removed and my nails look healthy between manicures.</li>
            <li> Love all Burt&#x27;s bees products</li>
            <li> but, still, most of us would prefer not paying more</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think the smell is my favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This keeps my cuticles in check :-)</li>
            <li> It is more of a balm (like chapstick texture) than creme</li>
            <li> Also love the exfoliation I get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of lemons, love lemony smell of products.</li>
            <li> I so love the scent of the cuticle cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and have been using it for many months.  </li>
            <li> Using this product makes the nails look \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would package this product in more of a chapstick type applicator</li>
            <li> And the smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream -</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, light lemony fragrance that is yummy, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on things like oily/greasy products do.  </li>
            <li> First off, this stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lovely and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I think this is more suited as a maintenance treatment for cuticles than it is for helping remove frayed or overgrown cuticles.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> so you could more easily target just the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very soft, and it is great for both fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it does smell nice but it really hasn&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a company that uses great quality natural and health-promoting ingredients, too.</li>
            <li> I was hooked and if you buy this cream and a lip balm product you will be amazed at how much more comfortable summer and winter can be.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle butter so much!!!</li>
            <li> First off, love the scent!  </li>
            <li> Nice lemon scent, not too strong, and rich cream that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to apply in bed and not get it</li>
            <li> It smells great, absorbs quick, and it keeps your cuticles and nails soft and moisturized even through hand-washing!</li>
            <li> Im using it along w/ OPI avoplex cuticle and works just fine.</li>
            <li> However, the word &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is not quite accurate...</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall really happy with the product and am on my 3rd tin already-</li>
            <li> Nothing like the chemically lemon scent a lot of products have, this one genuinely smells like the fruit</li>
            <li> so I thought this would help, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Anyway so far so good</li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves the cuticles a little greasy, but not bad, and it works great!</li>
            <li> The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff make your nails look healthier with moisterized cuticles, but boy does it smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I found this item not only to have a light citric fresh scent but to work great on moisturizing my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and look so much more healthy even after coming out of the pool.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a more positive review for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh lemony smell and my cuticles not only look better about after 2 weeks of use, but it has also helped stop my nail biting habit!</li>
            <li> /&gt;J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Burt&#x27;s Bees Enthusiast</li>
            <li> My manicurist couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked (and in only ONE DAY!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contains, Sweet almond oil ~ beeswax ~ lemon oil ~</li>
            <li> to the consistency, I would really call this more of a balm than a creme.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll last a good 24 hours if not longer.</li>
            <li> Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.   </li>
            <li> This stuff makes such a huge difference and keeps my nails and cuticles looking and feeling hydrated and healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite thing out of the entire \\&quot;healthy hands\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Waxy nature keeps the balm on my cuticles unlike creams that vanish so quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this and use it without lucky.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent cuticle cream that works.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF, highly recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bees products are legendary and while this would normally get 5 stars in relation to competing products, Burt&#x27;s has set the expectation bar high and as a result slips in at 4 stars based on the cons I listed above.</li>
            <li> I have had much better success with either using an oil or a cream called Healthy Hoof that I bought in a drugstore for $3.99 which contains almost double the amount as in the Burt&#x27;s Bees cream.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my nails strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> It will be at first of course!</li>
            <li> The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has such a wonderful line of products; wish I had the time and $$ to try every single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other cuticle creams, but they are all more suitable for nighttime when it doesn&#x27;t matter if youre fingers are greaasy.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles look and feel great while using this, though it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product that I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, but if you need something heavy duty, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and after it&#x27;s fully absorbed my cuticles feel alleviated and soft.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of lemons, I love the soft lemony smell of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m enjoying the results so far.</li>
            <li> and painting my nails frequently and removing them with acetone isn&#x27;t the most nourishing thing either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good, and is much cheaper than lemony flutter and they are basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is particularly useful for people like me who don&#x27;t paint fingernails.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t fun when I ruined my freshly styled hair when I ran my hands through it a while after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a greasy feeling, but it drys up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s one of the reasons we read these reviews, right?</li>
            <li> I use it at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am super happy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This more or less , I think there are better at lower prices.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is better or worse at that, but it does smell and feel pleasant.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of this and it does not have a strong greasy feeling like other products do.  </li>
            <li> I put the hand salve on first.</li>
            <li> In conjunction, I take vitamins, take extra folic acid and biotin, I eve apply castor oil on my cuticles to maintain my fingernails and cuticles healthy.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever went to get a manicure, the aesthetician was taken aback: &amp;#34;You&#x27;re cuticles are perfect,&amp;#34; she said with incredulity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped getting manicures because I don&#x27;t believe a man&#x27;s hands should be overly pretty.</li>
            <li> It  works pretty well, too.</li>
            <li> This cuticle cream does absolutely nothing for my cuticles and doesn&#x27;t nourish my nails one bit!  </li>
            <li> My top lip always gets red and chapped during the winter time.</li>
            <li> I was a cosmetologist in my younger years and have tried many cuticle products.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product when I lived in Seattle, WA and it was one of the first Burt&#x27;s Bees products I ever found.</li>
            <li> Many of the products have multiple uses and</li>
            <li> and it really does seem to help!</li>
            <li> Never thought this cr√®me cures my running skin(the top skin next to your cuticle tears along a side of your nails) after every cuticle cut.  </li>
            <li> Butter is such an appropriate name for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately unless I said \\&quot;this is the best company ever...</li>
            <li> Well... honestly at first what do you expect in a lotion/cream?</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a week, but I am in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gardener, and my  hand get pretty beat up sometimes.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it since it works better than the last cuticle product I used.</li>
            <li> It also stays put pretty much, I use it right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I had very dry cuticles, instantly my cuticles looked great.</li>
            <li> I also love how it smells nice and lemony but not too strong or artificial.</li>
            <li> The smell is great but subtle.</li>
            <li> I have to use something much stronger such as Kerasal even on the nails and cuticles, it works much better.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Massaging this into them has helped them so much and they are much softer now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural sweet lemon scent, not cloying or fake-smelling.</li>
            <li> I feel like my cuticles are super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> my nails and fingers look 100X better, not all dry.  </li>
            <li> It sort of looks like there is a &#x27;clear coat&#x27; on yours nails after using this product from the very first day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you apply it at least 5 times a day!</li>
            <li> However, I paid nearly eight dollars, having become lazy and assuming the price on Amazon would be as good or better than any only to discover that I could have gotten it from Ulta or Beauty.com for under six.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands from to many years with drying chemicals.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It smells VERY lemony...</li>
            <li> This is a product that works very well.</li>
            <li> It does not make that much difference regarding the condition of my cuticles, however.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my cracked nails and flaky cuticles.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely use it every time I see it.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> My nails seem very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I really could not wait to tell anyone about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion it absorbs fast though so it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> It just takes a couple minutes and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> The Suave lotion is much cheaper and easier to use, but it also leaves my hands feeling greasier than this stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind, and it moisturizes great  </li>
            <li> It conditions the cuticles, moisturizes the skin around your nail bed and really does work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do wish that I didn&#x27;t have to use it quite so often, but that is really my fault because of all the yard/house work I&#x27;ve been doing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so great if you want to remove thick cuticles completely.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it, but it just does not make that much difference in the shape of my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances &amp; often find that I can&#x27;t use certain products because of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin of cuticle creme and it is the second of many.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a particularly longer and colder winter in Chicago this season and the weather was beginning to do a number on my cuticles and hands.</li>
            <li> Now, for me personally my cuticles weren&#x27;t super gnarly or anything</li>
            <li> This stuff is decent, it does moisturize your cuticles.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are very soft and don&#x27;t crack as much after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for your cuticles.</li>
            <li> Highly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff because it&#x27;s organic and Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t test on animals.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very waxy, smells nice, and helps heal torn, sad cuticles quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little more moisturizing</li>
            <li> I smear a little bit of this stuff on top, and within an hours time, the redness is gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect that from anything a little more heavy-duty, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would definitely not be something you&#x27;d want to leave in the car on a hot day!</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a long way which is good too.</li>
            <li> It gentle and soft in your cuticle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gravitate towards a lemon scent</li>
            <li> My nails felt better after a few days.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, so I use it liberally as needed... and maybe even when not really needed since it smells so lemony fresh!</li>
            <li> I had heard a friend say that she can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is one amazing product.</li>
            <li> I put it on before going to sleep and wake up in the morning with soft, perfect cuticles - it also helps with hangnails and those painful splits in the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Sure the ingredient list is &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, however you can save your few dollars and just buy any natural oil and your nails will look shiny and be nourished for hoursss.</li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used everything under the sun for my cracking skin near my nails, and nothing works like this!</li>
            <li> But apparently if I keep using this creme, I don&#x27;t really need manicures anyway.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> (I applied everyday on all 10 fingers for last 3 weeks, and at this speed I can use this whole thing for 4-6 more months)&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> In 2 days my cuticles were soft and stopped cracking!</li>
            <li> Be careful because if you suffer from a nut allergy this has sweet almond oil in it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it can be a bit messy and oily for a bit until my skin fully absorbs it but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> Worth a try if you have dry, cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn&#x27;t rich enough.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m in the clear.</li>
            <li> Apply on cuticles, and they will appear soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> ingredients are all natural too, which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> For a professional guy, this will keep your hands looking like gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a creme should rub in completely, and this does not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the greasy complaints I&#x27;ve seen about this product?</li>
            <li> Professional manicures just never made my list of priorities.  </li>
            <li> My nails look neater and cleaner since using this, and my hands feel really soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons.</li>
            <li> The lemon-colored cream smells like fresh lemon, and the texture is harder than Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with some of my cuticles, particularly on the fingers that are affected mostly by mild nail psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I love how thick the cream is yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> EVER!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used several much more expensive, even special oils, etc.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good is your cuticles aren&#x27;t too bad off .</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon in the past, I&#x27;ve also noticed this product at both Target and Walgreens for about the same price that may be more convenient to pick up vs. ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cuticles went from being in really bad shape (dry, cracked, split) to perfect after using this for just 2 nights.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> my cuticles are finally looking normal again after using this product for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are quickly back to normal (within a day or two)</li>
            <li> I work with my hands a lot and tend to have dry and fraying cuticles/eponychium (the skin right above your cuticle).</li>
            <li> I ordered a few more directly from Amazon.com to leave in my desk and other parts of the house.</li>
            <li> which is much different from my other cuticle oil that only took a bit of rubbing to get my free hanging cuticle off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles and set out to find a cuticle cream that would really work (lots of products claim to but don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also put it on dry knuckles before bed, and by morning they are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the lemon smell and the thick cream that instantly enhances my cuticle</li>
            <li> I had a major reaction from this.</li>
            <li> I have  used most every product in the drugstore to soften and heal my cracked and tough cuticles, but none of them had the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use much each time, so the box will last long.</li>
            <li> Instantly makes your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> but it never really changed much.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with dry cuticles and this not only prevents that</li>
            <li> so they do not dry out and cause problems.</li>
            <li> and he really hates conventional beauty products.</li>
            <li> Then my nails are back to normal again, dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m washing my hands and sanitizing several times a day (we&#x27;re barely pass flu season).</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming or too powerful.</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails and very dry cuticles even though I live in humid Florida.</li>
            <li> It keeps your cuticules soft and they never look dry.</li>
            <li> Took about a week of daily use to clear up hangnails &amp; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> : price is little high imo, so try to use it til the end!</li>
            <li> I had a couple that I had to pick at with other nails to get them to come off completely</li>
            <li> On my toes where I have worse cuticles and dried up areas around the toe nail, this product doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li> On my hands where the dryness isn&#x27;t half as bad this product is great.</li>
            <li> Still no idea why my cuticles are so dry and constantly chopping.</li>
            <li> My cuticles grow faster than my nails, they get constant hangnails, are extremely dry and crack.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s better than having dried out cracking fingers.</li>
            <li> After 1 week I noticed a big difference I have recommended this product to other ladies who also have the same results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited maybe I wont have so many painful hangnails this winter!!</li>
            <li> I think I will repurchase this as long as the company makes it.</li>
            <li> It stays on the cuticle and moisturizes it for a long time.</li>
            <li> been using it for a long while now</li>
            <li> I have struggled with biting my nails and cuticles for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products i&#x27;ve tried this stuff actually works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but this is the only stuff that not only heals but also moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are constantly dry whether it&#x27;s the summer or winter.</li>
            <li> helped my dry nails.</li>
            <li> It feels silky and creamy all while turning dry nails into lemon scented shimmering health.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with dry, cracked cuticles - until today.  </li>
            <li> It has helped my dry nails and cuticles like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I got this to help with my dry winter cuticles, which were getting flaky and peeling.</li>
            <li> It did work on dry nail.</li>
            <li> but they were in a dry state a LOT from working with food</li>
            <li> My cuticle are always dry.</li>
            <li> or my cuticles start to dry out again, but that will vary depending on your skin and climate.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my cuticles get so dry</li>
            <li> It has improved my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> my cuticles were still dry, though.</li>
            <li> Question mine has a slight sandy, gritty feel</li>
            <li> and my cuticles were very dry.</li>
            <li> The skin around my nails always gets dried, cracked and cut, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I deal with paper almost 99.9 percent at the office and it was making my cuticles very dry and rough looking.</li>
            <li> Also, it is so gritty and has little pieces coming off</li>
            <li> It moisturizes only for a little while.</li>
            <li> It does leave a little residue of crumbly cuticle residue after my cuticles get pushed back.</li>
            <li> (meaning washing my hands constantly) and swimming in the pool everyday (chlorine KILLS my cuticles.. makes em so dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly solid, which makes it hard to get out enough product to put on your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really creamy---</li>
            <li> each lasts me roughly 4-6 weeks</li>
            <li> after even a FEW days I&#x27;ve noticed BIG changes.</li>
            <li> It smells roughly like Lemon Pledge.  </li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday but already my cuticles are less dry and</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What a &amp;#34;cuticle creme&amp;#34; actually does, I&#x27;m not totally sure.</li>
            <li> i like other burts bees pruducts for mens hands.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small pot, but you only need the tiniest amount for your fingers.</li>
            <li> When I u use this regularly I don&#x27;t get any sort of irritation on my cuticles like usual without.</li>
            <li> Size is sort of small - opt for a larger size, if available&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing special to me, sorry!</li>
            <li> ordered this because lots of nail people on YouTube recommended it, not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from cuticle oil to extra-strength hand cream to paraffin dips with no success.      </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The tin is relatively small but the amount will go a long way because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at a time.</li>
            <li> The cream is just thick enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve read other reviews, I plan to try it on my elbows and feet as well!</li>
            <li> hard to find for some strange reason.</li>
            <li> I work in retail cosmetics and have my hands in cosmetics products, and on people&#x27;s faces, all day long at least 5 days per week.</li>
            <li> but my cuticles are too dry and hard to maintain</li>
            <li> , my cuticles aren&#x27;t horrible, but I live in a part of Texas where the air is dry and the city environment can really wear on your skin.</li>
            <li> Bees Cuticle Creme Lemon Butter is the product that I take with me on the go, apply to my hands and fingers as needed, keeping this little tin in my purse.</li>
            <li> When the edges of my nails start cracking and bleeding, that&#x27;s when I dig up my little tin of Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff beats all of them, HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad cuticles because I tend to pick at them, but after about a weeks worth of use</li>
            <li> I was having a serious issue with my skin peeling around the cuticles and now my fingers are not so dry.</li>
            <li> I will buy this stuff for the rest of my life if it continues working the way it has in just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Am I missing something ?</li>
            <li> Now I apply every few days and no problems.  </li>
            <li> too greasy few minutes (3min)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky, since it&#x27;s so thick, but I find that this is not a problem if you just dab a little on your nails and work it in.</li>
            <li> always had the bad cuticles and my nails were just overall gross...</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes it soaks in enough that the residue isn&#x27;t too bad, but there is definitely some residue.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, (but great for Burt&#x27;s Bees), I have the worst nails and cuticles I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of dry cuticles and getting paper cuts all the time</li>
            <li> On a whim, I purchased this cream thinking that it would at least give a few minutes of relief.  </li>
            <li> It lasted me over six months now, truthfully I&#x27;m not understanding what the rave is about.</li>
            <li> Applying it is a bit tricky and you usually end up with excess on the tips of your fingers.  </li>
            <li> The container is on the small side.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had mine for at least a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with very dry cuticles and in the cold winter months experience chipping nails and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My only negative (and the reason that I did not give this product five stars) is that it is expensive for the quantity.  </li>
            <li> An unfortunate habit of biting my cuticles, combined with a chronic dry skin condition, has resulted in 30+ years of hiding my hands.  </li>
            <li> I, unfortunately, have a compullsion to bite and pick and the dry areas to the point of my fingers bleeding.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of using liquid cuticle oils since they&#x27;re messy &amp; hard to keep from getting on everything.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to wait a week at LEAST before I give a review of this product.</li>
            <li> The balm is thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cuticle cream that has a zesty lemon smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick product</li>
            <li> I mean an hour or two</li>
            <li> Also, despite the tub being so small it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Hardness of a cold stick of butter in room temperature (&amp;#60;75), and cold Vaseline in hot temperatures (90+).&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I refuse to take medication that could cause liver failure and my physician agreed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles which drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> It was a bit expensive ($5) for a little tub of it, but</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hands were extremely chapped from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> My cuticles were dry cracked and ugly, working in the health field</li>
            <li> The worse part for me is the hangnails I would get and the resulting pain when I would hit them.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product...that is, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the lemon scent.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes the cuticles so they aren&#x27;t all white and annoying looking.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles were always raw, ragged, and completely ugly.  </li>
            <li> During the winter I always get \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; around my nails, not only painful but ugly.  </li>
            <li> While on a business trip to a cold climate, my cuticles were particularly ugly and so sensitive they were painful.  </li>
            <li> The toll that this takes on my hands and fingers, and even on my feet (standing all day), is sad...</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear of Burt&#x27;s passing.</li>
            <li> my cuticles get dry and cracked, and it&#x27;s awful.</li>

            <li> Saves my cuticles when they get too bad, twice or three times a day</li>
            <li> did I get a bad batch or is this the lemon peel in it?</li>
            <li> It was quite painful before, too, when it did.</li>
            <li> and I get painful hangnails.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cuticle cream is fantastic! I have extremely dry cuticles which drive me crazy. I&#x27;m always picking at them and as a result, I have damaged my nails. Since using this cream about three weeks now, I have noticed a dramatic change! It has a wonderful but light lemon scent, not overpowering. I would recommend this to anyone.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since high school and it really makes my nails strong. Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I did research before buying this product and it met all expectations.  It has greatly helped my cuticles making them appear almost invisible.  It also smells very good.</li>
            <li> ordered this because lots of nail people on YouTube recommended it, not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> An unfortunate habit of biting my cuticles, combined with a chronic dry skin condition, has resulted in 30+ years of hiding my hands.  My cuticles were always raw, ragged, and completely ugly.  I tried everything from cuticle oil to extra-strength hand cream to paraffin dips with no success.      While on a business trip to a cold climate, my cuticles were particularly ugly and so sensitive they were painful.  On a whim, I purchased this cream thinking that it would at least give a few minutes of relief.  Immediately my skin felt better, and within a week, my hands looked better than they ever have.  I keep a tin at work, at home, and in my travel bag - it&#x27;s great for travel.  I&#x27;ll never be without it again - it&#x27;s amazing.      p.s.  Their Miracle Salve works wonderfully on cracked heels as well.</li>
            <li> I love Burts, and this gets added to my list of favorites. Leaves the cuticles a little greasy, but not bad, and it works great!</li>
            <li> My cuticles are constantly dry whether it&#x27;s the summer or winter. I don&#x27;t make them any better by picking at them either. This creme is amazing, I put this on after I put on my hand lotion and massage them in and after it&#x27;s fully absorbed my cuticles feel alleviated and soft. I have tried cuticles oils before that never did anything, just made my hands feel greasy. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it can be a bit messy and oily for a bit until my skin fully absorbs it but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I have used everything under the sun for my cracking skin near my nails, and nothing works like this! In fact, nothing else kept the skin from cracking, period! I also like Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve, which I buy regularly, now, too. I highly recommend this. I use it at night. I put the hand salve on first. Then, I put the cuticle cream on my fingertips only. I wear gloves to protect my sheets. I reapply once or twice in the night. I don&#x27;t think my skin will crack anymore, because of this. It was quite painful before, too, when it did.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My feet look and feel smooth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing special to me, sorry!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with some of my cuticles, particularly on the fingers that are affected mostly by mild nail psoriasis. I refuse to take medication that could cause liver failure and my physician agreed. So, she suggested I continue doing what&#x27;s worked best for me. In conjunction, I take vitamins, take extra folic acid and biotin, I eve apply castor oil on my cuticles to maintain my fingernails and cuticles healthy. This cuticle butter smells great and feels great. I carry it in my purse so I don&#x27;t forget to apply it (which is almost daily).</li>
            <li> Eh. Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever went to get a manicure, the aesthetician was taken aback: &amp;#34;You&#x27;re cuticles are perfect,&amp;#34; she said with incredulity. Since I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle creme at nights for about three years, I have to guess that whatever this product is supposed to do, it does well. What a &amp;#34;cuticle creme&amp;#34; actually does, I&#x27;m not totally sure. I&#x27;m a guy -- I don&#x27;t know how cuticles are supposed to look. I just know that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes good products, and this smells great, so I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped getting manicures because I don&#x27;t believe a man&#x27;s hands should be overly pretty. But apparently if I keep using this creme, I don&#x27;t really need manicures anyway.</li>
            <li> I deal with paper almost 99.9 percent at the office and it was making my cuticles very dry and rough looking. I got tired of dry cuticles and getting paper cuts all the time so i tried this. Unlike other products i&#x27;ve tried this stuff actually works! When i leave in the morning i put it on and wear gloves  so that while i&#x27;m waiting for the bus the stuff does it&#x27;s magic P:) I also love how it smells nice and lemony but not too strong or artificial. A little of this stuff goes a long way which is good too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for your cuticles. Smells like lemon pie and WORKS. It&#x27;s the best cuticle balm does not leave that see thru nail problem that greasy cuticle leaves.   I buy two at a time one in my purse, one at home.</li>
            <li> This is a winter must-have. The balm is thick and moisturizing. It keeps nails from cracking and cuticles from getting ragged. The lemon oil makes it smell absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a little sticky, since it&#x27;s so thick, but I find that this is not a problem if you just dab a little on your nails and work it in. Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.   The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good is your cuticles aren&#x27;t too bad off . On my hands where the dryness isn&#x27;t half as bad this product is great. On my toes where I have worse cuticles and dried up areas around the toe nail, this product doesn&#x27;t work half as good. I have to use something much stronger such as Kerasal even on the nails and cuticles, it works much better.</li>
            <li> Using this product saves me $100s of dollars on Manicures/Pedicures.  It feels and smells great.  I use in combination with a cuticle trimmer for best results.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised! I don&#x27;t normally gravitate towards a lemon scent but this is very light and not overbearing at all. I love how thick the cream is yet not greasy. You need only a tiny bit for your nails. Now that I&#x27;ve read other reviews, I plan to try it on my elbows and feet as well!</li>
            <li> The best thing to happen to cuticles since vaseline</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells VERY lemony...so if you don&#x27;t like that smell, this is not for you. Not greasy, soaks into nail bed nicely.</li>
            <li> Smells great but does not solve the cracked cuticle problem</li>
            <li> My cuticles were dry cracked and ugly, working in the health field I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands.I discovered this product in a Pharmaceuticals store, it works wonders I definitely have to stock up on this item.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees rocks, I love how this has softened my cuticles and keeps them from catching and splitting</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on around cuticles easily, smells good.</li>
            <li> It works and I like the smell, the reason for four stars, is it says its a cream, but its more like a Balm, so it sits on top of the skin more&lt;br /&gt;then a creme would do,</li>
            <li> I cut my cuticles -I know people would disagree on that.. but my cuticles are too dry and hard to maintain so I cut them. I read and watched reviews on this product and decided to buy one. It is a miracle. It lasts for hours -even when after washing my hands. It does make my nail polish look filmy but my cuticles look great. It smells pleasant -not too strong. I use it for my toes and heel! I think I will repurchase this as long as the company makes it. Very impressed... and my cuticles are happy again.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of lemons, I love the soft lemony smell of this product. It  works pretty well, too. I thought it would be a little more moisturizing but it does make a difference on your cuticles.  Worth a try if you have dry, cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> I recieved the cuticle creme in a pack for Christmas... and well. It&#x27;s my favorite thing out of the entire \\&quot;healthy hands\\&quot; kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a ritual nail biter since childhood, and now being 21 I have a reason to not bite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not suggesting this will work for everyone to deter nail biting, but I found that by taking the time to take care of my nails that I didn&#x27;t want to ruin them by biting them any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had the bad cuticles and my nails were just overall gross... but now they&#x27;re growing out nicely. My cuticles aren&#x27;t frayed and my nails are shinier than they&#x27;ve ever been. They&#x27;re actually so nice that I don&#x27;t even want to polish them. It sort of looks like there is a &#x27;clear coat&#x27; on yours nails after using this product from the very first day. After a while using them you actually feel your nail get smoother...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME product.</li>
            <li> Love the lemon smell and the thick cream that instantly enhances my cuticle condition.&lt;br /&gt;I was ripped off by this seller but think I paid for the lesson to goole the price before placing on line order.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll keep on buying this.</li>
            <li> Waxy nature keeps the balm on my cuticles unlike creams that vanish so quickly. Took about a week of daily use to clear up hangnails &amp; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I had very dry cuticles, instantly my cuticles looked great. I use a couple of times a day, in 2 weeks my nails are stronger and look so much better! I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails and very dry cuticles even though I live in humid Florida. This cuticle cream does absolutely nothing for my cuticles and doesn&#x27;t nourish my nails one bit!  Also, it is so gritty and has little pieces coming off that after I apply it, I wipe it off again, not to have those disagreeable pieces on everything I touch. I have had much better success with either using an oil or a cream called Healthy Hoof that I bought in a drugstore for $3.99 which contains almost double the amount as in the Burt&#x27;s Bees cream.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and i like the smell and how hydrate my cuticles get by the morning. Im using it along w/ OPI avoplex cuticle and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I think this is a wonderful product. I may have reviewed it before but I think it is truly a five star item, It enabled the cuticles on my thumbs to heal, This product should be kept and used to prevent ragged and sore cuticles as well as healing sore ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you apply it at least 5 times a day!</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is amazing. It&#x27;s not really creamy---more waxy---and so it&#x27;s not greasy as you would perhaps expect. It stays on the cuticle and moisturizes it for a long time. My husband lets me use it on his cuticles when I give him a manicure and he really hates conventional beauty products. I think that this is one product that women, men, and children will love. The scent is yummy, too, and not overpowering. It&#x27;s a treat to use. Burt&#x27;s Bees is a company that uses great quality natural and health-promoting ingredients, too. This is a product that works very well. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of great recommendations for this. It smells great, is not greasy, and the compact is very handy. It does not make that much difference regarding the condition of my cuticles, however. It moisturizes only for a little while. I wish I had a more positive review for this product. I had high hopes for it, but it just does not make that much difference in the shape of my cuticles. Just OK.</li>
            <li> Still no idea why my cuticles are so dry and constantly chopping. And I didn&#x27;t even know what to search for to fix it. THANK GOODNESS for this magical cream. Saves my cuticles when they get too bad, twice or three times a day and i&#x27;m in the clear.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  I use this for chapped lips. My top lip always gets red and chapped during the winter time. I smear a little bit of this stuff on top, and within an hours time, the redness is gone.  I highly recommend this stuff because it&#x27;s organic and Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t test on animals.    &#x60;&#x60;Katrina</li>
            <li> Having tried this from the Head to Toe Starter Kit, I had to buy the full-sized product. (This ties as my favorite of the line with the Peppermint Soap.) The Lemon Butter Cuticle Crme is not greasy, waxy, overly smelly, or disagreeable in any way. It is, as far as I can tell, perfect. I was a cosmetologist in my younger years and have tried many cuticle products. This is the best I have ever used. The scent is very soft, and it is great for both fingers and toes. After using this crme for several weeks, my nails seem healthier and stronger, and my cuticles feel softened and conditioned. Highly recommended.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Burt&#x27;s Bees Enthusiast</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have found to soften my cuticles. It smells amazing and has a great price as well.</li>
            <li> This really is as good as they claim! Apply on cuticles, and they will appear soft and moisturized. It also has a really good lemon smell. You also don&#x27;t have to use much each time, so the box will last long.</li>
            <li> Love it! helped my dry nails.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to moisturizer my nails and it works</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells amazing and works wonders for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles and set out to find a cuticle cream that would really work (lots of products claim to but don&#x27;t). Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is simply THE best cuticle cream I have ever tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!).</li>
            <li> There is nothing quite like this zesty cuticle cream. It feels silky and creamy all while turning dry nails into lemon scented shimmering health. I started to use this product when I lived in Seattle, WA and it was one of the first Burt&#x27;s Bees products I ever found. I was hooked and if you buy this cream and a lip balm product you will be amazed at how much more comfortable summer and winter can be. I&#x27;ve been known to rub this onto my elbows and feet before bed. Many of the products have multiple uses and this one smell so delicious you might have to go out and buy lemons and make a lemon meringue pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> This has really helped my cracked nails and flaky cuticles. After 1 week I noticed a big difference I have recommended this product to other ladies who also have the same results. My daughter uses the creme on the cuticles of her feet and is amazed how well its worked on her cuticles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, (but great for Burt&#x27;s Bees), I have the worst nails and cuticles I have ever seen.  My cuticles grow faster than my nails, they get constant hangnails, are extremely dry and crack.  I was going to get a manicure to try to strengthen my nails and I didn&#x27;t want to listen to the lectures from the tech about my nails and cuticles, so I bought a tin of Burt&#x27;s lemon cuticle cream the day before my appointment.  24 hours later, it was as if there had been a miracle!  My manicurist couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked (and in only ONE DAY!). It has been about a week now and I am so proud of how my hands look for the first time in years!  I encourage everyone with horrible cuticles and nails to give this a try.  Having the manicure is also helping my nails grow.</li>
            <li> Whoever this Burt guy is deserves a big hug.  I have always had problems with dry, cracked cuticles - until today.  I had heard a friend say that she can&#x27;t live without it, so when I saw it in the grocery store today I decided to try it.  It was a bit expensive ($5) for a little tub of it, but MAN...I don&#x27;t care anymore.  I will buy this stuff for the rest of my life if it continues working the way it has in just a few hours.  Seriously, this is one amazing product.</li>
            <li> I like the creamy feel and smell of this lemon butter and it really does seem to help!</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried tons. It smells great, absorbs quick, and it keeps your cuticles and nails soft and moisturized even through hand-washing! I have and would recommend this product to anyone looking for healthy nails!</li>
            <li> my cuticles look awful. i work in a kitchen and i was my hands constantly. my cuticles are finally looking normal again after using this product for a couple of days. i so impressed  and the smell is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the lemon butter creme. It seems to work to moisturize and it is pleasant to smell.I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to save money so I got this.  Not worth it. Three days using Dior Creme Apricot and I&#x27;m getting way better results than 2 weeks using this.  It would work as lip balm better than cuticle cream to be honest.  If you&#x27;re really trying to fix your nails, this is a waste of your money.  You&#x27;ll have to spend the $30 for Dior because its the best or  if you want fast results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one as it is gritty. Works well if you don&#x27;t mind that texture yet I do.  Arrived without delay.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream and it lasts a long time. Used it for several years at night.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;This also works very good for cracked fingertips during the winter,&lt;br /&gt;and softens knuckles, elbows.The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;We feel this cuticle cream is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains, Sweet almond oil ~ beeswax ~ lemon oil ~ tocopheryl acetate ~ tocopherol (vitamin E)~&lt;br /&gt;coca butter ~ candelilla wax ~ rosemary extract ~ beta carotene.</li>
            <li> The skin around my nails always gets dried, cracked and cut, especially during the dry winter months. I had been using Neosporin type ointments to help heal the cuts. That&#x27;s until I found this stuff. I put it on at night and it helps heal the damages caused during the day. It&#x27;s a little greasy, but this is the only stuff that not only heals but also moisturizes. Lotion just stings on nicks but this stuff doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pricey for such a little container but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much. It gentle and soft in your cuticle. The smell is great but subtle. Put in and around your cuticle and that it.</li>
            <li> This smells like freshly-squeezed lemons, and works wonders on my cuticles. I work with my hands a lot and tend to have dry and fraying cuticles/eponychium (the skin right above your cuticle). My cuticles look and feel great while using this, though it is a little greasy. I&#x27;d expect that from anything a little more heavy-duty, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural too, which is an added plus. I try to use this at night and when I wake up, though sometimes I&#x27;ll try it out during the day, as well. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but I&#x27;m enjoying the results so far.</li>
            <li> Never thought this cr√®me cures my running skin(the top skin next to your cuticle tears along a side of your nails) after every cuticle cut.  Now, I use it on every time I have had my cuticle done and never notice any tear anymore.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> This more or less , I think there are better at lower prices.</li>
            <li> Greasy, but thats the point. Hydrates cuticles but need to apply atleast twice a day to see results. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars for the price. Price is 4 and change from what I recall in the drugstore. It lasted me over six months now, truthfully I&#x27;m not understanding what the rave is about. Am I missing something ? It&#x27;s a thick cuticle cream that has a zesty lemon smell to it. Sure the ingredient list is &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, however you can save your few dollars and just buy any natural oil and your nails will look shiny and be nourished for hoursss. Furthermore, it makes my cuticles and nails appear healthy... But only temporarily, and by temporarily I mean an hour or two if that. Then my nails are back to normal again, dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It has helped my dry nails and cuticles like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love the wonderful lemony scent as well.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Nice product and easily applied.</li>
            <li> I work in retail cosmetics and have my hands in cosmetics products, and on people&#x27;s faces, all day long at least 5 days per week. Cleansers, foundations, misters, moisturizing lotions... The toll that this takes on my hands and fingers, and even on my feet (standing all day), is sad... and I rely on products like this to help me bounce back.  Burt&#x27;s Bees has such a wonderful line of products; wish I had the time and $$ to try every single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Creme Lemon Butter is the product that I take with me on the go, apply to my hands and fingers as needed, keeping this little tin in my purse. It is not greasy at all, so I use it liberally as needed... and maybe even when not really needed since it smells so lemony fresh! Love this stuff and it seems to work well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to provide cuticle and hands treatment as I have described, then I would recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Creme Lemon Butter to you based on my experience with it. It just seems to freshen up my day when I use it, and helps keep my hands and fingers in good condition so that I feel good and can keep my customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF, highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;-  IG: chinanailsxo</li>
            <li> Moisturizes, heals the cracked cuticle, not mentioning the smell IT IS LEMON REFRESHING SCENT!!!!!!! it will make your nails and cuticle look healthy and beautiful and clean absolutely great product</li>
            <li> Oh this stuff is great.  Absolutely use it every time I see it.  The best feeling cuticles EVER!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used several much more expensive, even special oils, etc.  This stuff beats all of them, HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> Seems to work will in moisturizing my cuticles and pushing them back. It does leave a little residue of crumbly cuticle residue after my cuticles get pushed back. Seems to help a lot, but it is not a long-term fix. My cuticles are quickly back to normal (within a day or two) if I don&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this and use it without lucky.  Seems like when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn&#x27;t rich enough.  I could put it on 3-5 times a day and it didn&#x27;t help.  I switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called Bee Nuts and have had great luck with it.</li>
            <li> This product smells lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for a long while now and it works very well. My nails seem very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick product so it&#x27;s easy to apply in bed and not get it everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Be careful because if you suffer from a nut allergy this has sweet almond oil in it. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes either! I had a major reaction from this.</li>
            <li> Only cuticle cream that has actually helped my hands out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin of cuticle creme and it is the second of many. I have  used most every product in the drugstore to soften and heal my cracked and tough cuticles, but none of them had the results of this product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The creme, as others noted, is more of a wax (think lip balm for your cuticles). Just rub your fingers along the surface and rub it on your cuticles. No matter their condition, with daily use, Burt&#x27;s Bees will transform them into a picture of health. The tin lasts for quite a while (I had mine for 8 months).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews so please bear with me.  I have very dry hands from to many years with drying chemicals. I worked in the printing industry then many years as a janitor. The worse part for me is the hangnails I would get and the resulting pain when I would hit them.  Burt&#x27;s Bees - Cuticle Creme applied through out the day cured it all.  Now I apply every few days and no problems.  We lost our local supplier so I was happy to find it posted on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works wonders on dry cuticles.  I also love the smell. It&#x27;s pleasant and subtle. My favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with very dry cuticles and in the cold winter months experience chipping nails and dry skin. This cuticle cream is incredibly helpful and is very guy friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have noted there is a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent, but this is not feminine- it just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; while dryness is removed and my nails look healthy between manicures. For a professional guy, this will keep your hands looking like gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon in the past, I&#x27;ve also noticed this product at both Target and Walgreens for about the same price that may be more convenient to pick up vs. ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall really happy with the product and am on my 3rd tin already- each lasts me roughly 4-6 weeks but your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously my favorite it works great! Worth the price! Best of all, it smells so good! I will definately buy this again! Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love all Burt&#x27;s bees products</li>
            <li> I put this on every night before bed to keep my cuticles nice and moisturized! It does take a bit to absorb, but leaves my hands smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> Using it several times a day seems to keep my prone-to-split and peel fingernails together. I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> Since this is a product review, I am giving five stars because the product is perfect. It&#x27;s yummy fragrance, indisputable effectiveness along with its ease of use make it a must-have, especially if you are like me and have problem cuticles that peel, crack, bleed and hurt if they&#x27;re not given a bit of TLC.  However, I paid nearly eight dollars, having become lazy and assuming the price on Amazon would be as good or better than any only to discover that I could have gotten it from Ulta or Beauty.com for under six. Totally my fault, I know that, but maybe this will help someone else who is in a hurry and about to do what I did because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s good stuff and a couple of bucks won&#x27;t kill me -- but, still, most of us would prefer not paying more than we have to; it&#x27;s one of the reasons we read these reviews, right?</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my dry winter cuticles, which were getting flaky and peeling. Immediately after applying, they felt soothed and softened. It might be a bit much in milder weather, as it is a bit oily, but it could just be that I applied it heavily. I&#x27;ve also put it on dry knuckles before bed, and by morning they are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic! It&#x27;s a natural sweet lemon scent, not cloying or fake-smelling. Just fresh, citrus-y, and delicious. I think the smell is my favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the consistency, I would really call this more of a balm than a creme. This would definitely not be something you&#x27;d want to leave in the car on a hot day!</li>
            <li> I picked up a Burt Bee&#x27;s Lemon Butter Cuticle Creme from Walgreens when I ran out of my OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil To Go. I forgot how much I loved this product. It&#x27;s been a particularly longer and colder winter in Chicago this season and the weather was beginning to do a number on my cuticles and hands. I should have taken a before and after pic this morning. It smells heavenly, it leaves a great sheen and moisturizes so well! Butter is such an appropriate name for this moisturizer. I keep one in my desk at work. In my second trimester of pregnancy, I&#x27;m ALWAYS in the bathroom (TMI?) and so I&#x27;m washing my hands and sanitizing several times a day (we&#x27;re barely pass flu season). This keeps my cuticles in check :-)</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle cream! Instantly makes your cuticles soft. I was having a serious issue with my skin peeling around the cuticles and now my fingers are not so dry. The fragrance is lovely and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent cuticle cream that works. I ordered a few more directly from Amazon.com to leave in my desk and other parts of the house. The tin is relatively small but the amount will go a long way because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at a time. It is more of a balm (like chapstick texture) than creme but it works nevertheless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have issues with shipping and ended up having to purchase this from CVS. It&#x27;s $5.99 there. I also saw that Wal-Mart has it as well. Definitely pick some up as soon as possible, you won&#x27;t be sorry!ck but unfortunately unless I said \\&quot;this is the best company ever...5.0 xoxo\\&quot; it would be removed.</li>
            <li> The lemon-colored cream smells like fresh lemon, and the texture is harder than Vaseline. Hardness of a cold stick of butter in room temperature (&amp;#60;75), and cold Vaseline in hot temperatures (90+).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: moisturizes my cuticles well, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy few minutes (3min) after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: price is little high imo, so try to use it til the end! (I applied everyday on all 10 fingers for last 3 weeks, and at this speed I can use this whole thing for 4-6 more months)&lt;br /&gt;Also I would prefer it to be a balm stick, rather than a tin-opening style.</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear of Burt&#x27;s passing. His products are the best. I have a real problem with dry cuticles and this not only prevents that, it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Used this every night on my cuticle before  bed</li>
            <li> First off, love the scent!  Also love the exfoliation I get.  However, the word &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is not quite accurate... a creme should rub in completely, and this does not.  I use it at night, and end up rubbing it into my hands so as not to get &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; all over my sheets.  Would use it more often if it would rub in better!</li>
            <li> works great on a working mans cuticles. a little goes a long way. i like other burts bees pruducts for mens hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of lemons, love lemony smell of products. I so love the scent of the cuticle cream. I&#x27;ve rubbed this onto nails around before bed. It did work on dry nail.</li>
            <li> This is the only cuticle creme I have used that made a difference. I have always had really bad cuticles because I tend to pick at them, but after about a weeks worth of use you can definitely start to see a difference. If you keep up with putting it on you will be happy with the results. It does have a greasy feeling, but it drys up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to wait a week at LEAST before I give a review of this product. But I really could not wait to tell anyone about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS. IS. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why people complain about this? Now, for me personally my cuticles weren&#x27;t super gnarly or anything but they were in a dry state a LOT from working with food (meaning washing my hands constantly) and swimming in the pool everyday (chlorine KILLS my cuticles.. makes em so dry! Geez) and painting my nails frequently and removing them with acetone isn&#x27;t the most nourishing thing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after even a FEW days I&#x27;ve noticed BIG changes. They are so soft and look so much more healthy even after coming out of the pool. They even look nice after I&#x27;ve washed my hands and without lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the greasy complaints I&#x27;ve seen about this product? Well... honestly at first what do you expect in a lotion/cream? It will be at first of course! In my opinion it absorbs fast though so it isn&#x27;t a problem. And I put a GOOD amount on. It just takes a couple minutes and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this. It&#x27;ll repair cuticles in any shape with diligent use! And it couldn&#x27;t hurt to use it in conjunction with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff make your nails look healthier with moisterized cuticles, but boy does it smell amazing! I probably look like a creeper walking around smelling my fingers after applying this but I can&#x27;t help it. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My cuticle are always dry. Massaging this into them has helped them so much and they are much softer now!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like lip balm but for your cuticles. It comes in a small pot, but you only need the tiniest amount for your fingers. I have only had this for a week, but I am in love. It smells good, and is much cheaper than lemony flutter and they are basically the same thing. I feel like my cuticles are super moisturized and soft. I only apply this once a day, and they stay hydrated all day. I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying like crazy (I will also use cuticle oil once a day to help prevent dryness). Overall, I am super happy and would definitely recommend. Especially if you like doing your nails a lot ( like me).</li>
            <li> Softens and conditions my jagged cuticles.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I learned that Clorox had bought Burt&#x27;s Bees.      Now I am in the market for another product that does the same thing, but is manufactured by a corporation I can stand to support.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff for keeping those cuticles in good shape so they do not dry out and cause problems. It has a good scent -- not all girly, so it&#x27;s good for guys (like me) who wash their hands often and gals who like the lemony freshness.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle butter so much!!!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely horrible cuticles and very dry areas around my nails. I, unfortunately, have a compullsion to bite and pick and the dry areas to the point of my fingers bleeding. I read the reviews and decided to try this. It is very easy to use and it does smell nice but it really hasn&#x27;t helped. it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all and I love anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees but this just didn&#x27;t do much for me. I did apply it compullsively to try and get the moisture back but it never really changed much. Oh well, I guess it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product...that is, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the lemon scent.  I use this product every day and have been using it for many months.  It moisturizes the cuticles so they aren&#x27;t all white and annoying looking.  This is particularly useful for people like me who don&#x27;t paint fingernails.  Professional manicures just never made my list of priorities.  Using this product makes the nails look \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and healthy.  I can&#x27;t imagine being without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gardener, and my  hand get pretty beat up sometimes. When the edges of my nails start cracking and bleeding, that&#x27;s when I dig up my little tin of Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream. It&#x27;s very waxy, smells nice, and helps heal torn, sad cuticles quickly. Do yourself a favor and get some of this stuff before your hands get too thrashed!</li>
            <li> I love the fresh lemony smell and my cuticles not only look better about after 2 weeks of use, but it has also helped stop my nail biting habit!</li>
            <li> During the winter I always get \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; around my nails, not only painful but ugly.  I started using the cuticle creme and haven&#x27;t had a \\&quot;crack\\&quot; since.  It has become my nightly routine.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Although this is good for your cuticles (i noticed a difference when I used it- better moisturized cuticles than just lotion) it got on my nerves. Very greasy and thick. I would recommend sleeping in it if you could.</li>
            <li> This stuff is decent, it does moisturize your cuticles. It smells roughly like Lemon Pledge.  Applying it is a bit tricky and you usually end up with excess on the tips of your fingers.  I wish they would package this product in more of a chapstick type applicator so you could more easily target just the cuticles.  Instead you end up with some of it on your fingertips so keep a paper towel close by so you can wipe them off.  After about 10 minutes it soaks in enough that the residue isn&#x27;t too bad, but there is definitely some residue.  I find that I have to apply it 3-4 times a day or my cuticles start to dry out again, but that will vary depending on your skin and climate.  It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s better than having dried out cracking fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hands were extremely chapped from the cold weather. I loved how smooth my hands are now!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Made a huge difference keeping my cuticles hydrated and smells great. When I u use this regularly I don&#x27;t get any sort of irritation on my cuticles like usual without.</li>
            <li> This lemon butter cuticle cream smells great. It&#x27;s fairly solid, which makes it hard to get out enough product to put on your fingers. It feels waxy, kind of like Chapstick, but in a pleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted something specifically for cuticles, although I had been using Suave vitamin E body lotion on my hands. The Suave lotion is much cheaper and easier to use, but it also leaves my hands feeling greasier than this stuff. Still, I know the cheaper Suave lotion was helping me solve my hangnail problem. I can&#x27;t say that this is better or worse at that, but it does smell and feel pleasant.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday but already my cuticles are less dry and my nails and fingers look 100X better, not all dry.  In the winter my cuticles get so dry and I get painful hangnails. I wash my hands alot so I thought this would help, so far so good. It smells great too. Question mine has a slight sandy, gritty feel did I get a bad batch or is this the lemon peel in it? Anyway so far so good and I&#x27;m excited maybe I wont have so many painful hangnails this winter!! This would make an excellent stocking stuffer or gift, it&#x27;s a nice surprize to buy something that acutally does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. I am very happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind, and it moisturizes great  would recommend.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Cuticle Cr√®me has kept my nails and cuticles looking great for years. And the smell is fabulous! I use it to perk me up when I&#x27;m weary at work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF AND THE WAY MY CUTICLES FEEL AFTER I PUT IT ON, WAY TO GO</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream. It really works!!! I have always had cuticle problems but I don&#x27;t when I use this cream.</li>
            <li> I found this item not only to have a light citric fresh scent but to work great on moisturizing my nails and cuticles. I would recommend this item to anyone. I use it at night right before bed. Works great!</li>
            <li> This product is effective and smells nice.  It conditions the cuticles, moisturizes the skin around your nail bed and really does work.</li>
            <li> this is a good product. Makes my nails feel great and they feel alot healthier. I loe burts bees! yay</li>
            <li> love this stuff. hard to find for some strange reason.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of using liquid cuticle oils since they&#x27;re messy &amp; hard to keep from getting on everything. I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances &amp; often find that I can&#x27;t use certain products because of this. The creme smells great though and isn&#x27;t too overpowering. It also stays put pretty much, I use it right before I go to bed. Overall a very good product that I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream - I keep a jar on my desk at all times.  Nice lemon scent, not too strong, and rich cream that absorbs quickly.  Makes a great emergency cream too.</li>
            <li> This is the only cuticle cream you need! I have tried other brands but always come back to this one. I put it on before going to sleep and wake up in the morning with soft, perfect cuticles - it also helps with hangnails and those painful splits in the cuticle. My cuticles went from being in really bad shape (dry, cracked, split) to perfect after using this for just 2 nights.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of this and it does not have a strong greasy feeling like other products do.  It has improved my dry cuticles.  My only negative (and the reason that I did not give this product five stars) is that it is expensive for the quantity.  The container is on the small side.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with biting my nails and cuticles for as long as I can remember. This stuff makes such a huge difference and keeps my nails and cuticles looking and feeling hydrated and healthy! Plus the smell is wonderful! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My cuticles are very soft and don&#x27;t crack as much after using this. I do wish that I didn&#x27;t have to use it quite so often, but that is really my fault because of all the yard/house work I&#x27;ve been doing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees when doing my manicure before I put polish on my nails. It keeps your cuticules soft and they never look dry. I am very pleased with the product and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have tried other cuticle creams, but they are all more suitable for nighttime when it doesn&#x27;t matter if youre fingers are greaasy.  This product is very light and not greasy, so you can wear it throughout the day.  It has a nice, light lemony fragrance that is yummy, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on things like oily/greasy products do.  It&#x27;s now my go-to cuticle cream for daytime.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to find in stores.  This is good stuff, works for us.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot, but it seems to work well and I would recommend it since it works better than the last cuticle product I used.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff smells amazing! Nothing like the chemically lemon scent a lot of products have, this one genuinely smells like the fruit and it&#x27;s lovely and refreshing. Also, despite the tub being so small it lasts forever! I think I&#x27;ve had mine for at least a few months and there&#x27;s still plenty left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my cuticles aren&#x27;t horrible, but I live in a part of Texas where the air is dry and the city environment can really wear on your skin. If I go even 2-3 days without some kind of moisture on my hands my cuticles get dry and cracked, and it&#x27;s awful. This cuticle cream does a great job at moisturizing and KEEPING them that way for a while. I really only have to apply it once a day and it&#x27;ll last a good 24 hours if not longer. My nails look neater and cleaner since using this, and my hands feel really soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. It&#x27;s not so great if you want to remove thick cuticles completely. I had a couple that I had to pick at with other nails to get them to come off completely which is much different from my other cuticle oil that only took a bit of rubbing to get my free hanging cuticle off. Second, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast into your skin. I need to either rub the excess around like a hand cream or kind of wipe it off when I&#x27;m done otherwise everything I touch has a sticky greasy feeling. It wasn&#x27;t fun when I ruined my freshly styled hair when I ran my hands through it a while after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think it&#x27;s a great product, but if you need something heavy duty, look elsewhere. I think this is more suited as a maintenance treatment for cuticles than it is for helping remove frayed or overgrown cuticles. I&#x27;d recommend Essie&#x27;s cuticle oil if you need a stronger one.</li>
            <li> Love. My nails felt better after a few days.</li>
            <li> I used to be a very bad nail biter and my cuticles were very dry. Once I stopped biting my nails my cuticles were still dry, though. This stuff has literally been my savior. Without it, I pick at my fingers all day. Works wonders! Love Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This is a great item to carry with you and have at home.  It smells really good and nourishes the cuticles.</li>
            <li> Works great! In 2 days my cuticles were soft and stopped cracking! Also helped alleviate pain and strengthen my nails!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The scent is not overwhelming or too powerful. The cream is just thick enough to do the job.I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips too because it smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li> i ordered this and started applying it immediately. My nails are already longer. Awesome product came 2 days after i ordered it, and i would definately reccomend it to someone else.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Burt&#x27;s Bees makes some great products and this is one of them&lt;br /&gt;  Provides good protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Size is sort of small - opt for a larger size, if available&lt;br /&gt;  Flavor was okay, but not the best - there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees products are legendary and while this would normally get 5 stars in relation to competing products, Burt&#x27;s has set the expectation bar high and as a result slips in at 4 stars based on the cons I listed above.</li>
