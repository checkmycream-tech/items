            <li>but now we are used to it and the girls love it!!</li>

            <li>It smells great and keeps their hair in good shape.</li>
            <li>Leaves our kids hair clean and beautiful and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li>It works really good in my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good organic shampoo for the price.  </li>
            <li>Be forewarned if you have a girly-girl who loves fragrance and products that smell good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great &amp; the Ltr price is better than the salon.</li>
            <li>It also smells good and feels nice.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I could not make it there to buy more and found it on amazon!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is organic too!</li>
            <li>(my daughter even commented the first time about how wonderful they smell), and they do their job.  </li>
            <li>Very happy, thanks!</li>
            <li>they are amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot say enough how great and happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells really nice</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my own hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this smells great and leaves her hair so soft, clean and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does work nicely at making my daughters hair easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Using a combination of this and the Terminator Nit Comb, we are able to keep the buggers at bay.</li>
            <li>Kids love the shampo and we as parents hope it repels lice.</li>
            <li>My co-workers grand kids use it for years and never had lice again.</li>
            <li>We love all the Fairy Tale products, leave in conditioner, gel and hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, in spite of receiving more lice notice letters from the school, we have not had any return.</li>
            <li>Would have given more stars</li>
            <li>And I LOVE that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t damage her hair like the chemicals in Rid and Nix seem to do.  </li>
            <li>my daughter is still lice free!  </li>
            <li>All three love this product</li>
            <li>and I love the way it leaves their hair.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Smells good &amp; my hair is much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter to use as an easy leave-in conditioner for camp (and as a preventative for lice).  </li>
            <li>It leaves a scent in their hair that I don&#x27;t find too strong after they use it at night...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and it really works!</li>
            <li>We stayed lice free when there was an epidemic</li>
            <li>Amazon had a great price for this big bottle.</li>
            <li>and she still is lice free.</li>
            <li>But this is very good to keep the hair clean, healthy and free from lice, instead of using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li>It has a unique scent that took awhile to get used to, but for peace of mind, I can tolerate it.</li>
            <li>I can also say that I like the smell and that it makes all of our hair feel clean and look shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is organic and that I can by the large sizes on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product we have been lice free and been worth every cent</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s natural and it has a nice smell - lemony.</li>
            <li>I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products .  </li>
            <li>After a lice incident in our house it is well worth the money for prevention.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was worth it, just for the peace of mind.</li>
            <li>But I figure it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty smell and it really helps detangle long hair.</li>
            <li>First, buy the ROBICOMB.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>We had our first experience with lice when my children returned to school in the fall.  </li>
            <li>We got rid of the lice this time after the first week.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It leaves hair looking great, seems to be a great lice repellant, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other brands of Tea Tree shampoos and I can assure you that Fairy Tales works the best.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>But I started using it, and I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li>My child has very curly hair</li>
            <li>Gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve decided to use Fairy Tales Shampoo, Conditioner, and Leave In Conditioning Spray all the time on the whole family.  </li>
            <li>and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  </li>
            <li>and I really like both of them.</li>
            <li>The only cure is really comb, comb, comb!!!</li>
            <li>I got this after trying many other options to get rid of lice.</li>
            <li>At first, the smell was a little potent</li>
            <li>My girls used to get lice pretty frequently.</li>
            <li>Its ok, but it dries out your hair if using everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fantastic with tangles, but better than just using the shampoo by itself.  </li>
            <li>I am a paranoid mom and lice is something that I could live without..</li>
            <li>Since the use of all Fairy Tale products, so far they&#x27;ve avoided getting lice again despite the annual reports I get from school of lice issues!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as my kids are in elementary school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells strongly of rosemary essential oil, which makes for a potent and not very pleasant aroma to be clinging to a kiddo&#x27;s hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I feel I am having a positive impact on my children&#x27;s future health using this product.</li>
            <li>The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  </li>
            <li>but by the next morning you can&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>So far, my kids haven&#x27;t come home from school with lice.</li>
            <li>All Natural Organic Hair Care for Children...</li>
            <li>b/c now my 3 year old daughter is paying the price.......</li>
            <li>In any case, with the lice now a part of ancient history, my 13-year old daughter (who this was ordered for) will not longer use it because</li>
            <li>Leaves their hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth the piece of mind knowing we&#x27;re taking active measures to prevent the spread of lice in schools.</li>
            <li>I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed to it since we started using it (at least not that I know of), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I think it gives my hair a little volume (I have long hair), and it has a nice fresh subtle rosemary scent.</li>
            <li>finally decide to try this all natural product after being concerned on the chemical exposure to her and her hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>my two younger kids got it but neither my 7 year old</li>
            <li>Not sure if it truely works to repell lice</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t know how any bug would live on a head that smells like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It is subtle and clean.</li>

            <li> My daughter has very thick, straight hair and this product works well.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is expensive, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Like others commented, this conditioner is not much to write home about.  </li>
            <li> After reading online that 34% of school aged kids have lice at any given time during the school year, I decided it was time to take preventative measures.  </li>
            <li> All times we spent HOURS washing clothes and checking her hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong, but nothing too unpleasant.</li>
            <li> After the second prescription treatment we ordered the small bottles to test to see if it would work.</li>
            <li> If you had to you could add essential oils to it, but you could also buy a plain conditioner from a health store and add essentials to it!  </li>
            <li> She has mixed ethnicities and her hair is very thick, curly, and long.</li>
            <li> Not much of a problem with lice down at their schools, but I&#x27;m not wanting to ever have a problem either!</li>
            <li> those little buggars cause.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I wasted my $ on this product rather than going directly through the Fairytales Company.  </li>
            <li> We used to use the shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray everyday.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it killed lice as we never had</li>
            <li> I tried some other brand of spray detangler and it left my child&#x27;s hair feeling weird.</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way, so it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> The girls use this everyday and there was an outbreak of lice in the school, my girls didn&#x27;t get it!</li>
            <li> but neither kid has had a repeat of our unfortunate experience with lice from last year.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL this past week...</li>
            <li> Not sure if the shampoo and conditioner are preventing her coming home with lice, but I&#x27;ll keep believing it&#x27;s working until proven otherwise</li>
            <li> The package (box) was broken and the conditioner bottle spilled a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product deserves the credit, but we&#x27;ve been through class invasions of lice at least 20 times for all three children and never were afflicted.  </li>
            <li> She just started school, so I&#x27;m excited about the lice repellent benefits as well - even though we haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it yet!</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed so far!  </li>
            <li> The cost of this shampoo/conditioner, it is less expensive and time consuming than managing lice.</li>
            <li> There has been a serious outbreak of lice at her school for close to a month</li>
            <li> So all in all just to be safer than sorry, I am a continual customer of this product.</li>
            <li> I used every expensive shampoo in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it till it&#x27;s gone because it was so expensive</li>
            <li> and I hate to see that money go to waste, but</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but my daughter &amp; I both use it &amp; it lasts close to 2 months.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had lice despite others around us dealing with it, so I&#x27;m guessing this works at repelling the little buggers, but the smell of the conditioner (and shampoo) is just awful.</li>
            <li> and I hope I never get proven wrong!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> $25 is nothing compared to the grief</li>
            <li> and I hate</li>
            <li> The shampoo is horrible and will not rinse out of my daughters hair-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this product. It has a nice minty smell and it really helps detangle long hair. Knock on wood, so far we&#x27;ve never had lice and lice has gone around our school a few times.</li>
            <li> I am a paranoid mom and lice is something that I could live without.. so I am taking precautions! The girls use this everyday and there was an outbreak of lice in the school, my girls didn&#x27;t get it! So if this helped or not, I can&#x27;t say but I can say that they didn&#x27;t come home with lice! It leaves a scent in their hair that I don&#x27;t find too strong after they use it at night... but by the next morning you can&#x27;t really smell it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and my girls don&#x27;t have a lot of tangles. So all in all just to be safer than sorry, I am a continual customer of this product.</li>
            <li> My wife buys this all the time. Faithfull customer for the last 4 years!!</li>
            <li> Pump broke within a week, so I had to re-bottle the shampoo. Its ok, but it dries out your hair if using everyday. We have used this product (not daily) for over 2 years now and haven&#x27;t had a single louse in my house.</li>
            <li> My daughters had fought lice for months. I used every expensive shampoo in the drug store. You need to fight lice in 2 ways. First, buy the ROBICOMB. $25 is nothing compared to the grief those little buggars cause. Secondly, wash your kids with this fairy shampoo. My kids do not think that the shampoo smells that great. It does keep your family from being reinfected. Pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li> The Fairy Tales products are great.  After a wicked lice breakout at school I&#x27;ll do anything to prevent my son EVER getting lice again. Once was enough!  On amazon I can get the larger sizes a lot cheaper than in the local salons.</li>
            <li> After my kids use this, we never get lice!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is expensive, but so worth it. We&#x27;ve had no problems with lice. I love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> The bottles weren&#x27;t closed properly so they came covered in shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this product exclusively for 9 months. We haven&#x27;t had another lice outbreak so I guess it&#x27;s working. If she gets lice in the future while using the Fairy Tales product I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is organic and that I can by the large sizes on amazon.  Not sure if it truely works to repell lice but neither kid has had a repeat of our unfortunate experience with lice from last year.  The kids like the smell and it seems to work well as a conditioner.  We intend to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It works really good in my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  Leaves it soft and shinny. Makes her hair easier to comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandaughter because she was having problems at school with lice. I used it on her hair religiously and they still came back. The only way to get lice out is nit pick!!</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this product! Leaves our kids hair clean and beautiful and smells wonderful!! And have not had anymore problems with lice!! Highly recommend!! Thank u!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use as an easy leave-in conditioner for camp (and as a preventative for lice).  But I started using it, and I actually really like it.  I think it gives my hair a little volume (I have long hair), and it has a nice fresh subtle rosemary scent.</li>
            <li> I got this after trying many other options to get rid of lice. Using a combination of this and the Terminator Nit Comb, we are able to keep the buggers at bay. I got a tea tree shampoo for myself as well, just in case!! The only cure is really comb, comb, comb!!! But this seems to help from reinfestation as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, however, improperly packaged. The package (box) was broken and the conditioner bottle spilled a little.</li>
            <li> My daughter lice kept coming back after three treatments. She has mixed ethnicities and her hair is very thick, curly, and long. Using the tiny comb was not happening.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decide to try this all natural product after being concerned on the chemical exposure to her and her hair.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff did the trick. We haven&#x27;t had one breakout since using the shampoo and conditioner after the last treatment. No itchy head, not nits, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;We also employed Zippity Doos lice prevention hair gel which is perfect for her hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot say enough how great and happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. We use it with the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo. I have not seen the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; anywhere on the product. But this is very good to keep the hair clean, healthy and free from lice, instead of using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo/conditioner for my daughter and came across this at Target. I DID NOT know it was a repel conditioner when I purchased it so I can&#x27;t rate it on lice prevention/treatment as my daugther has never had lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this smells great and leaves her hair so soft, clean and smelling wonderful. No residue and no tangles!</li>
            <li> Kids love the shampo and we as parents hope it repels lice. My co-workers grand kids use it for years and never had lice again.</li>
            <li> My kids use this every night as a preventative for lice.  It has a unique scent that took awhile to get used to, but for peace of mind, I can tolerate it. So far, my kids haven&#x27;t come home from school with lice.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had lice despite others around us dealing with it, so I&#x27;m guessing this works at repelling the little buggers, but the smell of the conditioner (and shampoo) is just awful. It&#x27;s smells strongly of rosemary essential oil, which makes for a potent and not very pleasant aroma to be clinging to a kiddo&#x27;s hair all day long. I will keep using it till it&#x27;s gone because it was so expensive and I hate to see that money go to waste, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it ever again.</li>
            <li> Like others commented, this conditioner is not much to write home about.  I cannot smell any essential oils in this conditioner.  In fact it has an almost perfume stinky odor.  I would not purchase this product again.  If you had to you could add essential oils to it, but you could also buy a plain conditioner from a health store and add essentials to it!  Not impressed.  However, I do like the shampoo and leave in spray conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product deserves the credit, but we&#x27;ve been through class invasions of lice at least 20 times for all three children and never were afflicted.  We use it with the shampoo and the spray every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this product to prevent lice for my school age children.  My two daughters got lice from school when they were 4 and 5.  Since the use of all Fairy Tale products, so far they&#x27;ve avoided getting lice again despite the annual reports I get from school of lice issues! Our daughters are now 9 and 7.  We love all the Fairy Tale products, leave in conditioner, gel and hairspray.  It is very effective!</li>
            <li> It was leaking when I got the package!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  I was buying it a local hair salon and decided to check for it on Amazon.  Now, I buy the bulk liter sizes instead of the smaller sizes at salon.  This stuff really works!  I use the shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray conditioner as a 3 part regimen to protect from undesirable pests getting in my kids&#x27; hair at school.  I have tried a few other brands of Tea Tree shampoos and I can assure you that Fairy Tales works the best.  It also smells good and feels nice.</li>
            <li> We stayed lice free when there was an epidemic</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. I have been using last 2 uears</li>
            <li> Awesome preventative!</li>
            <li> No lice since we started using Fairy Tales All Natural Organic Hair Care for Children...Repel is great!  A great place to find good products IS Amazon.com</li>
            <li> After reading online that 34% of school aged kids have lice at any given time during the school year, I decided it was time to take preventative measures.  I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products .  I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed to it since we started using it (at least not that I know of), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural and organic.  I can also say that I like the smell and that it makes all of our hair feel clean and look shiny.  Even IF it doesn’t actually work to prevent lice, I’d buy it again for those reasons alone.  I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> We use this throughout the school year, just in case...  Wonderful quality.  Wouldn&#x27;t go back to school without.</li>
            <li> Amazon had a great price for this big bottle. My child has very curly hair and I use it daily as a detangler and styling cream. No crunch or residue and has a great smell. I tried some other brand of spray detangler and it left my child&#x27;s hair feeling weird. This allows me to get the tangles out and revitalizes her curls.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my 7 year old and myself for a few weeks. My nephews brought over lice and my two younger kids got it but neither my 7 year old or I got it! Definitely helps repel lice.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My daughter has uber curly hair and this makes combing it a breeze.  We leave conditioner in and do not rinse out.  She just started school, so I&#x27;m excited about the lice repellent benefits as well - even though we haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it yet!</li>
            <li> Must have for all girls!</li>
            <li> Good organic shampoo for the price.  Don&#x27;t know if it repels lice but we haven&#x27;t had a case while using it.  It will last a lot longer if you buy the pump.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Thank You for the great product and service.</li>
            <li> My daughter started using this product last school year when lice was going around all year. When this year started, we forgot to use Fairy Tales.  We used to use the shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray everyday.  Guess what we are now dealing with...lice! I believe in this product.  The cost out weighs the pain in dealing with lice removal.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for this project.  We had our first experience with lice when my children returned to school in the fall.  Since using this product, in spite of receiving more lice notice letters from the school, we have not had any return.</li>
            <li> I specifically called Fairytales and they informed me that anything w/ a white cap is either expired or diluted.  I am so sorry I wasted my $ on this product rather than going directly through the Fairytales Company.  The shampoo is horrible and will not rinse out of my daughters hair- and we now have lice... again- this did NOTHING for us and if this has be diluted or expired, shame on this company for selling this!!!! It&#x27;s \\&quot;Brand Names for Less\\&quot; for a reason folks- do not trust them!&lt;br /&gt;Go through Fairytales the company- they are amazing and I hate I got scammed b/c now my 3 year old daughter is paying the price.......</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the shampoo. We like it and it seems to work well. When a lice outbreak occured at school this year my kids had no problems.</li>
            <li> Guess it works, kids haven&#x27;t caught lice from school yet. Ick!!!  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t know how any bug would live on a head that smells like this shampoo!  It takes awhile to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> Our lice did not reappear, so either the shampoo did the trick or it was the medicated treatment we did beforehand. In any case, with the lice now a part of ancient history, my 13-year old daughter (who this was ordered for) will not longer use it because \\&quot;it stinks.\\&quot; While I would not go that far, the scent is not especially pleasant. Be forewarned if you have a girly-girl who loves fragrance and products that smell good.</li>
            <li> During the school year this is the only shampoo and conditioner my kids use. After a lice incident in our house it is well worth the money for prevention. Gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but my daughter &amp; I both use it &amp; it lasts close to 2 months. Smells good &amp; my hair is much softer than it used to be. It&#x27;s also worth the piece of mind knowing we&#x27;re taking active measures to prevent the spread of lice in schools.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells really nice and I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxic ingredients being spread all over my kids&#x27; heads.  I feel I am having a positive impact on my children&#x27;s future health using this product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. My daughter has not contracted lice. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. I have even used it on my own hair. Would have given more stars but I ordered conditioner and received a leaky shampoo. I ordered the conditioner from another seller.</li>
            <li> I got this to go with the RR Shampoo.  It does what it says.  It&#x27;s not fantastic with tangles, but better than just using the shampoo by itself.  Also doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> My daughter has gotten lice at school three times in the last six years, twice in the last year.  Last year it took us three months to finally get rid of it.  This time decided to fork over the money and buy the Fairy Tales my friend swore worked miracles for her kids.  I have not been disappointed so far!  We got rid of the lice this time after the first week.  And I LOVE that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t damage her hair like the chemicals in Rid and Nix seem to do.  We&#x27;ve decided to use Fairy Tales Shampoo, Conditioner, and Leave In Conditioning Spray all the time on the whole family.  It leaves hair looking great, seems to be a great lice repellant, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> I started buying this where I get my kids haircut. I could not make it there to buy more and found it on amazon! It smells great and keeps their hair in good shape. Love the fact that it is organic too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great &amp; the Ltr price is better than the salon.</li>
            <li> Since the 3rd grade, lice has been a constant issue at my daughter&#x27;s school.  Last school year (4th grade), it took me months to get rid of her lice, she kept getting re-infested and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  UNTIL this past week...one of my daughter&#x27;s friends slept overnight Friday, they went to a birthday party Saturday and on Saturday night we received the dreaded &amp;#34;I have lice&amp;#34; message.  I was horrified!  As of today...my daughter is still lice free!  She was like a lice magnet in prior incidents and I thank Fairy Tales for this miracle!  I&#x27;m ecstatic and do not know why anyone wouldn&#x27;t use this product as their regular shampoo and conditioner for ever!</li>
            <li> definitely has helped us keep the lice away this year!!</li>
            <li> Does not prevent recurrences.  Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> My girls used to get lice pretty frequently. Since using this product we have been lice free and been worth every cent</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters.  All three love this product and so do I!  Smells great.  Leaves their hair soft.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> Here it is a couple of months later of using this product on a regular basis. At the time of purchase my daughter had the rid x system done twice and the prescription lice treatment done twice. All times we spent HOURS washing clothes and checking her hair. It just kept coming back. After the second prescription treatment we ordered the small bottles to test to see if it would work. We also ordered the conditioning spray. We would wash and condition. Then every day before school use the spray. She has not had lice since. This stuff is amazing and it really works!</li>
            <li> When lice was going around our kids school, I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances. I started washing their hair with the shampoo and using this conditioner. The smell is a bit strong, but nothing too unpleasant. I can&#x27;t say if it killed lice as we never had any- but my kids never got it either. Maybe it was worth it, just for the peace of mind. A little also goes a long way, so it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter and son uese the shampoo, conditioner, and especially the leave-in conditioner now as their regular products.  They smell great (my daughter even commented the first time about how wonderful they smell), and they do their job.  Not much of a problem with lice down at their schools, but I&#x27;m not wanting to ever have a problem either!</li>
            <li> Best product I have found to help repel against these nasty bugs! I use this religiously with my girls because there are constantly outbreaks at their school. At first, the smell was a little potent but now we are used to it and the girls love it!! Spend the extra money on this and BUY it!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Makes my hair look great, it&#x27;s natural and it has a nice smell - lemony.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll never know if my kids would not have lice or if this is what is helping to repel them. But I figure it is worth the gamble. The cost of this shampoo/conditioner, it is less expensive and time consuming than managing lice. The conditioner does work nicely at making my daughters hair easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li> Ive had my girls using this for a year and I love the way it leaves their hair.  The scent is not overpowering. It is subtle and clean.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Very happy, thanks!</li>
            <li> We got the shampoo and conditioner and I really like both of them. My daughter has very thick, straight hair and this product works well. There has been a serious outbreak of lice at her school for close to a month and she still is lice free. Not sure if the shampoo and conditioner are preventing her coming home with lice, but I&#x27;ll keep believing it&#x27;s working until proven otherwise and I hope I never get proven wrong!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. The smell is great! Works well too. I will continue to buy it as long as my kids are in elementary school. Thanks!</li>
