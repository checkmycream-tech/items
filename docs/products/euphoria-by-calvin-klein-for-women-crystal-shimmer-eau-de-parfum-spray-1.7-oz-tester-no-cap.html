            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it when I get a hint of a person&#x27;s perfume as they walk by.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of woman who prefers the scent of men&#x27;s colognes over most women&#x27;s perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments, even from men.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments from this scent.</li>
            <li>I bought the perfume based on good reviews here and let just say I will either try them in stores or buy samplers first from now on.  </li>
            <li>Its smells warm and sweet, almost sugary and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>When it wears out a bit after some time, it smells super nice.  </li>
            <li>It is very refreshing, and stays on very niceley.</li>
            <li>Its so sensual and wonderful a little squirt goes along way!</li>
            <li>The scent is warm,woody,full and sweet with a light oriental touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few over the years that I liked and found attractive in fragrance, but when I first smelled Euphoria in a magazine ad I was hooked.</li>
            <li>Liked BCBGs Metro fragrance, the first I really enjoyed since Obsession back in the 80&#x27;s, but Euphoria?!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the gel for those who are allergic to sprays and those who like a deeper, more layered fragrance (you have to rub it on your skin before you get dressed).</li>
            <li>It has such a unique, amazing smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Euphoria comes in perfume gel form that is ideal for anyone who wants a less alcohol based scent.  </li>
            <li>However, I liked this scent enough that I have been wearing it every day, even to work.</li>
            <li>This is a great new fragrance that I will be wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li>so much for trying to be unique.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, but quite light, playful and cinamony sweet.</li>
            <li>Havent really been able to find a new scent for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, but not overpowering like most musky heavy scents.</li>
            <li>this is the first time i ordered a perfume online.</li>
            <li>Many perfumes give me instant headaches.</li>
            <li>I would give it more than 5 stars if that was possible!</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite fragrances of all time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and still do go to others just for something different</li>
            <li>(Reminded me of when Poison first came out and someone wore it to school...</li>
            <li>The woodsy floral is just the thing I run to when I want to feel a little special, but not overtly sexy.</li>
            <li>Dior Pure Poison, Dior J&#x27;dore, Chanel Chance, Alfred Sung Shi, Escada Island Paradise, and Estee Lauder Pleasures.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely divine.  </li>
            <li>I hope other people are able to smell this as I walk by.</li>
            <li>I hope I am as satisfied in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Most people overlook it since it comes in a small, unobtrusive silver tube shape pump.  </li>
            <li>I smelled Euphoria in Cosmo the previous month and had a fit over it.  </li>
            <li>I loooove this perfume its the only thing I wear wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else highly recommended</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought with this seller and the Euphoria was FAKE!!!   The fragrance does not fix the skin and the perfume does not come with the label.    REGRETTED!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loooove this perfume its the only thing I wear wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else highly recommended</li>
            <li> this is the first time i ordered a perfume online. i was somewhat skeptical about getting fake one. it arrived this morning and i am wearing it ever since. i simply love it...hasn&#x60;t worn off yet. makes me feel fresh and happy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells awesome however the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have found that it stains clothing and the bottle I have right now is not spraying as a mist anymore, it comes out a lot more than it should. I am assuming a blockage has occurred since I do not use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume. It is not heavy, but quite light, playful and cinamony sweet. It is very refreshing, and stays on very niceley. When it wears out a bit after some time, it smells super nice.  I recommend it because its a flirty scent, and good for any occasion. Love it. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Euphoria comes in perfume gel form that is ideal for anyone who wants a less alcohol based scent.  Most people overlook it since it comes in a small, unobtrusive silver tube shape pump.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I highly recommend the gel for those who are allergic to sprays and those who like a deeper, more layered fragrance (you have to rub it on your skin before you get dressed).</li>
            <li> I got Ralph Lauren Style for Christmas and found it to be way to floral for my taste.  I smelled Euphoria in Cosmo the previous month and had a fit over it.  Style was returned and Euphoria was purchased!!!!  I applied it @ 7:00 in the morning (just one squirt) and could still smell it 12hrs. later.  The scent is warm and for lack of better words.......yummy!</li>
            <li> Havent really been able to find a new scent for years. Liked BCBGs Metro fragrance, the first I really enjoyed since Obsession back in the 80&#x27;s, but Euphoria?! Well, smelled it in a magazine and had a bottle the next day. It&#x27;s sexy, but not overpowering like most musky heavy scents. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever worn, I absolutely love it and feel fabulous in it.</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to get into the scent, but it is definitely something I could wear daily, alternating with the In2U.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go gung-ho over fragrances--I&#x27;ve owned a few over the years that I liked and found attractive in fragrance, but when I first smelled Euphoria in a magazine ad I was hooked. The scent is warm,woody,full and sweet with a light oriental touch. And what&#x27;s best is that Euphoria smells creamy, as though once you spray it on your skin it seeps into your skin as though it were a lotion. If there is one fragrance that is a Must-Have for 2005, Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria is it.</li>
            <li> I have other Calvin Klein fragrances but as the previous reviewer stated - once I smelled this in a magazine - I had to have it.  The senual gel is a must.  The scent just lingers and it is soooo silky.  This is a great new fragrance that I will be wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a magazine and just had to try it.  I absolutely love this smell.  Now I wish I had bought the bigger bottle! It is not overpowering and yet the fragrence lasts all day.  I will now have to see if there is a body lotion out there in Euphoria!  Thank you Calvin Klein!</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance in a magazine and decided to try it at the store. I loved the smell at the store and had to get it. As other reviewers have stated, the fragrance is different and seems to last longer than other fragrances. I hope other people are able to smell this as I walk by. I love it when I get a hint of a person&#x27;s perfume as they walk by. I hope I am as satisfied in a few weeks. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the bottle shape makes it akward to handle when spraying, something they should have thought about. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the bottle looks cool but is not as functional.</li>
            <li> Many perfumes give me instant headaches. I have been wearing this one for years. I love it. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. I have had several friends smell it on me and then go buy it for themselves. Amazon&#x27;s price is so much better then a department store!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is wonderful, my husband got it for me and it is absolutely divine.  I love it and think you will too!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this scent.  Received it as a gift for Christmas.  I&#x27;m the type of woman who prefers the scent of men&#x27;s colognes over most women&#x27;s perfumes.  I found Euphoria to not be too \\&quot;girly\\&quot; of a scent.  I&#x27;m also the type of woman who doesn&#x27;t usually wear perfume because I&#x27;m always worried about offending coworkers.  However, I liked this scent enough that I have been wearing it every day, even to work.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me before a wedding.  Let&#x27;s just say everyone loved this perfume immensley!  It has such a unique, amazing smell to it.  It makes you feel very sexy and lasts all night.  Every time I wear this perfume, people compliment me all night and can&#x27;t get enough of the smell.  I would give it more than 5 stars if that was possible!</li>
            <li> Its so sensual and wonderful a little squirt goes along way!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite fragrances of all time. It&#x27;s a beautiful combination of allure and femininity, but without the sometimes overpowering florals that are out in the market. The woodsy floral is just the thing I run to when I want to feel a little special, but not overtly sexy. I usually separate my perfumes into \\&quot;day\\&quot; and \\&quot;night\\&quot; perfumes, but this is one that I can wear any time without feeling like I&#x27;m going to cause my classmates to faint from the smell. My fragrance wardrobe inclues: Dior Pure Poison, Dior J&#x27;dore, Chanel Chance, Alfred Sung Shi, Escada Island Paradise, and Estee Lauder Pleasures.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume ever!  I&#x27;ve tried many others and still do go to others just for something different and I always come back to Euphoria. I receive so many compliments, even from men. Most of the time I can&#x27;t smell it, but I continue to get great comments...mostly asking what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing!  It&#x27;s very subtle and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hype is all about. Apparently, half the women out there are wearing it...so much for trying to be unique. I gave this 3 stars for its staying power but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.  I bought the perfume based on good reviews here and let just say I will either try them in stores or buy samplers first from now on.  It&#x27;s somewhat over-powering for me. (Reminded me of when Poison first came out and someone wore it to school...almost killed half the class with the smell). Maybe it does not mix with my chemistry or the tropical climate. I gave it to my friend&#x27;s mother who lives abroad and she loves it. Personally I think it&#x27;s over 35 scent. It&#x27;s very womanly and confident...think Samantha in Sex and the City. Flowers that bloom and give off scents at night. Anyhow, you should try it in store before order it. (My perfumes collection includes Magnatism, Pacific Paradise, Island (Michael Kors), Baby Doll, Yves Saint Rose du Bois, Envy, Envy Me, Dior Addict 2 Logomania).</li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely beautiful. Its smells warm and sweet, almost sugary and lasts all day. I have gotten many compliments from this scent. Easily one of my favorite perfumes! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
