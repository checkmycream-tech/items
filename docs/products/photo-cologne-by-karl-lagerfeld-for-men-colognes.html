            <li>thought I&#x27;d celebrate a change in the situation with a bottle of his favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them smell.</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to tell you how many years this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Use just a touch of spray and watch how many compliments you get through the day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a scent that gets my wife worked up more this.  </li>
            <li>But because of the price it still was an OK purchase.</li>
            <li>so others must be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is a great Cologne for men.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me into a girl magnet yet, but I think that I smell better with it</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t smell it as much, but have been told I smell good</li>
            <li>The sprayer works fine.  </li>
            <li>The packaging looked absolutely genuine and the bottles as well.  </li>
            <li>This is somewhat close to the original scent</li>
            <li>Clean ,Fresh!</li>
            <li>Plus, everyone always compliments how &#x27;clean&#x27;</li>
            <li>it someplace else if you want the true Photo</li>
            <li>Buy it someplace else if you want the true Photo scent.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also uncommon to find any other guy that uses it, so it became my trademark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still good, but I&#x27;d prefer something a little bit more</li>
            <li>Fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to be super close.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>it was based on true fresh Photo spray, I would rate it a five.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells very close but does not have the staying power of the original.</li>
            <li>I just love everything about this fantastic scent, it lingers on my skin all day long!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lagerfeld Photo is an amazing scent that smells fantastic on men.&lt;br /&gt;We used to purchase ours at Dillards, but no longer live near a mall.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle I received (and apparently others as well) purchased from THIS listing</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but not very distinctive.  </li>
            <li>Looking for some chaps next. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband because it was one of my favorite male calognes from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>Its amazing and compliments after an other keep coming when I use this product.</li>
            <li>What a shame that the company decided to mess with such a FORMERLY great product.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m definitely coming back to purchase more!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Which brings us to the bottom line: it is now much cheaper than before.</li>
            <li>But the scent of the cologne was very faded.  </li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how much they like the fragrance</li>
            <li>it was the real thing and cheaper than the stores have it.</li>
            <li>a shame that the company decided to mess with such a FORMERLY great product.what is being sold in THIS particular listing   is either tampered with or older than dirt itself.   </li>
            <li>regular Photo is fantastic, but what is being sold in THIS particular listing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other people about this cologne.</li>
            <li>I do recall that the lid on the original had a knurled look reminiscent of a camera body.</li>
            <li>I still had some left of the original</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how strong the odor is though as compared to my previous purchasing this cologne from a store.  </li>
            <li>either tampered with or older than dirt itself.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>The real thing can be smelled very clearly and you don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>She had me try some high dollar stuff</li>
            <li>Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around.</li>
            <li>nice mix of spice and wood scent, at least to me.</li>
            <li>shipment was quick, and it LOOKS like a new, sealed bottle, but when sprayed,&lt;br /&gt;you about have to stick a nostril directly on it to smell anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY not like regular Photo!!  </li>
            <li>But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version,</li>
            <li>Time to look for a new fragrance for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Time to look for a new fragrance for my husband.    </li>
            <li>It may be that these bottles are from a very old production year.  </li>
            <li>Scent did not last long and smelt nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>used a long time ago brings back memories of family and pets all of who I miss very much!</li>
            <li>Smells like a few other colognes I got for my hubby; but still smelled nice.</li>
            <li>The scent profile is more or less the same, but I believe the makers decided to forgo the more expensive ingredients to make for a cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is barely any scent in the bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whatever is going on with it, it barely smells like Photo at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if what is being sent out on this listing is older than dirt and therefore&lt;br /&gt;weak, or it has somehow been watered down or forged and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t know if what is being sent out on this listing is older than dirt and therefore&lt;br /&gt;weak, or it has somehow been watered down or forged and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as subtle or distinct.  </li>
            <li> Its scent is weak and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It does last fairly long.</li>
            <li> And yes, I can say this because I have a really old bottle of it with a tiny little bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not the cheap stuff either</li>
            <li> You now need to use quite a few whiffs for the smell to stay with you through the day (the old Photo only required a few drops).</li>
            <li> But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version, which   is a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.   </li>
            <li> It lasted few minutes only.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other places that Lagerfeld has changed the formulation on this fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other places that Lagerfeld has changed the formulation on this fragrance.   </li>
            <li> (Between you and me, I got it for about 1/3 the price here on Amazon over any other shops...)</li>
            <li> Compared with other cologne</li>
            <li> a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, I went with a two, because this is not a fresh product,&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Actually, less than one,</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t do half</li>
            <li> A little and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few constants in my life</li>
            <li> This is odd, to say the least.</li>
            <li> am not sure what to write in the review here, because I believe this is where you review the product,&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> From time to time strangers (usually women), like in an elevator, will  ask me for the name of the source of that smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this item for the past 20 years after reading about it in Playboy Magazine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this for my husband in the past.</li>
            <li> Even after a direct spray and sniff, almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Something is very wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard item to find in the store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a while since we bought any, because it is fairly expensive and we&#x27;ve been through a rough patch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is something definitely wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> They cannot be returned but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

But I cannot help but bring this matter up in here, to perhaps keep someone else from&lt;br /&gt;being ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband smells wonderful in Photo.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a while since we bought any, because it is fairly expensive and we&#x27;ve been through a rough patch.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d celebrate a change in the situation with a bottle of his favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is barely any scent in the bottle we received.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if what is being sent out on this listing is older than dirt and therefore&lt;br /&gt;weak, or it has somehow been watered down or forged and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever is going on with it, it barely smells like Photo at all.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it was indeed a deal too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was quick, and it LOOKS like a new, sealed bottle, but when sprayed,&lt;br /&gt;you about have to stick a nostril directly on it to smell anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY not like regular Photo!!  The real thing can be smelled very clearly and you don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;to be super close. Even after a direct spray and sniff, almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Something is very wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld Photo is an amazing scent that smells fantastic on men.&lt;br /&gt;We used to purchase ours at Dillards, but no longer live near a mall.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle I received (and apparently others as well) purchased from THIS listing&lt;br /&gt;barely resembles the Photo scent. If I was blindfolded and asked to identify the scent,&lt;br /&gt;I would wonder if someone was kidding with me - yes, it is that weak.&lt;br /&gt;On my rating - if it was based on this purchase alone, I would rate it one star.&lt;br /&gt;(Actually, less than one, but you can&#x27;t do half-stars.)&lt;br /&gt;If it was based on true fresh Photo spray, I would rate it a five.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I went with a two, because this is not a fresh product,&lt;br /&gt;and I feel a bit ripped off. It can&#x27;t be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE FOREWARNED:&lt;br /&gt;The regular Photo is fantastic, but what is being sold in THIS particular listing&lt;br /&gt;is either tampered with or older than dirt itself.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it someplace else if you want the true Photo scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 2011:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other places that Lagerfeld has changed the formulation on this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Why, I do not know. But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version, which&lt;br /&gt;is a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy it again.  Time to look for a new fragrance for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame that the company decided to mess with such a FORMERLY great product.what is being sold in THIS particular listing   is either tampered with or older than dirt itself.   Buy it someplace else if you want the true Photo scent.    UPDATE JULY 2011:  I&#x27;ve read other places that Lagerfeld has changed the formulation on this fragrance.   Why, I do not know. But, know that with this purchase, you will get the new version, which   is a weak watered-down substitute of the old one in the black box.   I&#x27;ll never buy it again.

            <li> Nice smell, but not very distinctive.  Smells like a few other colognes I got for my hubby; but still smelled nice.</li>
            <li> I use this once in a while, the wife likes it so what the heck. She had me try some high dollar stuff and I found it didn&#x27;t mix well with sweat. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not the cheap stuff either but it will not break the bank. (Between you and me, I got it for about 1/3 the price here on Amazon over any other shops...) Go ahead, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice mix of spice and wood scent, at least to me. I&#x27;m told it is an informal/casual sent, whatever that means...</li>
            <li> one of the packages rattled when it was delivered as it is a Christmas gift I have not opened the packaging.</li>
            <li> used a long time ago brings back memories of family and pets all of who I miss very much!</li>
            <li> Be cautious. I bought this cologne - which is sold and shipped by Amazon - and if it is not a counterfeit (I trust Amazon), it is expired. Its scent is weak and fades quickly. I am used to Lagerfeld&#x27;s Photo and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least. I bought four of them, and I wanted to return the three unopened ones. This is what Amazon tells me:    \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot;    Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around. This is odd, to say the least.</li>
            <li> I use this product as it should be used. So if you do not know how to use it donot invest your money as you need to seek advice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other people about this cologne. Its amazing and compliments after an other keep coming when I use this product. And I&#x27;m definitely coming back to purchase more! Fast delivery and the greatest shopping experience ever! See you soon!</li>
            <li> Love them smell. Hard item to find in the store. Always find a good price with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell you how many years this has been my favorite.  Manly, yet not over powering.  Use just a touch of spray and watch how many compliments you get through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Photo since 1991.  There&#x27;s not a scent that gets my wife worked up more this.  Plus, everyone always compliments how &#x27;clean&#x27; I smell when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I use it, sparsely, as an after-shave.  Does an excellent job. A trace of the smell, just a trace, lingers for hours.  From time to time strangers (usually women), like in an elevator, will  ask me for the name of the source of that smell.</li>
            <li> is of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m very pleased with the perfume. I hope to buy the coming year</li>
            <li> There is something definitely wrong with this product. Scent did not last long and smelt nothing like the original. I do recall that the lid on the original had a knurled look reminiscent of a camera body. This one does not. Caveat Emptor.</li>
            <li> Great price with a fast arrival time!</li>
            <li> Photo by Karl Lagerfeld and Kouros by YSL are the best EDT I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast shipping. Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells great on my husband.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for some photo cologne but this toilette works just as good. Looking for some chaps next. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because it was one of my favorite male calognes from the 90&#x27;s. I still had some left of the original so I could give it a comparison. This is not the same. It smells very close but does not have the staying power of the original. But because of the price it still was an OK purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this item for the past 20 years after reading about it in Playboy Magazine. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this cologne.  It is a great price for the size bottle and it is not always easily accessible to find in stores.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how strong the odor is though as compared to my previous purchasing this cologne from a store.  I don&#x27;t smell it as much, but have been told I smell good so others must be able to smell it.  All and all I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Of all the toilette I used, Photo by Lagerfeld is the only one I WOULD and STILL get compliments</li>
            <li> People who are saying this is a counterfeit or expired: it&#x27;s not. In the 1990s this cologne was indeed different. And yes, I can say this because I have a really old bottle of it with a tiny little bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a number of years ago, they changed the cologne to what it is now.  It&#x27;s no longer as... overpowering as it was before. You now need to use quite a few whiffs for the smell to stay with you through the day (the old Photo only required a few drops). The scent profile is more or less the same, but I believe the makers decided to forgo the more expensive ingredients to make for a cheaper cologne. Which brings us to the bottom line: it is now much cheaper than before. In the end, I think it was a good trade-off, so I can now wear Photo as my daily cologne without feeling I&#x27;m wearing an overpowering scent. It&#x27;s also uncommon to find any other guy that uses it, so it became my trademark.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a great Cologne for men. I use it on a regular basis and love it!!!</li>
            <li> el perfume muy bueno el costo muy económico lo recomiendo [[ASIN:B001CT09B8 Karl Lagerfeld Photo By Karl Lagerfeld For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend as a gift! They were thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this.  It hasn&#x27;t made me into a girl magnet yet, but I think that I smell better with it rather then what I smelled like without it, and no one has run away from me gagging yet!  I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.  The sprayer works fine.  What else do you want to know?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I always get tons of compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
            <li> The Cologne is great, been using it since its introduction in the 1990&#x27;s..........the shipping was great too....arrived on time as promised ...thumbs up</li>
            <li> I just love everything about this fantastic scent, it lingers on my skin all day long! It smells clean, intense and in my opinion very erotic! I get compliments of how nice I smell everywhere I go!</li>
            <li> I bought it because someone recommended that to me, but I have never tried. It&#x27;s still good, but I&#x27;d prefer something a little bit more Sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Every opinion is relative.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles and they were received promptly.  The packaging looked absolutely genuine and the bottles as well.  I have used Photo for the last ten years.  But the scent of the cologne was very faded.  It lasted few minutes only.  It may be that these bottles are from a very old production year.  They cannot be returned but I was disappointed.  The rating is for the bottle not for the seller.  But by this time, from this review and others, the seller should know that there is a problem with the product.</li>
            <li> Is the best for me!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is somewhat close to the original scent but it&#x27;s not as subtle or distinct.  It does last fairly long.</li>
            <li> I recommended for every day use. Clean ,Fresh! You will turn heads. Compared with other cologne I use  it is affordable and a great product !</li>
            <li> It is the only fragrance my husband likes.Everyone comments on how much they like the fragrance</li>
            <li> it was the real thing and cheaper than the stores have it. i would recommend it to all who need cologne</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years! It&#x27;s one of the few constants in my life and I intend to keep it in my en suite for years to come.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Photo and so do I - he smells good always.  A little and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean smell. Not over powering</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my husband in the past. When he ran out of his cologne, he gave me this bottle as a \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; of what to get when searching. I love the smell and it seems to last all day. Shipping was quick.</li>
