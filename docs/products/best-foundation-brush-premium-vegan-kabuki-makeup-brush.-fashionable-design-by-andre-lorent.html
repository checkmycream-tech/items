            <li>The price was fantastic and I am keeping it for myself instead of giving it away as a gift!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is great at absorbing powders and applying them to the skin.  </li>
            <li>say &amp;quot;a makeup brush is a makeup brush&amp;quot; I disagree, having been a Cosmetologist for many years.</li>
            <li>well making it easier, in my opinion, to apply makeup with more even strokes.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on my makeup this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles are beautifully shaped and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and works great.</li>
            <li>Good for foundation or gentle blush.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>non-shedding and easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This fabulous brush is soft, dense, and gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable in my hand, the brush itself is very luxurious, the fibers are very soft and my make-up glides on beautifully!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush again and again for an easy, beautiful air brushed finish to your make up routine.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how it holds up to that, but I feel like it will be good as new.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth finish &amp; blends so easily.</li>
            <li>but I found it to be comfortable and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li>Love the size as I  can  take it with me for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>It is super soft and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li>It looked so smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and evenly.  </li>
            <li>It applies all products I have used it for smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>made- not one of those cheap brushes that the handle comes out of the metal holder.  </li>
            <li>and that is important to me.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and there is no fall out.</li>
            <li>You can tell they are a small company, and have great communication and want to make sure you&#x27;re fully satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li>The Professional Kabuki Brush impressed me first with its classy look.</li>
            <li>I am super excited about adding this to my morning make up routine stash.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a little case or cover to keep it clean and keep the bristles nice.</li>
            <li>Makes putting on makeup easy with a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I have many other brushes, but this one is becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li>High quality and I LOVE that it is Vegan.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I use it for foundation and notice I use much less product because the brush is so great.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the kabuki brush, and have to tell you I love it!  </li>
            <li>I got this at a special price to review, but I really do like it!</li>
            <li>The weight of the brush is good because it&#x27;s neither too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li>It is lovely to look at, and feels INCREDIBLY soft.  </li>
            <li>So far it is way better than my Mary Kay brushes.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love is how soft the bristles are and they do NOT come out.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft this brush is and how lovely it felt on my face.  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>My 4-year-old likes to &amp;#34;put on makeup&amp;#34; with me when I&#x27;m  getting ready in the morning, and she calls this new one &amp;#34;the cloud brush&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much, I threw away my old kabuki brush that I bought from Sephora and now use this brush instead!</li>
            <li>Soft enough to make you feel like you are taking care of the gorgeous skin of your youth.</li>
            <li>Some of my brushes have to go back in the powder so many times before i can get the coverage I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Kabuki brushes before and are often let down by the shedding and they never quite give me that perfect airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>Amazing, soft, would definitely recommend this make-up brush!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it because the handle is much longer than the brushes I currently use.  </li>
            <li>The handle is long, giving you more control when applying your foundation.</li>
            <li>The brush is lush and full.  </li>
            <li>With its super soft feel and</li>
            <li>The texture of the bristles are super soft,,</li>
            <li>Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush-Vegan makeup brush allows for smooth continuous strokes or gradual highlights depending on you preference as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of the Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush, I noticed the finished work it gave me was very pleasing and will continue using it, in fact I wasn&#x27;t the only one who noticed.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and very plush.  </li>
            <li>I like that the tip of the brush is white so that it is easy to tell how much product is on the brush.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be very high quality and is very dense.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It actually did such a fantastic job of spreading it out so even, so smooth.</li>
            <li>This really amazed me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on much smoother than using a sponge, your fingers, or even a beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>The brush works very well.</li>
            <li>Will be helpful with foundation as I feel like it&#x27;s not going to absorb much and be wasteful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add it to my professional makeup kit right away.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was is it is so very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a brush you will love, and it will undoubtedly replace any other kabuki brush you have been using.</li>
            <li>It applies the makeup so smoothly that I will likely end up using less, but with better results.  </li>
            <li>Now when I first opened it I thought this is never going to apply makeup, it is way to soft to apply.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this one again (at full price) .</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone in the market for a new/better make-up brush, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>Because of its silky softness, I was skeptical that it would apply liquid foundation, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Well I am happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick brush that applies well with mineral make up.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little pricey at first, but now that I actually have it and have been using it for about a week, I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Then a few years back I got a horse hair brush and liked it-</li>
            <li>Very soft and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft &amp; short, so it seems to hold the right amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and provides even coverage!</li>
            <li>Soft bristles!  </li>
            <li>I usually do not splurge on makeup brushes...</li>
            <li>The entire handle appears large</li>
            <li>I did a little pull test to see how secure the fibers were-</li>
            <li>I have never been fussy about my brushes and such, as long as they were clean and applied my makeup.</li>
            <li>Now my old brushes are retired.</li>
            <li>it is just so soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for nearly a week</li>
            <li>It is so soft and applies my blush evenly.</li>
            <li>It was also soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft and plush.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>So soft and so natural looking.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the brush are so soft...</li>
            <li>both being applied evenly with a natural finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small brush which makes it easy to carry in make up bag.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush because of all the above mentioned features and believe you will too.</li>
            <li>Mine is very short handled and the actual brush is much fuller than this one.  </li>
            <li>But the major selling point for me is the gentleness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I like the short handle of the brush and the bristles are so soft and help the powder to go on evenly.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and I like the white handle.</li>
            <li>My first impression was how pretty this brush was, really love the copper base.  </li>
            <li>The  bristles are soft and flexible, not stiff and rough like some of my brushes.  </li>
            <li>The Bristol&#x27;s are thick and soft, definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I noticed first time how little foundation powder I needed to use.</li>
            <li>It is also very soft and I use it for loose powder.  </li>
            <li>Has not lost a single bristle so far</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not very stiff, so I use another one for blush  or contouring, but this one is perfect for powder and leaves a soft, flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The price was fantastic and I am keeping it for myself instead of giving it away as a gift!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great at absorbing powders and applying them to the skin.  </li>
            <li> say &amp;quot;a makeup brush is a makeup brush&amp;quot; I disagree, having been a Cosmetologist for many years.</li>
            <li> well making it easier, in my opinion, to apply makeup with more even strokes.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on my makeup this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are beautifully shaped and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and works great.</li>
            <li> Good for foundation or gentle blush.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> non-shedding and easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This fabulous brush is soft, dense, and gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li> It feels comfortable in my hand, the brush itself is very luxurious, the fibers are very soft and my make-up glides on beautifully!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush again and again for an easy, beautiful air brushed finish to your make up routine.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how it holds up to that, but I feel like it will be good as new.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth finish &amp; blends so easily.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be comfortable and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li> Love the size as I  can  take it with me for quick touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> It is super soft and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li> It looked so smooth and even.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and evenly.  </li>
            <li> It applies all products I have used it for smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> made- not one of those cheap brushes that the handle comes out of the metal holder.  </li>
            <li> and that is important to me.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and there is no fall out.</li>
            <li> You can tell they are a small company, and have great communication and want to make sure you&#x27;re fully satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> The Professional Kabuki Brush impressed me first with its classy look.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about adding this to my morning make up routine stash.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a little case or cover to keep it clean and keep the bristles nice.</li>
            <li> Makes putting on makeup easy with a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I have many other brushes, but this one is becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li> High quality and I LOVE that it is Vegan.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I use it for foundation and notice I use much less product because the brush is so great.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the kabuki brush, and have to tell you I love it!  </li>
            <li> I got this at a special price to review, but I really do like it!</li>
            <li> The weight of the brush is good because it&#x27;s neither too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li> It is lovely to look at, and feels INCREDIBLY soft.  </li>
            <li> So far it is way better than my Mary Kay brushes.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love is how soft the bristles are and they do NOT come out.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how soft this brush is and how lovely it felt on my face.  </li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old likes to &amp;#34;put on makeup&amp;#34; with me when I&#x27;m  getting ready in the morning, and she calls this new one &amp;#34;the cloud brush&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much, I threw away my old kabuki brush that I bought from Sephora and now use this brush instead!</li>
            <li> Soft enough to make you feel like you are taking care of the gorgeous skin of your youth.</li>
            <li> Some of my brushes have to go back in the powder so many times before i can get the coverage I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Kabuki brushes before and are often let down by the shedding and they never quite give me that perfect airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> Amazing, soft, would definitely recommend this make-up brush!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it because the handle is much longer than the brushes I currently use.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long, giving you more control when applying your foundation.</li>
            <li> The brush is lush and full.  </li>
            <li> With its super soft feel and</li>
            <li> The texture of the bristles are super soft,,</li>
            <li> Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush-Vegan makeup brush allows for smooth continuous strokes or gradual highlights depending on you preference as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of the Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush, I noticed the finished work it gave me was very pleasing and will continue using it, in fact I wasn&#x27;t the only one who noticed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and very plush.  </li>
            <li> I like that the tip of the brush is white so that it is easy to tell how much product is on the brush.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be very high quality and is very dense.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It actually did such a fantastic job of spreading it out so even, so smooth.</li>
            <li> This really amazed me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Foundation goes on much smoother than using a sponge, your fingers, or even a beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> The brush works very well.</li>
            <li> Will be helpful with foundation as I feel like it&#x27;s not going to absorb much and be wasteful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add it to my professional makeup kit right away.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was is it is so very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a brush you will love, and it will undoubtedly replace any other kabuki brush you have been using.</li>
            <li> It applies the makeup so smoothly that I will likely end up using less, but with better results.  </li>
            <li> Now when I first opened it I thought this is never going to apply makeup, it is way to soft to apply.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this one again (at full price) .</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone in the market for a new/better make-up brush, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Because of its silky softness, I was skeptical that it would apply liquid foundation, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Well I am happy to say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick brush that applies well with mineral make up.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey at first, but now that I actually have it and have been using it for about a week, I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Then a few years back I got a horse hair brush and liked it-</li>
            <li> Very soft and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft &amp; short, so it seems to hold the right amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and provides even coverage!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles!  </li>
            <li> I usually do not splurge on makeup brushes...</li>
            <li> The entire handle appears large</li>
            <li> I did a little pull test to see how secure the fibers were-</li>
            <li> I have never been fussy about my brushes and such, as long as they were clean and applied my makeup.</li>
            <li> Now my old brushes are retired.</li>
            <li> it is just so soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for nearly a week</li>
            <li> It is so soft and applies my blush evenly.</li>
            <li> It was also soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and plush.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> So soft and so natural looking.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush are so soft...</li>
            <li> both being applied evenly with a natural finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small brush which makes it easy to carry in make up bag.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush because of all the above mentioned features and believe you will too.</li>
            <li> Mine is very short handled and the actual brush is much fuller than this one.  </li>
            <li> But the major selling point for me is the gentleness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the short handle of the brush and the bristles are so soft and help the powder to go on evenly.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and I like the white handle.</li>
            <li> My first impression was how pretty this brush was, really love the copper base.  </li>
            <li> The  bristles are soft and flexible, not stiff and rough like some of my brushes.  </li>
            <li> The Bristol&#x27;s are thick and soft, definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I noticed first time how little foundation powder I needed to use.</li>
            <li> It is also very soft and I use it for loose powder.  </li>
            <li> Has not lost a single bristle so far</li>
            <li> A couple swirls in bronzer is all it takes to complete the task, unlike a lot of other brushes where you have to return to the bronzer/foundation over and over to get proper</li>
            <li> I go the long handle and wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the short handle too.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had wondered how easy it was to use a Kabuki brush for foundation and was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased from the manufacturer and it will certainly not be the last.  </li>
            <li> and I like the long handle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased brushes which are much more expensive than this one which do not even compare!</li>
            <li> , I imagine I will be using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for loose powder and for blush,  </li>
            <li> It blends bb cream, foundation and concealer evenly,it definitely cut my make up time in half.</li>
            <li> This brush was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing the set for my other make up needs.</li>
            <li> I used it as a replacement for my blush brush and it looks like i will be replacing other of my brushes wit ones from this company</li>
            <li> Often times with other brushes, the hairs fall out a lot.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to apply the foundation, but not so firm that they hurt to stipple with.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to the brush is that it is a little stiff.  </li>
            <li> Now a small amount goes a long ways, it just takes it and spreads spreads spreads.</li>
            <li> It is packed quite tightly.  </li>
            <li> It has been the missing piece to my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Provides a smooth base finish.</li>

            <li> I like the short handle of the brush and the bristles are so soft and help the powder to go on evenly.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Soft bristles and provides even coverage!</li>
            <li> I received this brush at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  The brush arrived on time and us perfect for applying powder make up. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> The Professional Kabuki Brush impressed me first with its classy look. I can see the wisdom of the short handle allowing closer control of the brush itself.  But the major selling point for me is the gentleness of the bristles. Soft enough to make you feel like you are taking care of the gorgeous skin of your youth.</li>
            <li> Works well for blending. Feels expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love the shorter handle.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Makes my foundation smooth and flawless. It&#x27;s a must have for all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> The brush arrived promptly and was packaged appropriately.  It is lovely to look at, and feels INCREDIBLY soft.  Because of its silky softness, I was skeptical that it would apply liquid foundation, but it does a great job.  It applies the makeup so smoothly that I will likely end up using less, but with better results.  It also works well with powdered mineral makeup.  The brush seems well-constructed, and I have not seen any bristles falling out.  This is a brush you will love, and it will undoubtedly replace any other kabuki brush you have been using.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it. I&#x27;ve tried other Kabuki brushes before and are often let down by the shedding and they never quite give me that perfect airbrushed look. I did not have that problem with this brush! It is built to perfection. With its super soft feel and convent long handle you cant go wrong ordering this brush. It has been the missing piece to my makeup collection. I will definitely be recommending this brush to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Use it for my blush/bronzer. It gives a smooth finish &amp; blends so easily. Will be purchasing the set for my other make up needs.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a REALLY nice makeup brush! Almost feels to nice to use! Its elegant with a rose gold handle, and the bristles are cut at an upward angle to ensure smooth even application. An excellent makeup brush!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Excellently made brush.  Packed full of bristles with good flex.  Handle is comfortable and feels good in your hand.  Good for foundation or gentle blush.  Definitely more than one or a set would be a must!  Provides a smooth base finish.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush I&#x27;ve used. Flawless, even makeup. No brush lines. I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! Soft bristles!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> The brush is lush and full.  Spreads makeup evenly.  It is a ntce compact size.  East to carry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small brush which makes it easy to carry in make up bag. The Bristol&#x27;s are thick and soft, definitely worth the purchase. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received the Premium Kabuki Brush in the mail about a week ago. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it because the handle is much longer than the brushes I currently use.  This brush is amazing!  The long handle enables you to have better control while providing excellent coverage and a smooth flawless look.  The  bristles are soft and flexible, not stiff and rough like some of my brushes.  This is the second product I have purchased from the manufacturer and it will certainly not be the last.  This is a superb quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Luv this brush...I used it as a replacement for my blush brush and it looks like i will be replacing other of my brushes wit ones from this company Thanks</li>
            <li> This brush was everything I expected. It is well made, soft , easy to use, my makeup went on flawlessly. I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Nice and thick brush that applies well with mineral make up.</li>
            <li> I am not one to wear make up like an artist applied it to my face. I have never been fussy about my brushes and such, as long as they were clean and applied my makeup. Then a few years back I got a horse hair brush and liked it- I have been using it for years with no complaints. But I have to tell you. I just bought the Kabuki Brush and I am in love.Now my old brushes are retired. First thing I noticed was is it is so very soft. Now when I first opened it I thought this is never going to apply makeup, it is way to soft to apply. Well I am happy to say I was wrong. It actually did such a fantastic job of spreading it out so even, so smooth.It is like air brushed,I kid you not. It looked so smooth and even. Now a small amount goes a long ways, it just takes it and spreads spreads spreads. I noticed first time how little foundation powder I needed to use. This really amazed me.&lt;br /&gt; I did a little pull test to see how secure the fibers were- well that test passed too. The quality of the brush is great. I absolutely love the feel of it on my face. It would be nice to have a little case or cover to keep it clean and keep the bristles nice. I love this brush and will recomment to all my friends</li>
            <li> I got this at a special price to review, but I really do like it! I use all powder makeup, so I have used a lot of brushes over the years. I would definitely purchase this one again (at full price) . It really is a great brush for applying powder foundation. It seems to be very high quality and is very dense. Some of my brushes have to go back in the powder so many times before i can get the coverage I need. Not this one! I have not washed it yet, so I cannot say how it holds up to that, but I feel like it will be good as new. I recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush it feels great against my skin my makeup covers so evenly, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d never tried using a brush before .&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would  suggest to everyone to try this brush</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic brush! I wanted to use this for a couple days before actually posting the review. I am super excited about adding this to my morning make up routine stash. The bristles are perfect and soft and it smoothly apply my powder and bronzer evenly. Yep- I use it for both my powder and bronzer! I love the way it feels as well- it is just so soft. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the kabuki brush, and have to tell you I love it!  it&#x27;s size is perfect, the bristles are soft and my bronzer just glides on my face.  I love this brush so much, I threw away my old kabuki brush that I bought from Sephora and now use this brush instead!</li>
            <li> I had wondered how easy it was to use a Kabuki brush for foundation and was a bit skeptical. I have never used a brush for foundation, although I would consider myself a brush snob.  Just not for foundation.  I have been using this brush for nearly a week and I am in love with it!  The bristles are firm enough to apply the foundation, but not so firm that they hurt to stipple with.  I have not had one strand fall out of the brush yet.  It is packed quite tightly.  Foundation goes on much smoother than using a sponge, your fingers, or even a beauty blender.  I would say I definitely have an &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; finish.  After applying the foundation, I also use the brush to add concentrated amounts of finishing powder to my skin.  It does a beautiful job with this as well.  I would recommend this brush again and again for an easy, beautiful air brushed finish to your make up routine.</li>
            <li> I was able to get myvAndre Lorent foundation brush at a discounted price. I am so glad I ordered it! It is a perfect brush for makeup. The weight of the brush is good because it&#x27;s neither too light or too heavy. The handle is long, giving you more control when applying your foundation. The bristles are soft &amp; short, so it seems to hold the right amount of makeup. It&#x27;s so well made, I imagine I will be using it for a very long time. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this brush!  The bristles are super soft and very plush.  A couple swirls in bronzer is all it takes to complete the task, unlike a lot of other brushes where you have to return to the bronzer/foundation over and over to get proper coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing it has vegan fibers is the topper!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this high-quality brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It is so soft and applies my blush evenly.</li>
            <li> This brush is beautifully crafted.  Makes putting on makeup easy with a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. So far it is way better than my Mary Kay brushes. It is soft and works great.</li>
            <li> Great make up brush...it&#x27;s a morning game changer! It has a perfect length handle and makes putting on blush much easier. I have many other brushes, but this one is becoming my favorite. Great design!</li>
            <li> The brush provided even coverage on my face (no streaks). It was also soft. I appreciate that no stray bristles from the brush were left on my face. The entire handle appears large but I found it to be comfortable and easy to manipulate. As a pet/animal owner I appreciate that this is a.vegan product!</li>
            <li> I have received my Kabuki brush.  It was delivered on time.  I love the brush.  I have been using it to apply powdered foundation.  It goes on smooth and evenly.  Best part is I do not have to use a lot of foundation as the brush spreads it evenly.  Another thing I love is how soft the bristles are and they do NOT come out.  Often times with other brushes, the hairs fall out a lot.  It is easy to handle and I absolutely love it.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I usually do not splurge on makeup brushes... but I am sure glad I did with this one!  The price was right so I thought I would try it and I LOVE IT!!  I would recommend it to anyone who will listen!!  I am now in the market for more Andre Lorent brushes!!  I want them all!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have had the oppourtunity to use this brush with mineral makeup (B.M. brand), finishing powder and traditional powder.  This brush is extremely soft and plush.  It applies all products I have used it for smoothly and evenly.  I purchased the short handled version of this brush.  It is ergonomic and well made- not one of those cheap brushes that the handle comes out of the metal holder.  Overall I am very satisfied with this brush.  I have purchased brushes which are much more expensive than this one which do not even compare!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ll add it to my professional makeup kit right away.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Incredibly soft. My 4-year-old likes to &amp;#34;put on makeup&amp;#34; with me when I&#x27;m  getting ready in the morning, and she calls this new one &amp;#34;the cloud brush&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very stiff, so I use another one for blush  or contouring, but this one is perfect for powder and leaves a soft, flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose gold accent is quite nice, and while I didn&#x27;t buy it for it&#x27;s looks, it&#x27;s a nice touch and it&#x27;s definitely my prettiest brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the customer service is excellent (should you ever need it for, um...a brush). You can tell they are a small company, and have great communication and want to make sure you&#x27;re fully satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> If you have RA I recommend this brush. It is light weight and easy to grasp.  Soft bristles and I like the white handle.</li>
            <li> Received the brush on Monday.  I&#x27;ve  used the brush  and am thrilled with it.  It is an easy to use kabuki brush.  Love the size as I  can  take it with me for quick touch-ups.  The brush is the best kabuki I&#x27;ve  ever owned.</li>
            <li> The brush is wonderful very soft</li>
            <li> This is not the picture of the brush I own.  Mine is very short handled and the actual brush is much fuller than this one.  I love it.  Has not lost a single bristle so far and that is important to me. It is also very soft and I use it for loose powder.  I thought it was a little pricey at first, but now that I actually have it and have been using it for about a week, I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I really love your product! It feels comfortable in my hand, the brush itself is very luxurious, the fibers are very soft and my make-up glides on beautifully! I would recommend it highly to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Amazing, soft, would definitely recommend this make-up brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I had never used a brush to apply my foundation before but this brush is amazing. So soft and so natural looking. Would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Today I received my Premium Kabuki Brush as promised. I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.The bristles of the brush are so soft...so relaxing to brush it across my face. I love the feel that the handle has in my hand...perfect size. The price was fantastic and I am keeping it for myself instead of giving it away as a gift! I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this brush. It is super soft and provides great coverage. The handle is easy to hold. I go the long handle and wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the short handle too.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush is great at absorbing powders and applying them to the skin.  I like that the tip of the brush is white so that it is easy to tell how much product is on the brush.  The only downside to the brush is that it is a little stiff.  Hopefully it will become softer over time and with use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Andre Lorent Premium Vegan Brush and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;Some say &amp;quot;a makeup brush is a makeup brush&amp;quot; I disagree, having been a Cosmetologist for many years. The Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki brush is Not just another makeup brush. The longer handle fits the hand well making it easier, in my opinion, to apply makeup with more even strokes. It&#x27;s a delight to use. The texture of the bristles are super soft,, non-shedding and easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush-Vegan makeup brush allows for smooth continuous strokes or gradual highlights depending on you preference as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of the Andre&#x27; Lorent Kabuki Brush, I noticed the finished work it gave me was very pleasing and will continue using it, in fact I wasn&#x27;t the only one who noticed. I received many compliments on my makeup this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush because of all the above mentioned features and believe you will too.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well. Very soft! Will be helpful with foundation as I feel like it&#x27;s not going to absorb much and be wasteful. Good product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kabuki brush!  My first impression was how pretty this brush was, really love the copper base.  The bristles are beautifully shaped and extremely soft.  I have been using this brush for loose powder and for blush,  both being applied evenly with a natural finish. I look forward to using more of their products!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brush you will ever buy!!! I use this brush for my blush and to contour my cheek bones. I have even coverage with out over applying my makeup. No brush streaks or harsh bristles.  Seriously awesome brush for the money</li>
            <li> I could not believe how soft this brush is and how lovely it felt on my face.  High quality and I LOVE that it is Vegan.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone in the market for a new/better make-up brush, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really nice makeup brush. Very soft and seems to be well made. Applies foundation evenly and I like the long handle. I am hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I&#x27;m very happy with it. The handle is comfortable and there is no fall out. It blends bb cream, foundation and concealer evenly,it definitely cut my make up time in half. I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This fabulous brush is soft, dense, and gives great coverage.  I use it for foundation and notice I use much less product because the brush is so great. I highly recommend it!</li>
