            <li>The zipper doesn&#x27;t work and the form factor doesn&#x27;t allow you to carry many items.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate it more and more.  </li>
            <li>Love the bag.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for several reasons</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the zipper assembly especially.</li>
            <li>love it.....bought it for tailgating....</li>
            <li>Great size and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it to the beach many times too and haven&#x27;t had sand inside at all.</li>
            <li>Many uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry my essential oils when I travel.</li>
            <li>This bag is OK.</li>
            <li>This pouch would serve better for cords and cables.  </li>
            <li>very nice.. smaller size but good to carry in a purse</li>
            <li>Great addition for the frequent traveler for your 3-ounce liquids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it, and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily as well.</li>
            <li>Just took it on vacation and it was so easy to use because I can see everything.</li>
            <li>The plastic is flexible and thick--but not the sort that cracks easily.</li>
            <li>No leak, strong vinyl.</li>
            <li>Excellent little carry all for toiletry items.</li>
            <li>so I would get free shipping</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The material is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but this could NOT be somebodys primary makeup bag.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and you can tell</li>
            <li>Worth the money , bought this for my copic markers it rocks ; exactally what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li>i just dont like the zipper because it has like a yellowy material, but its still good i like and is easy to clean and zanatary keepping your makeup save and your face clean and not accumaling germs from an old makeup bag you cannot wash .</li>
            <li>This cosmetic bag was exactly what I expected, it was described perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am very concerned with the very strong odor coming from bag.</li>
            <li>and I love the clear case/being able to see everything inside.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This little clear vinyl purse is the perfect cosmetic bag...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really fit much of substance in it and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I love the compact size and that it is clear so you can see what you&#x27;ve have in</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>As a bonus, for me, the little ball-chain loop that held the tag to the zipper works very nicely as a zipper-pull.  </li>
            <li>anyway in my old little bag i couldnt find anything and this bag is great, fits everything i need, can find eveything easy.</li>
            <li>This make up bag is just the right size to use in any purse.  </li>
            <li>just the right size for the makeup that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>Since it is clear objects can be easily located.</li>
            <li>It is clear so you can find what you need very quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be sooooooooooooo much more useful with a zipper that goes all the way to the back.</li>
            <li>Clear plastic all the way around is easy to see what is in the bag from all angles.  </li>
            <li>Clear vinyl makes it easy to find anything in the case.</li>
            <li>They fit well in this and the clear soft plastic makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li>I used a tinted see-through cosmetic bag for several years and then received a lovely bag as a gift and started using it, but I was always digging to find what I needed.  </li>
            <li>So you can&#x27;t flip the top open, you can only drop stuff into the top.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The picture provided looks like a higher quality than what I received.  </li>
            <li>Easy to find and take with me when I&#x27;m on the run...which is daily</li>
            <li>by simply looking through the plastic makes it easy to &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to see from the outside what I need to grab.</li>
            <li>I always carry a large purse with me</li>
            <li>it certainly does the trick...</li>
            <li>Nice little case that holds things and you can see what is in there, too.  </li>
            <li>Nice little plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>I use an old damp hand towel to clean my case inside and out whenever needed....and it looks like new in a jiff.  </li>
            <li>. . . recommend highly!</li>
            <li>if you buy pillow cases or sheets and get a protective package, then you basically have the same thing for free</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bag, really helps that it&#x27;s transparent.  </li>
            <li>it is real sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is not broken but seems as if it had been packed in a squished manner for years.</li>
            <li>I really like the bag that was pictured and this seems to be its replacement.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, Thanks</li>
            <li>Like many other women there&#x27;s nothing messier than make-up, lipstick, etc.</li>
            <li>The recorders can all be stored in the same drawer and since the pouches are clear,  we can easily see which recorder is in the pouch.</li>
            <li>Having thrown away the first bag, I ordered this clear one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, so you see exactly what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>Nice, well constructed, small for my needs, but as described.  </li>
            <li>If the zipper went farther down the sides allowing a wider opening, it would be better.</li>
            <li>Product does not smell new ,but has intense odor as if it was dipped in some type of chemical.</li>
            <li>Great thick plastic, not as big as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It quickly tore several  holes around the zipper.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for even photographers that are looking to put their triggers in a go bag.</li>
            <li>and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i thought it was a little better.  </li>
            <li>These clear vinyl bags are very well made.  </li>
            <li>Clear bag ready for airline travel.</li>
            <li>Zipper goes from the middle of one side across to the opposite side which makes it easy to reach into.</li>
            <li>I go right to what I&#x27;m looking for - specific lipstick, safety pin, mini perfume, mirror, mascara, eye drops .</li>
            <li>The one fault it has is that the zipper is not easy to close as the top bends inward.</li>
            <li>These small pouches are perfect as they are just a little bit bigger than the recorder.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted -- a little more space than my old one.  </li>
            <li>love this clear little bag.</li>
            <li>All the seams are solid, and it expanded from it&#x27;s squashed flat shipping form easily.</li>
            <li>The zipper failed on the old bag, and happily this zipper seems sturdier and is somewhat toothsome.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is small and cute...</li>
            <li>its about 7x4.5x2...perfect for my makeup necessities :) and after tailgating will be my everyday makeup bag!</li>
            <li>They giant stitching will rip the minute you look at it and the pull pulled off the first time I touched it.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, hard plastic.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s clear and kept all my small items consolidated in my travel bags.</li>
            <li>I was not able to fit enough in it to make it worth using.</li>
            <li>Large enough for all your travel needs.</li>
            <li>The zipper is a little cheap for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great makeup bag for anyone who wants to see what they have in their bad.</li>
            <li>Just a clear multi-purpose bag.</li>
            <li>I got a clear bag but not the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cosmetic bag to carry inside my clear tote bag to put money, lipstick, identification,  etc.</li>
            <li>and I like having the clear in order to see everything easier.  </li>
            <li>I like the &#x27;clear&#x27; because I can see what is where.</li>
            <li>Gave one to my officemate, and she threw out her old one immediately and switched all her makeup to this one.  </li>
            <li>so you can see everything you have &amp; how much you have left.</li>
            <li>So far works as advertised but the plastic doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;d withstand years of travel.</li>
            <li>odd i found this online since it&#x27;s the same cheap thing you can get anywhere at any drugstore.  </li>
            <li>And, I like that it&#x27;s clear, so that I can easily locate what I&#x27;m looking for - no more rummaging through my purse!</li>
            <li>Large enough to hold what I wanted and small enough to fit into my purse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to be the perfect size just for those items (it&#x27;s just slightly taller than a toiletry bottle and wide enough to stack in 2), so I can grab it and run to the shower without digging through my larger case of makeup &amp; hair products.</li>
            <li>to put inside my bigger clear vinyl raider bag!  </li>
            <li>However, unlike my old bag, this zipper does NOT go all the way to the back.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a bag small enough to fit in any of my purses but big enough to contact anything that might leak or stain (eye drops, cosmetics, lotion, etc.).</li>
            <li>First, the plastic is quite stiff and substantial--not at all flimsy as I had read in one review.</li>
            <li>it is very compact if you want a small clear purse size bag to carry around...</li>
            <li>Going to order a few more for small electronics like Nano, cords, etc</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;However, I love the compact size and that it is clear so you can see what you&#x27;ve have in</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> As a bonus, for me, the little ball-chain loop that held the tag to the zipper works very nicely as a zipper-pull.  </li>
            <li> anyway in my old little bag i couldnt find anything and this bag is great, fits everything i need, can find eveything easy.</li>
            <li> This make up bag is just the right size to use in any purse.  </li>
            <li> just the right size for the makeup that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Since it is clear objects can be easily located.</li>
            <li> It is clear so you can find what you need very quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be sooooooooooooo much more useful with a zipper that goes all the way to the back.</li>
            <li> Clear plastic all the way around is easy to see what is in the bag from all angles.  </li>
            <li> Clear vinyl makes it easy to find anything in the case.</li>
            <li> They fit well in this and the clear soft plastic makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li> I used a tinted see-through cosmetic bag for several years and then received a lovely bag as a gift and started using it, but I was always digging to find what I needed.  </li>
            <li> So you can&#x27;t flip the top open, you can only drop stuff into the top.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The picture provided looks like a higher quality than what I received.  </li>
            <li> Easy to find and take with me when I&#x27;m on the run...which is daily</li>
            <li> by simply looking through the plastic makes it easy to &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to see from the outside what I need to grab.</li>
            <li> I always carry a large purse with me</li>
            <li> it certainly does the trick...</li>
            <li> Nice little case that holds things and you can see what is in there, too.  </li>
            <li> Nice little plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> I use an old damp hand towel to clean my case inside and out whenever needed....and it looks like new in a jiff.  </li>
            <li> . . . recommend highly!</li>
            <li> if you buy pillow cases or sheets and get a protective package, then you basically have the same thing for free</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bag, really helps that it&#x27;s transparent.  </li>
            <li> it is real sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is not broken but seems as if it had been packed in a squished manner for years.</li>
            <li> I really like the bag that was pictured and this seems to be its replacement.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, Thanks</li>
            <li> Like many other women there&#x27;s nothing messier than make-up, lipstick, etc.</li>
            <li> The recorders can all be stored in the same drawer and since the pouches are clear,  we can easily see which recorder is in the pouch.</li>
            <li> Having thrown away the first bag, I ordered this clear one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, so you see exactly what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> Nice, well constructed, small for my needs, but as described.  </li>
            <li> If the zipper went farther down the sides allowing a wider opening, it would be better.</li>
            <li> Product does not smell new ,but has intense odor as if it was dipped in some type of chemical.</li>
            <li> Great thick plastic, not as big as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It quickly tore several  holes around the zipper.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for even photographers that are looking to put their triggers in a go bag.</li>
            <li> and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i thought it was a little better.  </li>
            <li> These clear vinyl bags are very well made.  </li>
            <li> Clear bag ready for airline travel.</li>
            <li> Zipper goes from the middle of one side across to the opposite side which makes it easy to reach into.</li>
            <li> I go right to what I&#x27;m looking for - specific lipstick, safety pin, mini perfume, mirror, mascara, eye drops .</li>
            <li> The one fault it has is that the zipper is not easy to close as the top bends inward.</li>
            <li> These small pouches are perfect as they are just a little bit bigger than the recorder.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted -- a little more space than my old one.  </li>
            <li> love this clear little bag.</li>
            <li> All the seams are solid, and it expanded from it&#x27;s squashed flat shipping form easily.</li>
            <li> The zipper failed on the old bag, and happily this zipper seems sturdier and is somewhat toothsome.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is small and cute...</li>
            <li> its about 7x4.5x2...perfect for my makeup necessities :) and after tailgating will be my everyday makeup bag!</li>
            <li> They giant stitching will rip the minute you look at it and the pull pulled off the first time I touched it.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s clear and kept all my small items consolidated in my travel bags.</li>
            <li> I was not able to fit enough in it to make it worth using.</li>
            <li> Large enough for all your travel needs.</li>
            <li> The zipper is a little cheap for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup bag for anyone who wants to see what they have in their bad.</li>
            <li> Just a clear multi-purpose bag.</li>
            <li> I got a clear bag but not the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cosmetic bag to carry inside my clear tote bag to put money, lipstick, identification,  etc.</li>
            <li> and I like having the clear in order to see everything easier.  </li>
            <li> I like the &#x27;clear&#x27; because I can see what is where.</li>
            <li> Gave one to my officemate, and she threw out her old one immediately and switched all her makeup to this one.  </li>
            <li> so you can see everything you have &amp; how much you have left.</li>
            <li> So far works as advertised but the plastic doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;d withstand years of travel.</li>
            <li> odd i found this online since it&#x27;s the same cheap thing you can get anywhere at any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> And, I like that it&#x27;s clear, so that I can easily locate what I&#x27;m looking for - no more rummaging through my purse!</li>
            <li> Large enough to hold what I wanted and small enough to fit into my purse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to be the perfect size just for those items (it&#x27;s just slightly taller than a toiletry bottle and wide enough to stack in 2), so I can grab it and run to the shower without digging through my larger case of makeup &amp; hair products.</li>
            <li> to put inside my bigger clear vinyl raider bag!  </li>
            <li> However, unlike my old bag, this zipper does NOT go all the way to the back.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a bag small enough to fit in any of my purses but big enough to contact anything that might leak or stain (eye drops, cosmetics, lotion, etc.).</li>
            <li> First, the plastic is quite stiff and substantial--not at all flimsy as I had read in one review.</li>
            <li> it is very compact if you want a small clear purse size bag to carry around...</li>
            <li> Going to order a few more for small electronics like Nano, cords, etc</li>
            <li> The zipper is weak, don&#x27;t pack full.</li>
            <li> Part of it is clear, but there&#x27;s also black and it&#x27;s much much bigger than what was listed.</li>
            <li> Needed a new cosmetic bag that would hold the products I use on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got the only lemon, but I&#x27;m not willing to chance a second one.</li>
            <li> We have a number of Olympus digital recorders that do not come with cases, and storing multiple recorders together can lead to scratches, dents and other damage.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long if ever it will soften up and become pliable.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Small enough for carry on luggage but big enough for all the essentials.</li>
            <li> The problem with the thick, stiff plastic, however, is that the first time I tried to zip the bag, the zipper split open (and, no, it wasn&#x27;t overfilled).</li>
            <li> The plastic is flimsy the design stinks as you cannot zip the dang thing open or closed easily.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a previous airline 1 quart bag of the same shape.  </li>
            <li> A little larger than I was hoping for (to go inside a medium-sized purse).  </li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t that tall or wide.</li>
            <li> Not much to say after all it is just a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I can still check the time on my phone through it without getting it wet.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the quality I expected.  </li>
            <li> When this was stored at the warehouse, it must have been unevenly squished flat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too big or too small and the zipper isn&#x27;t flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> and I will never use any other material.  </li>
            <li> Truly, this might just go in the garbage because i am not sure it would make sense to send it back.</li>
            <li> it hard to zip back up when holding my daughter.  </li>
            <li> so I can just pull it out and see everything instead of fishing around in the dark purse.</li>
            <li> that falls all over your purse and leaves a mess.  </li>
            <li> Seams appear tight should anything leak.</li>
            <li> Returning this little bag.</li>
            <li> so i had a little bag, and it was damaging my makeup brush.</li>
            <li> I usually keep travel sized shampoo, conditioner and other spill-able items in one of these bags and my make up in another.  </li>
            <li> I put all the little stuff in there</li>
            <li> Purchased this to house all my little travel-size toiletries for the shower for a 2 week vacation.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very disappointed with my purchase, defiantly not as nice as the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> Amazon has already sent me an email letting me know that my credit card was not charged and will not be charged for this order, so at least I didn&#x27;t loose any money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy plastic, so it can withstand the shoving it gets in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> Serviceable for a few items.</li>
            <li> I would like this case if it wasn&#x27;t so stiff and narrow.  </li>
            <li> I wanted them to be in plain sight, but organized.</li>
            <li> For the price and &amp;#34;ease-ability&amp;#34; of finding my small nail cutter, tweezers, little baby aspirins box, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but apparently my packaging doesn&#x27;t agree with this small size.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some small travel bags and this one did the trick.  </li>
            <li> Totally too expensive for what I got .</li>
            <li> So, I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these small pouches, not for cosmetics, but as cases for small recorders that we use in our language lab.</li>
            <li> no more losing hair clips or digging around for lip gloss--i even keep my reading cheaters in there.  </li>
            <li> It cannot be formed to it&#x27;s expected shape and has stiff wrinkles making it difficult to fill.</li>
            <li> Zipper is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Plastic is hard.</li>
            <li> Very small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put a few random things in it and keep things organized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expandable, so you can have it as thin or as thick as you need it.  </li>
            <li> The zipper is very hard to operate.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little stiffer than I&#x27;d like, which makes it just slightly inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> The plastic is hard and the zipper is twisted.</li>
            <li> The zipper on mine came broken</li>
            <li> Tired of washing, throwing out, etc.</li>
            <li> I am rarely disappointed with an Amazon purchase but this case arrived with the zipper open and it was curled inward and the very stiff vinyl made it impossible to zip.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> but it was a wrong purchase.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this seller.  </li>
            <li> Horrible odor!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this to put a few random things in it and keep things organized.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too big or too small and the zipper isn&#x27;t flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice, well constructed, small for my needs, but as described.  If you&#x27;re not a traveling hoarder, as I am, you will be happy with this bag.</li>
            <li> I always carry a large purse with me and I purchased this to put smaller items in so they don&#x27;t get lost and stay organized.  I bought it about a year ago and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> The container that arrived looked nothing like the photo.  Part of it is clear, but there&#x27;s also black and it&#x27;s much much bigger than what was listed.</li>
            <li> Returning this little bag. First, the plastic is quite stiff and substantial--not at all flimsy as I had read in one review. Maybe the material changed. The problem with the thick, stiff plastic, however, is that the first time I tried to zip the bag, the zipper split open (and, no, it wasn&#x27;t overfilled). Maybe I got the only lemon, but I&#x27;m not willing to chance a second one.</li>
            <li> Aweful. The zipper doesn&#x27;t work and the form factor doesn&#x27;t allow you to carry many items. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This little clear vinyl purse is the perfect cosmetic bag...it certainly does the trick...finally I can see all of my lipsticks, eyeliners, etc...all the essentials...&amp; it&#x27;s a great size...fits in a smaller purse...a good purchase...</li>
            <li> This is not the item I ordered...I ended up with another vinyl case that has a hook and net compartment.  Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Great thick plastic, not as big as i thought it would be. The zipper is a little cheap for the price. I like it ok but I would not have paid 7 dollars for this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bag for over a month and I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate it more and more.  I used a tinted see-through cosmetic bag for several years and then received a lovely bag as a gift and started using it, but I was always digging to find what I needed.  Having thrown away the first bag, I ordered this clear one and I will never use any other material.  I go right to what I&#x27;m looking for - specific lipstick, safety pin, mini perfume, mirror, mascara, eye drops . . . . recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Perfect size for a travel case. Great price. Large enough for all your travel needs.</li>
            <li> Nice little case that holds things and you can see what is in there, too.  Going to order a few more for small electronics like Nano, cords, etc</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my oil blotting sheets, my chapstick, compact, and bobby pins and it makes it easier to find things since it&#x27;s see-through.</li>
            <li> Just a clear multi-purpose bag. I use it to hold all my mobile related items-charger,card and  cords both at home and while traveling. Keeps everything where I can find it.</li>
            <li> Vinyl Cosmetic bag was just as described &amp; arrived in plenty of time for the holidays!  Thank you for the easy/fast order.  Pamela</li>
            <li> It works good. I carry my make up items and some meds in this in my purse. No leak, strong vinyl. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the bag. I&#x27;m using for my scrapbooking</li>
            <li> I was looking for some small travel bags and this one did the trick.  Love the fact that it&#x27;s clear and kept all my small items consolidated in my travel bags.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected. Plastic is rigid and the item came flattened. It cannot be formed to it&#x27;s expected shape and has stiff wrinkles making it difficult to fill.</li>
            <li> This bag is so neat!  It&#x27;s heavy plastic, so it can withstand the shoving it gets in my purse.  It&#x27;s clear, so you see exactly what you are looking for.  It&#x27;s expandable, so you can have it as thin or as thick as you need it.  Gave one to my officemate, and she threw out her old one immediately and switched all her makeup to this one.  Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;better than i thought&lt;br /&gt;but it should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag was exactly what I expected, it was described perfectly.  It also arrived very quickly.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> another cosmetic bag.  odd i found this online since it&#x27;s the same cheap thing you can get anywhere at any drugstore.  i thought it was a little better.  oops.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I was hoping for (to go inside a medium-sized purse).  Nice way to keep makeup together in your purse.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size for anyone looking to keep either their medications together, or their diabetic supplies, or cosmetics.  This is perfect for several reasons one is that you can see what is in the package.  Highly recommend this for even photographers that are looking to put their triggers in a go bag.</li>
            <li> These clear vinyl bags are very well made.  I was impressed with the zipper assembly especially. The product is well made and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I got a clear bag but not the one in the picture. I got one somewhat bigger, see picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cosmetic bag to carry inside my clear tote bag to put money, lipstick, identification,  etc. to carry into athletic arenas.</li>
            <li> This case is exactly what I wanted to hold small crocheting supplies.  Since it is clear objects can be easily located. The one fault it has is that the zipper is not easy to close as the top bends inward.</li>
            <li> so i had a little bag, and it was damaging my makeup brush. heck i payed $3 for my brush but i still want to take care of it. anyway in my old little bag i couldnt find anything and this bag is great, fits everything i need, can find eveything easy. i just dont like the zipper because it has like a yellowy material, but its still good i like and is easy to clean and zanatary keepping your makeup save and your face clean and not accumaling germs from an old makeup bag you cannot wash . buy it! lol</li>
            <li> I would like this case if it wasn&#x27;t so stiff and narrow.  Doesn&#x27;t really fit much of substance in it and it hard to zip back up when holding my daughter.  I use it for my makeup at the house instead of a diaper bag organizer.</li>
            <li> Totally too expensive for what I got . I could have got it at the dollar store for 50 cents.  lol !!!&lt;br /&gt;I chose it to bring the price of my purchase up so I would get free shipping but it was a wrong purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent make up bag.  It&#x27;s see through so you can tell what you have in the bag.  Having a bag like this is a great idea for when you travel.  I usually keep travel sized shampoo, conditioner and other spill-able items in one of these bags and my make up in another.  When you aren&#x27;t traveling they&#x27;re a great way to keep everything together for when you need it!</li>
            <li> lightweight, great size, transparency is helpful.</li>
            <li> Zipper is hard to use. Plastic is hard. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Terrific to keep all your different pens and/or pencils. Holds a lot!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to organize nail clippers, file, tweezers, scissors, etc. in our tiny bathroom. I wanted them to be in plain sight, but organized. The material is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great addition for the frequent traveler for your 3-ounce liquids.  Have taken it through TSA screenings 20 times without question.</li>
            <li> if you buy pillow cases or sheets and get a protective package, then you basically have the same thing for free</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be a tad bigger. it can fit dollar bills length wise with spare room but it isn&#x27;t that tall or wide. it will be good for just my emergency makeup (foundation and what not) but this could NOT be somebodys primary makeup bag.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little stiffer than I&#x27;d like, which makes it just slightly inconvenient to use. If the zipper went farther down the sides allowing a wider opening, it would be better.</li>
            <li> I keep all of my purse things in here-- so I can just pull it out and see everything instead of fishing around in the dark purse.</li>
            <li> This make up bag is just the right size to use in any purse.  It is clear so you can find what you need very quickly.  Appears durable as well.</li>
            <li> very nice.. smaller size but good to carry in a purse I like it</li>
            <li> This clear carry case is perfect for what I needed and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I brought this item...it is very compact if you want a small clear purse size bag to carry around...I like it because it is small and cute...I would recommend this bag...</li>
            <li> love it.....bought it for tailgating....to put inside my bigger clear vinyl raider bag!  its about 7x4.5x2...perfect for my makeup necessities :) and after tailgating will be my everyday makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on 5/20/10.  At that time, the item was listed as being in stock.  Today (5/26/10), I was notified by the seller Cosmetic Solutions that the item was out of stock and would not be in stock anytime soon, so they were canceling my order.  I just looked, and the item is still listed by Cosmetic Solutions on Amazon.com as being for sale and in stock.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this seller.  Amazon has already sent me an email letting me know that my credit card was not charged and will not be charged for this order, so at least I didn&#x27;t loose any money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but apparently my packaging doesn&#x27;t agree with this small size. It&#x27;s good for carrying lipstick and mascara though. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another so I can have one for face products and one for eye/lip products.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and does the job. Seems to be a good quality plastic and I like having the clear in order to see everything easier.  Not much to say after all it is just a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a previous airline 1 quart bag of the same shape.  The zipper failed on the old bag, and happily this zipper seems sturdier and is somewhat toothsome.  However, unlike my old bag, this zipper does NOT go all the way to the back.  So you can&#x27;t flip the top open, you can only drop stuff into the top.  So, I was pretty disappointed.  I wish I had another bag.  I only kept it because it was only five dollars and was an add on item. so I would have had to pay return shipping.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it, and it was cheap.  But I still want a different one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be sooooooooooooo much more useful with a zipper that goes all the way to the back.</li>
            <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used this yet because its for a trip that I will be making in September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love the compact size and that it is clear so you can see what you&#x27;ve have in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can even store your sewing supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have two [2] of them for the reasons stated above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go \\&quot;Amazing-zon\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> I wanted a bag small enough to fit in any of my purses but big enough to contact anything that might leak or stain (eye drops, cosmetics, lotion, etc.). This bag holds a lot without taking up a lot of room! And, I like that it&#x27;s clear, so that I can easily locate what I&#x27;m looking for - no more rummaging through my purse!</li>
            <li> Great size and I love the clear case/being able to see everything inside.  Cleans easily as well.</li>
            <li> Great size and seems to be very sturdy. Just took it on vacation and it was so easy to use because I can see everything. It held a lot of stuff. I&#x27;ll probably order another one or two!</li>
            <li> When this was stored at the warehouse, it must have been unevenly squished flat.  It is permanently misshapen.  It is a pain to zip/unzip.</li>
            <li> I purchased these small pouches, not for cosmetics, but as cases for small recorders that we use in our language lab. We have a number of Olympus digital recorders that do not come with cases, and storing multiple recorders together can lead to scratches, dents and other damage. These small pouches are perfect as they are just a little bit bigger than the recorder. The recorders can all be stored in the same drawer and since the pouches are clear,  we can easily see which recorder is in the pouch. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> USED IT AS PS VITA CASE! LIKE A BOSS!&lt;br /&gt;IGNORE THESE NEXT LINES:&lt;br /&gt;DF FD FDF DF DF DF DV</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy plastic and good zipper.  Size as indicated.  Horrible odor!  Left it outside and still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The zipper on mine came broken it&#x27;s cheap and you can tell, I&#x27;m very disappointed with my purchase, defiantly not as nice as the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> I am rarely disappointed with an Amazon purchase but this case arrived with the zipper open and it was curled inward and the very stiff vinyl made it impossible to zip.  Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> Great for travelling.  Zipper broke after a while. Wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This is a robust carry-all for your tubes and bottles while travelling. The plastic is flexible and thick--but not the sort that cracks easily. Much, much better than using a ziploc bag! My only gripe is the zip material itself which is yellowish and makes the bag look somewhat old/shabby.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Durable too. Zipper is holding up! I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> perfect size for my makeup..fits nicely in my pocketbook. Easy to find and take with me when I&#x27;m on the run...which is daily</li>
            <li> Nice little plastic bag.  Good size for what I need. Clear plastic all the way around is easy to see what is in the bag from all angles.  Seems to be fairly well made.  Will have to see how the zipper joint holds up over time.</li>
            <li> just the right size for the makeup that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for holding my phone and keys in my pool bag. I can still check the time on my phone through it without getting it wet. I&#x27;ve taken it to the beach many times too and haven&#x27;t had sand inside at all.</li>
            <li> Clear bag ready for airline travel. Small enough for carry on luggage but big enough for all the essentials. As stated on the listing. Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Needed a new cosmetic bag that would hold the products I use on an everyday basis. They fit well in this and the clear soft plastic makes it easy to find things. Zipper goes from the middle of one side across to the opposite side which makes it easy to reach into. Didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot and needed a medium size. Works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bag, really helps that it&#x27;s transparent.  I use it for hair supplies so I can see what I have.  No complaints and it is real sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup bag for anyone who wants to see what they have in their bad. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The plastic is hard and the zipper is twisted. It is not broken but seems as if it had been packed in a squished manner for years. Don&#x27;t know how long if ever it will soften up and become pliable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome ! Worth the money , bought this for my copic markers it rocks ; exactally what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li> Like many other women there&#x27;s nothing messier than make-up, lipstick, etc. that falls all over your purse and leaves a mess.  Tired of washing, throwing out, etc. cloth satchels... I tried every drug store and &amp;#34;major retailers&amp;#34; etc, until......finally.....Amazon!  For the price and &amp;#34;ease-ability&amp;#34; of finding my small nail cutter, tweezers, little baby aspirins box, etc. by simply looking through the plastic makes it easy to &amp;#34;dig in&amp;#34;. I now can always &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; when something is running short or the lipstick flipped open - without having to dump out everything.  I use an old damp hand towel to clean my case inside and out whenever needed....and it looks like new in a jiff.  Pliable. The 2 I bought I purchased months ago.  Both holding up great even under my car seat in Summer and Winter.</li>
            <li> Not happy! I am very concerned with the very strong odor coming from bag.I will  seal it in a ziploc bag and place in a locked away container in my fridge and see what happens.Truly, this might just go in the garbage because i am not sure it would make sense to send it back.Product does not smell new ,but has intense odor as if it was dipped in some type of chemical.Save your money with this one..</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest most useless piece of junk ever. The plastic is flimsy the design stinks as you cannot zip the dang thing open or closed easily. They giant stitching will rip the minute you look at it and the pull pulled off the first time I touched it.</li>
            <li> The bag pictured here is not what is pictured on the sale page. I really like the bag that was pictured and this seems to be its replacement. Please update!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year to keep all my purse organized. I put all the little stuff in there and it&#x27;s easy to see from the outside what I need to grab.</li>
            <li> Excellent little carry all for toiletry items. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It&#x27;s the perfect size for all of my things defiantly recommend this</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed: a supplemental toiletries case big enough to carry my brush, toothbrush, full-size deodorant, and a handful of powder cosmetics.  My &amp;#34;liquids and gels&amp;#34; bag for air-travel isn&#x27;t big enough to hold everything, and if it were it would be a pain to haul in and out of my luggage.  This works perfectly to carry everything that TSA won&#x27;t have hissy-fits over.  As a bonus, for me, the little ball-chain loop that held the tag to the zipper works very nicely as a zipper-pull.  All the seams are solid, and it expanded from it&#x27;s squashed flat shipping form easily.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted -- a little more space than my old one.  Seams appear tight should anything leak.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the quality I expected.  This was a present.  Will use it for something else.</li>
            <li> Case was as described.  Was just what I was looking for.  Large enough to hold what I wanted and small enough to fit into my purse.  Clear vinyl makes it easy to find anything in the case.</li>
            <li> The zipper is weak, don&#x27;t pack full.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected. I was not able to fit enough in it to make it worth using.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to house all my little travel-size toiletries for the shower for a 2 week vacation. It&#x27;s small enough to be the perfect size just for those items (it&#x27;s just slightly taller than a toiletry bottle and wide enough to stack in 2), so I can grab it and run to the shower without digging through my larger case of makeup &amp; hair products. I love that it&#x27;s clear so you can see everything you have &amp; how much you have left. So far works as advertised but the plastic doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;d withstand years of travel. But at this price who cares?</li>
            <li> Love it, perfect size for cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, Thanks</li>
            <li> this is the best bag i&#x27;ve ever used in my purse.  it&#x27;s not too large, but it holds a LOT and best of all i can see everything !  no more losing hair clips or digging around for lip gloss--i even keep my reading cheaters in there.  love this clear little bag.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Turns out this bag is smaller than I thought it would be.  However I am keeping it...and using it just for make-up.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up but it is nice to have it.  I like the &#x27;clear&#x27; because I can see what is where.</li>
            <li> It quickly tore several  holes around the zipper.  The zipper is very hard to operate.  I would not recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> Just as I had hoped it would be.  Great for travel case.  When packed fully, sits nicely on counter. Many uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry my essential oils when I travel.</li>
            <li> This bag is OK. A little smaller than I thought it would be. Also, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, hard plastic. Serviceable for a few items.</li>
            <li> This bag is absolutely perfect for my makeup!</li>
            <li> I did not care for the quality of this product.  The picture provided looks like a higher quality than what I received.  I would not use this product for makeup as described.  This pouch would serve better for cords and cables.  Therefore, this product did not meet my needs or reasons for purchasing it.</li>
