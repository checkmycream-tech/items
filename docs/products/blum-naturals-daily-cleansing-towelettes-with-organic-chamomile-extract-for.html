            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the softness of these.</li>
            <li>It  smells more like a chemical additive, like parfume.</li>
            <li>and I love the chamomile scent.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.</li>
            <li>We love these wipes.</li>
            <li>STILL love these and continue purchasing them.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Smells great,  very soothing.</li>
            <li>Also I love that there aren&#x27;t chemicals and additives.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;d like it to leave my skin with a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a great size, has a nice light fragrance and really takes the make up off.</li>
            <li>Cool, refreshing, effective.</li>
            <li>These have a wonderful smell and are very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They smell absolutely fabulous and very mild, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Item has too strong of a perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>--they remove my makeup just fine, even my waterproof mascara and liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do a very good job and have a bitter taste if you happen to lick your lips after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving two stars, because while I do appreciate that the ingredients are better than most, the product as a whole just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great after a hard day&#x27;s work, cleans your skin well after baby spits up on you, nice to use as make up remover, feel fresh after gardening, take with you hiking for a quick face-clean, refreshing after a work out!  </li>
            <li>After finding out my other favorite make up wipes were tested on animals (Garnier, Olay, Neutrogena), I went on a quest to find a great wipe, that was eco-friendly.  </li>
            <li>They clean my face so nicely; leaving it feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely, leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
            <li>Blum wins again!</li>
            <li>Non-overpowering scent just leaves you feeling clean, not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>On the Pro side, all the Blum wipes I&#x27;ve used do clean well and are a convenient alternative to remove make up.</li>
            <li>These were nothing special.</li>
            <li>This product is very highly rated on EWG.org for safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitized to the ingredients and ends up turning bright red for 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I added them to my auto ship :)</li>
            <li>Really nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Quality wipes keep you clean and fresh without chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean and feeling calm.</li>
            <li>Cleans off wife&#x27;s makeup really quickly.</li>
            <li>Besides make-up removal, these work for a quick sponge bath to remove deodorant, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love how well these clean and leave my face feeling refreshed (and so soft!).</li>
            <li>The towel size is nice and big, they&#x27;re adequately moist, and they clean my skin and remove eye make up.</li>
            <li>Love these natural skin cleansing towelettes!</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite cleansing towelettes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and thicker than most wipes</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>They are not very moist  and don&#x27;t do a good job on eye makeup unless you use three or four.</li>
            <li>More importantly, though, I intended to use these for makeup removal, and they simply didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>These are so pure, clean &amp; calming.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I have a hard time believing such a strong fragrance is good for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li>Even with a lot of scrubbing and tugging at my face (which, of course, isn&#x27;t great for the skin), they took off very little makeup, and I had to use something else to finish getting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wash my face after using one because the odor was so overwhelming, but the smell was still apparent.</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take off eye make up at all though, thus I won&#x27;t be making a re purchase most likely, unless I can&#x27;t find another natrual brand.</li>
            <li>But, I love the gentleness of these facial wipes.</li>
            <li>Skin feels taught without being dry, a bit moist, and most of all -&gt; FRESH.  </li>
            <li>one of my faborite brands of wipes - they don&#x27;t really leave sticky residue and work very well for the whole body!</li>
            <li>I usually wash my face in the shower with mild facial cleansers, but these are great for those late night outs or for a quick refreshing cleansing.</li>
            <li>These really make you feel &amp;</li>
            <li>This product caused no irritation on my skin, and took off make-up very well.</li>
            <li>They are very &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the smell of these things is quite overpowering and floral, and I really didn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>I just keep on cleaning my face gently with a towelette and it all eventually comes off.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing and great for taking off makeup without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used and liked other Blum natural cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination , 40-something-year-old skin, and I read the ingredients on the back and was very pleased with the essential oils used.</li>
            <li>holy cow, so glad i chose these.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and easily takes off waterproof mascara and</li>
            <li>I found another pack at Marshall&#x27;s shortly after that and used both of those packs up quite quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial wipes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit like baby wipes though, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me as the scent is still fresh and clean and fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I looked at other reviews, and while I agree that the smell is a bit strong, I don&#x27;t mind the scent</li>
            <li>I like that these are natural, but they don&#x27;t remove eye makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive and aging skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>after using one my face felt clean and not overly-moist the way it used to with other kinds.  </li>
            <li>, most were too fragrant (I have sensitive eyes and hayfever), some were way too small for the prices and others</li>
            <li>It wipes of any dirt or makeup (not really mascara though) and leaves the skin feeling super soft and not dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t take the make off completely.  </li>
            <li>Be cautious if your skin is sensitive or if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>These are quite fragrant (even if it is natural).</li>
            <li>One towelettes cleans my face completely.</li>
            <li>but I can easily see past that.</li>
            <li>Clean behind your ears to enhance the fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Yes To.. is a VERY VERY close second, but these just have that extra luxury.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love them, but unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that usually turns red from most things I try, especially if I combine skincare items.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered these at Marshall&#x27;s and they clearly were marked down a bit</li>
            <li>I have Rosecea and have a hard time finding mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them for anyone with extremely dry and sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li>Trying not to clean my face with soap as it has over the years completely stripped my face dry, and with a combination of other things (like purified water mixed with a little apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin, but this has helped clear the little bit of acne she used to get.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of facial wipes only to find them too harsh, too heavily perfumed and with simply too many unacceptable ingredients.</li>
            <li>The thing to open and remove one and close it back keeps the little towels moist to the very end.</li>

            <li> , most were too fragrant (I have sensitive eyes and hayfever), some were way too small for the prices and others</li>
            <li> It wipes of any dirt or makeup (not really mascara though) and leaves the skin feeling super soft and not dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t take the make off completely.  </li>
            <li> Be cautious if your skin is sensitive or if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> These are quite fragrant (even if it is natural).</li>
            <li> One towelettes cleans my face completely.</li>
            <li> but I can easily see past that.</li>
            <li> Clean behind your ears to enhance the fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Yes To.. is a VERY VERY close second, but these just have that extra luxury.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love them, but unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that usually turns red from most things I try, especially if I combine skincare items.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered these at Marshall&#x27;s and they clearly were marked down a bit</li>
            <li> I have Rosecea and have a hard time finding mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I recommend them for anyone with extremely dry and sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Trying not to clean my face with soap as it has over the years completely stripped my face dry, and with a combination of other things (like purified water mixed with a little apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin, but this has helped clear the little bit of acne she used to get.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of facial wipes only to find them too harsh, too heavily perfumed and with simply too many unacceptable ingredients.</li>
            <li> The thing to open and remove one and close it back keeps the little towels moist to the very end.</li>
            <li> The wipes are rather dry and thin, and my face breaks out more often when I use them (and I have been trying for a few months).</li>
            <li> Thick, large towel.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
            <li> She has never had a problem with baby acne, milk rash, or dry skin.</li>
            <li> These do not further dry out my already dry skin, and they do remove makeup and dust (I live on a dusty mountain).  </li>
            <li> Due to my sensitive skin, there are not many products that work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of other organic wipes</li>
            <li> After I wipe her face down, I follow it up with California Baby Calendula Cream.</li>
            <li> they smell divine and are sooo soft--way less harsh than any other face wipes i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> They seem to spread eyeliner and mascara around instead of picking it up, giving me black eyes.</li>
            <li> Sort of earthy - not sweet perfumy.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re not full of garbage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little drying</li>
            <li> Combine with a little olive oil and voila!</li>
            <li> But if it is truly \\&quot;plant based\\&quot; they went waaaaay overboard.</li>
            <li> This smelled like a babies diaper small.</li>
            <li> I think I read a complaint on the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> But they just do a poor job of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> I use Ponds Cold Cream to remove my makeup at night and follow up with the Blum towelettes.</li>
            <li> but it is very difficult to remove mascara, even non-waterproof.</li>
            <li> This  one is loaded with sickening perfume.</li>

            <li> I really like these! They don&#x27;t sting, burn, or make my face itchy. They have a light smell and make my face tingle, In a good way. I recommend them for anyone with extremely dry and sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> After finding out my other favorite make up wipes were tested on animals (Garnier, Olay, Neutrogena), I went on a quest to find a great wipe, that was eco-friendly.  This is it.  I tried a ton of other organic wipes, most were too fragrant (I have sensitive eyes and hayfever), some were way too small for the prices and others just didn&#x27;t take the make off completely.  This is a great size, has a nice light fragrance and really takes the make up off. I&#x27;m ordering more today.  Very glad to have found this product!</li>
            <li> These really make you feel &amp;#34;freshened up&amp;#34;. I love the smell - I wish I could find organic perfume that smells like this.  Even better it is on subscribe and save! Thank you Blum Naturals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do a very good job and have a bitter taste if you happen to lick your lips after use. I think all natural products ought to not have a bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Great after a hard day&#x27;s work, cleans your skin well after baby spits up on you, nice to use as make up remover, feel fresh after gardening, take with you hiking for a quick face-clean, refreshing after a work out!  Quality wipes keep you clean and fresh without chemicals.  Non-overpowering scent just leaves you feeling clean, not perfumed.  Skin feels taught without being dry, a bit moist, and most of all -&gt; FRESH.  Clean behind your ears to enhance the fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I was buying this at the vitamin cottage until they stopped carrying it.  I am grateful that I could get it from Amazon.  It cleans my face without drying it out.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Cleans off wife&#x27;s makeup really quickly. Nice smell. She has very sensitive skin, but this has helped clear the little bit of acne she used to get.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very sensitive skin that usually turns red from most things I try, especially if I combine skincare items.  This product caused no irritation on my skin, and took off make-up very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent, very relaxing. Love the softness of these.</li>
            <li> Item has too strong of a perfume smell.  I did not like at all  I use it to remove makeup and it did do that..</li>
            <li> Trying not to clean my face with soap as it has over the years completely stripped my face dry, and with a combination of other things (like purified water mixed with a little apple cider vinegar) i found this stuff is awesome. It wipes of any dirt or makeup (not really mascara though) and leaves the skin feeling super soft and not dehydrated.  Smells a bit like baby wipes though, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me as the scent is still fresh and clean and fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the bottle version of this from Groupon and I found this on Amazon, so I had to order! I&#x27;m glad I did! This product removes a lot of makeup from my face and it smells so good! I will order again!</li>
            <li> I have used and liked other Blum natural cleansing wipes. This  one is loaded with sickening perfume. They don&#x27;t mention this in the ingredient list. I had to wash my face after using one because the odor was so overwhelming, but the smell was still apparent. I don&#x27;t think this is just a plant based scent, as they claim. It  smells more like a chemical additive, like parfume. But if it is truly \\&quot;plant based\\&quot; they went waaaaay overboard. On the Pro side, all the Blum wipes I&#x27;ve used do clean well and are a convenient alternative to remove make up.</li>
            <li> I love that this is organic and it feels nice on my face. The scent isn&#x27;t the best but I can easily see past that. It&#x27;s also a little drying so I have to moisturizer immediately after.</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite cleansing towelettes. Yes To.. is a VERY VERY close second, but these just have that extra luxury. They&#x27;re soft and thicker than most wipes and I love the chamomile scent. I first discovered these at Marshall&#x27;s and they clearly were marked down a bit so I bought them immediately. I fell in love. I found another pack at Marshall&#x27;s shortly after that and used both of those packs up quite quickly. I haven&#x27;t used them in about a year and decided I needed to get them again because the Yes To brand just wasn&#x27;t giving me what I get with these!</li>
            <li> I have been using these on my baby&#x27;s face since she was born. They are great for sensitive skin, have all-natural ingredients, and smell wonderful. After I wipe her face down, I follow it up with California Baby Calendula Cream. She has never had a problem with baby acne, milk rash, or dry skin. We love these wipes.</li>
            <li> Blum wins again! I have tried several different brands of facial wipes only to find them too harsh, too heavily perfumed and with simply too many unacceptable ingredients. I was leery of the smell of these with chamomile as I prefer unscented things, but the scent is very light and surprisingly pleasant. These do not further dry out my already dry skin, and they do remove makeup and dust (I live on a dusty mountain).  This is the one I am going to stick with! Great product. Lots of choices to satisfy everyone.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are awesome! I usually wash my face in the shower with mild facial cleansers, but these are great for those late night outs or for a quick refreshing cleansing. They smell absolutely fabulous and very mild, great for sensitive skin. I like them so much that I added them to my auto ship :)</li>
            <li> They are very soothing and great for taking off makeup without irritating my skin.  I have Rosecea and have a hard time finding mild cleanser.  Glad I found these!</li>
            <li> These smell delicious and aren&#x27;t greasy, but they aren&#x27;t effective in taking makeup off. They seem to spread eyeliner and mascara around instead of picking it up, giving me black eyes. I bought this for the EWG rating but will go back to the Neutrogena brand for the convenience.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin almost everything makes me breakout but THESE Do not! These are so pure, clean &amp; calming. These are perfect for acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> But they just do a poor job of cleaning my face.  The wipes are rather dry and thin, and my face breaks out more often when I use them (and I have been trying for a few months).</li>
            <li> This smelled like a babies diaper small. I did not like it all and had to throw it out because I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes because of the natural ingredients. This product is very highly rated on EWG.org for safe ingredients. And no fragrance. These do not burn when you use them to take off eye makeup. Combine with a little olive oil and voila!</li>
            <li> These are effective to remove dirt and makeup without all the unwanted chemicals. Nice smell and texture.</li>
            <li> These were nothing special.They are not very moist  and don&#x27;t do a good job on eye makeup unless you use three or four. They are very &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t care for since I have allergies.</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes because they had a good rating with EWG, and the Amazon reviews seemed pretty good.  I really wanted to love them, but unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell of these things is quite overpowering and floral, and I really didn&#x27;t care for it.  To be honest, I have a hard time believing such a strong fragrance is good for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin.  More importantly, though, I intended to use these for makeup removal, and they simply didn&#x27;t work.  Even with a lot of scrubbing and tugging at my face (which, of course, isn&#x27;t great for the skin), they took off very little makeup, and I had to use something else to finish getting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving two stars, because while I do appreciate that the ingredients are better than most, the product as a whole just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[EDIT: When I made my purchase, these were marketed as being for makeup removal, in addition to cleansing.  I noticed that they no longer seem to mention makeup removal, but I will leave this review up anyway, in case someone wonders about that aspect.]</li>
            <li> Best face wipes/makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried yet. These have a wonderful smell and are very gentle on my sensitive skin. My dermatologist in NYC even has these in his office! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and feeling calm. Not aggressive on my skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans the face. Doesn&#x27;t take off eye make up at all though, thus I won&#x27;t be making a re purchase most likely, unless I can&#x27;t find another natrual brand. Clearasil wipes are my fav, but they use chemicals I don&#x27;t want to put on my face</li>
            <li> this is a very nice wipe that does not irritate.  nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I use Ponds Cold Cream to remove my makeup at night and follow up with the Blum towelettes. They clean my face so nicely; leaving it feeling soft and healthy. No dryness or greasiness. Besides, they also have a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial wipes but my skin is sensitized to the ingredients and ends up turning bright red for 30-60 minutes. These do not do that to me at all! I have sensitive, combination , 40-something-year-old skin, and I read the ingredients on the back and was very pleased with the essential oils used. I&#x27;m happy, my skin is happy, and I have ordered these on a subscription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/3/15:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL love these and continue purchasing them. I looked at other reviews, and while I agree that the smell is a bit strong, I don&#x27;t mind the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger long. The scent comes from the essential oils, one of them being chamomile. I also disagree that these do not remove makeup--they remove my makeup just fine, even my waterproof mascara and liquid eyeliners. I just keep on cleaning my face gently with a towelette and it all eventually comes off. I love how well these clean and leave my face feeling refreshed (and so soft!). I purchased Blum&#x27;s oily/combination towelettes for my teen daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I like that these are natural, but they don&#x27;t remove eye makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I like this product for make-up removal, and the ingredients are good too. The thing to open and remove one and close it back keeps the little towels moist to the very end. Besides make-up removal, these work for a quick sponge bath to remove deodorant, etc.  Due to my sensitive skin, there are not many products that work for me.</li>
            <li> one of my faborite brands of wipes - they don&#x27;t really leave sticky residue and work very well for the whole body!</li>
            <li> Be cautious if your skin is sensitive or if you are sensitive to smells. These are quite fragrant (even if it is natural).</li>
            <li> holy cow, so glad i chose these. they smell divine and are sooo soft--way less harsh than any other face wipes i&#x27;ve ever tried. after using one my face felt clean and not overly-moist the way it used to with other kinds.  and these will definitely not irritate your skin/give it a burning feeling.  these are the best wipes i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I think I read a complaint on the smell of this product. I disagree. I think it smells really nice. Sort of earthy - not sweet perfumy. The towel size is nice and big, they&#x27;re adequately moist, and they clean my skin and remove eye make up. And they&#x27;re not full of garbage. I&#x27;ll keep my subscription to these.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Thick, large towel.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and easily takes off waterproof mascara and eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped looking for towelettes once I found these.  The fragrance is lovely, leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
            <li> Smells great,  very soothing. Gentle on my sensitive and aging skin. Also I love that there aren&#x27;t chemicals and additives.  I&#x27;d give it a 5 but it is very difficult to remove mascara, even non-waterproof. And I&#x27;d like it to leave my skin with a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li> Really nice on sensitive skin. .I do use coconut oil on eyes to remove makeup. But, I love the gentleness of these facial wipes.</li>
            <li> Love these natural skin cleansing towelettes! Cool, refreshing, effective. One towelettes cleans my face completely. Great re-sealable packaging.</li>
