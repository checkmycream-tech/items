            <li>good product; good price.</li>
            <li>being said, I have used this peel 4 times and have been delighted in the results.  </li>
            <li>Your face is the first thing people see and it should look its best!     </li>
            <li>I have been using this peel for a couple of months now and REALLY love it!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many times from them before and never had an issue until I received this shipment!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>, this product has given me a nice even skin complexion.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I wish they made a stronger peel for people like me.</li>
            <li>Great as a spot treatment for clients with breakouts that don&#x27;t want to do a full peel also.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it did burn and it was very strong.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin looking smooth and bright Use with care.</li>
            <li>and this wasn&#x27;t too strong, I intend on using it once a week until it is gone to see what kind of results I can achieve.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so amazed and pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The best part after doing this for a few months, is that people really noticed, and asked what I was doing to my skin (that it looked great!).</li>
            <li>What I distress most about are the acne and post-acne scars and pigmentation</li>
            <li>Over all, my skin looks much better.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more of this.</li>
            <li>:)     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to leave it on for longer</li>
            <li>but this is a goodthing because I&#x27;ve never been able to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that once I run out I&#x27;ll buy it again because it does help me more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I find that I get more stinging/effect if I continue to paint and repaint for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months and I am so impressed!   </li>
            <li>(I never thought I could ever have smooth skin!)</li>
            <li>I found this product on-line and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have done many BHA peels before</li>
            <li>My skin is still acne prone, this treatment once a week at most and</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before.</li>
            <li>after that I am able to put it on for 3-5 minutes at a time with an increment of 1 minute each time.  </li>
            <li>Right now my face feels good.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for introducing me to this amazing find!</li>
            <li>I was able to easily keep it on for 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it felt quite pleasant!</li>
            <li>and my skin seems to be more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and problem with acne and this has help to keep it clear and looking great.</li>
            <li>Even though my face didn&#x27;t look clearer (obviously blemishes can&#x27;t disappear that quickly lol), my skin looks more even.</li>
            <li>Very mild peel, I can leave it on for an hour and no burning.</li>
            <li>This works well, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is too strong for my daughter, who is 24.  </li>
            <li>It does burn a bit and the fumes are strong too.  </li>
            <li>then I would probably think I had pretty nice skin.  </li>
            <li>BUT THEN ONCE WASHED OFF ITS FINE.</li>
            <li>The Glycolic works for fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>You lost a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>I received the item very fast, so that&#x27;s a plus, the seller is very nice and fast, have no complaints there.</li>
            <li>Very good against acne breakout prevention and the diminishing of scars, but if you have dry skin, do not leave it on for longer than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>Within 30 minutes after using the product I saw immediate shrinkage in the size of my 3 huge pimples on my cheeks</li>
            <li>the huge whitehead I had on my cheek</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been needing to use a light moisturizer every day</li>
            <li>I hope that others have better success.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s still worth a try for most of you.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin felt smooth and I applied non-clogging moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin tone</li>
            <li>it make my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Hope others have the same amazing results as I have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the bumpiness on my forehead and my skin hasn&#x27;t been as oily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (one application every week) :)</li>
            <li>apply it once a week for 6 six weeks and then rest for 4 weeks and its actually during this rest time when I see the results, I&#x27;m not as oily/shiny as before, pores are smaller, break outs not as often and a more even skin tone, I&#x27;m actually very happy with what I see.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Even those super huge, r3ed swollen monsters that pop up that can take 2-3 weeks to heal are zapped overnight with this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the next best thing to going and getting a professional skin &#x27;peel&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>My acne has gotten much better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much more confident about my skin and life in general -</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see much as far as results</li>
            <li>I am able to keep in on for as much as 6/7 min.</li>
            <li>Reds either have gorgeous skin or the totally opposite.  </li>
            <li>I use a fan to help cool my skin.  </li>
            <li>All this improvements are progressive and accumulative, remember; you are not getting younger, you can&#x27;t expect to get to a point where you can say screw everything, I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m as good looking as I can be (or want)</li>
            <li>Smooth, fresh skin is what you get after its healed up.  </li>
            <li>and I KNOW what a true BHA peel is.</li>
            <li>If you cannot afford a dermatologist or do not have good medical insurance to visit one....</li>
            <li>it stings good deep into the epidermal</li>
            <li>follow with lots of cool water and your face will glow</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price compared to cheap ineffective drugstore products for those with cystic or severe acne.</li>
            <li>Having a cool fan blowing on your face helps with the stinging.  </li>
            <li>This led me to trying so many things - proactiv, benzoyl peroxide creams, natural remedies (tea tree oil, etc), even strong meds and creams from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>but I do suggest you start with something that&#x27;s not as strong as this on yet to get your skin use to this stuff because it burns like HELL at first until your skin get adjusted to it.</li>
            <li>within 24 hours my breakouts had shrunk tremendously.</li>
            <li>Wow is this stuff strong!</li>
            <li>If so, I&#x27;ll update on here again because it may be helpful to anyone who does live in a more humid environment.</li>
            <li>I started with the salicylic and was very conservative but very quickly switched to to BHA.  </li>
            <li>First off, what they sent is a liquid, not a gel as they advertise here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how the place you live can influence your skin! :)    </li>
            <li>careful with this product if you are using at home it is very strong and will cause peeling!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing what several months of this stuff can do!  </li>
            <li>but I can use everyday and it does wonderful things to help clear skin</li>
            <li>I like to get nice deep frosting on my face when I use peels.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS MORE LIKE A LIGHT FLAKING THAN ACTUAL PEELING.</li>
            <li>Very strong product - it will burn your skin if not used properly, so apply sparingly.</li>
            <li>Really is very strong and does peel off a layer of skin but has never left my face burned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been leaving the peel on for half an hour and then gently exfoliating my face with very warm water.</li>
            <li>My first step in the right direction was after I tried the Skin Laboratory Glycolac-60 peel.</li>
            <li>I started with lactic acid gels peels which are really good but didn&#x27;t seem to help with black heads.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it&#x27;s the same as the $135.00 facial I received at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>ITS VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li>Today was my first day using the Peel.  </li>
            <li>It did leave my skin soft and smooth after one use and did not make me peel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous and I completely recommend it if you have problem skin.  </li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I APPLIED IT TO MY NECK</li>
            <li>However, I am still willing to try it again to find out.   </li>
            <li>I definitely do not get as many pimples anymore</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and healthy looking that I feel comfortable going outside without make up on.</li>
            <li>In about 10 days, all the top layer of skin has come off and you are left with soft, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is just rubbing alcohol, does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...</li>
            <li>It just keeps getting better and better and my skin is far less oily.  </li>
            <li>I might give it more stars, but I&#x27;ve had only three, thirty minute sessions, and I don&#x27;t know how much improvement I have yet to see.</li>
            <li>Areas like my forehead and cheeks are very clear and smooth and soft to the touch after regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results of fewer razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions that come with the packaging carefully and do your research :)</li>
            <li>Applying the moisturizer really soothes the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>so I have not seen much change.</li>
            <li>Much stronger.</li>
            <li>I just felt like this might be important for anyone considering purchasing the product to know what the actual process is like rather than just the results.    </li>
            <li>I have had embarrassing skin my whole life and its hereditary.</li>
            <li>I applied this with a foundation brush which worked really well</li>
            <li>and when I do they heal much quicker.    </li>
            <li>Nothing ever worked and I was always really depressed with the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother</li>
            <li>This has worked very well for me before I have acne, scars &amp; oil skin.</li>
            <li>one needs to realize is that if they are very sun damaged (tanning bed use for years etc) or very wrinkled, it is going to help, but not eliminate.  </li>
            <li>Very disppointed.</li>
            <li>but i kept it on for 10 minutes straight anyway.</li>
            <li>mt skin is so much clearer</li>
            <li>So far it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Apply product carefully with a cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin looks much better.  </li>
            <li>This product has done more to cure my razor bumps than the $1500 dollars I spent in laser hair removal</li>
            <li>and it really has improved my face.</li>
            <li>Works like a vitalize peel...if you apply it 2-3 days straight.  </li>
            <li>And if you are looking for more answers, there is a YouTube video that I found just last night that explains some of their products, and offers some advice on which ones to start with.</li>
            <li>Other than very light peeling at my nose and chin creases</li>
            <li>I added 3 layers and even primed my face with acetone for better penetration and complete absence of oils, and still no frosting.</li>
            <li>I did get a little &#x27;frosting&#x27; but not like with a TCA peel which is good because I wanted something less strong.  </li>
            <li>The downsides to it all - mild to moderate peeling, red skin 1-2 days after application (even after applying moisturizer), strong fumes, and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in pore size/severe scars.</li>
            <li>I would have started with this peel treatment first and then went on to the glycolic peel as this peel breaks through the oil and would have made the glycolic peel work a little better.</li>
            <li>i like the other salicylic acid better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it for a longer duration in a few days and if I get a better result, I will give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it has really changed my life.</li>
            <li>I applied a light moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.     </li>
            <li>You start peeling after about two days, so the less makeup, the better.  </li>
            <li>I get regular white heads mostly around my cheeks side of face</li>
            <li>This peel is way to strong for home use though, I can&#x27;t believe it is sold to the general public.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this people to improve the texture &amp; appearance of acne scarred skin</li>
            <li>My pores are large and I had frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If I had researched chemical peels a little better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off with saying that I bought the 35 glycolic peel for my acne and was able to leave it on for 10 minutes (with little to no pain at all)</li>
            <li>and I can see immediate results - I highly recommend this product for those with very oily skin and also any accompanying lines and soft wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My forehead and nose tend to stay clear most of the time (although my nose does have little blackheads, but nothing that I distress much about).  </li>
            <li>I would have to wear layers of foundation just to look somewhat normal.  </li>
            <li>Overall, worth the negatives.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to try some more of their products once I finish this bottle, which by the way has lasted a very long time!</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old woman (with olive skin tone), with minimal signs of aging and some fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it takes some time to work properly, even though I really want fast results like everyone else.     </li>
            <li>this stuff does burn, especially the first time.</li>
            <li>This is not for people with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product religiously since I first bought it, applying it every 7-10 days.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly as if you had put hydrogen peroxide on a cut, (it made white foam).</li>
            <li>Hope I look 20 by next month ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing small blemishes and stops little break outs.  </li>
            <li>My chin even peeled a little which is fine with me</li>
            <li>I just applied it about half an hour ago for the first time and thought I would give anyone an idea of my first experience with it.    </li>
            <li>- I think this product is far better for us oily-skinned folks who really battle with clogged pores and excessive oil especially in the warmer months.    </li>
            <li>I am definitely still getting large pimples.    </li>
            <li>After the rinse I noticed some redness and little ice look over some areas of skin,  I woke up this morning and noticed that my huge pores that have been a problem area all over my face, have shrunk substantially.  </li>
            <li>my lines seem to be less deep and my skin looks very clean and renewed.  </li>
            <li>ANYONE TO AT LEAST TRY THIS PEEL OR THE OTHER SKIN LAB PEELS SINCE THEY ARE SUPER AFFORDABLE AND SAFE TO TRY AT HOME.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I can put up with under 5 minutes of torture if it will clear my skin.</li>
            <li>there hasn&#x27;t been a day that I&#x27;ve even been close to having clear skin.     </li>
            <li>and SO FAR</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on items such as this, but it really truly does what it says.</li>
            <li>I also have some adult acne scaring.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m trying to get rid of the old skin</li>
            <li>and wow, my skin has transformed.</li>
            <li>If it were not for the 8x magnification mirror my husband bought me when he saw me with an old makeup mirror from a thrift shop</li>
            <li>AND THEN A GENTLE CLEANSER AND FACE LOTION DAILY.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to leave it too long for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is stronger, in my opinion, than peels I got at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office in my early 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but this is by far stronger and gives me far quicker and definitive results.     </li>
            <li>But since using this product, it has helped with my skin complextion giving it an even shade of lighter brown that matches my natural arm and hand chest skin</li>
            <li>Seems to have helped my skin which is prone to oil build-up and adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am going to be 42 years old.  </li>
            <li>A few minutes is more than enough for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been noticing though that I think since I live in a dry area, it really contributes to my acne as well</li>
            <li>It is not a magic potion, but it definitely dries up acne breakouts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I could only stand 30 seconds; the 2nd I went 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I bought the products primarily for small blackheads and for acne scars, some age spots, and some wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is that I use to have very oily skin and was unable to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The second application of the Peel did not sting as much as the first time, but nevertheless still stung a little bit.  </li>
            <li>So I tried this one expecting major peeling and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.</li>
            <li>I patted my face dry and it was pretty red and still stinging</li>
            <li>But use common sense and follow the directions and read reviews until you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and have had stubborn acne since I was in middle school.  </li>
            <li>AND IT WAS TOO SENSITIVE AND RED</li>
            <li>It does for me, are the results worth the trouble?</li>
            <li>The label does not tell me what the % of the acids are and it smells very very toxic and burns my eyes and nose unlike any other individual peel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>the first time you put it on it feels a little freaky.  </li>
            <li>It did nothing for me with very tough oily acne large pore skin with lots and lots of peel experience and nothing on friend with very fair, delicate, small pores but sun damaged skin with nearly zero peel experience.</li>
            <li>The next day, actually by that night, all the new whiteheads which started under my skin prior to the peel were now out (above the skin) to start the healing process.</li>
            <li>As an experienced peel user, I was disappointed with the strength of this peel.</li>
            <li>Within the first few seconds of applying the peel on I felt the stinging/burning sensation that people have been talking about.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be worth the trouble!</li>
            <li>Anything would make my skin breakout and it seemed like I had new breakouts every single day!</li>
            <li>The next day, I found some of my dark spot acne scars (the relatively NEW old dark spot scars not the OLD OLD were a bit DARKER!</li>
            <li>I was breaking out less, my skin was smoother, and my complexion was really beginning to improve.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and stubborn black heads.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with the reduction of ingrown facial hair and it has lightened the dark blemishes of ingrown facial hair aftermath.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have a lighter brown skin complexion, but due to sensative skin, and razon bumps, my skin color is unbalanced, darker areas around my neck.  </li>
            <li>A little bottle filled with a clear liquid with a very heavy chemical smell, the only thing I can think of to compare it to would be nail polish remover</li>
            <li>I am almost 49 and still have very oily skin (little acne</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t seen much improvement overall, but I think it does help a little bit.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the OLD OLD dark spot acne scars were LIGHTER!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> , this product has given me a nice even skin complexion.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I wish they made a stronger peel for people like me.</li>
            <li> Great as a spot treatment for clients with breakouts that don&#x27;t want to do a full peel also.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it did burn and it was very strong.  </li>
            <li> It is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looking smooth and bright Use with care.</li>
            <li> and this wasn&#x27;t too strong, I intend on using it once a week until it is gone to see what kind of results I can achieve.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so amazed and pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The best part after doing this for a few months, is that people really noticed, and asked what I was doing to my skin (that it looked great!).</li>
            <li> What I distress most about are the acne and post-acne scars and pigmentation</li>
            <li> Over all, my skin looks much better.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more of this.</li>
            <li> :)     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to leave it on for longer</li>
            <li> but this is a goodthing because I&#x27;ve never been able to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that once I run out I&#x27;ll buy it again because it does help me more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I find that I get more stinging/effect if I continue to paint and repaint for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and I am so impressed!   </li>
            <li> (I never thought I could ever have smooth skin!)</li>
            <li> I found this product on-line and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have done many BHA peels before</li>
            <li> My skin is still acne prone, this treatment once a week at most and</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before.</li>
            <li> after that I am able to put it on for 3-5 minutes at a time with an increment of 1 minute each time.  </li>
            <li> Right now my face feels good.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for introducing me to this amazing find!</li>
            <li> I was able to easily keep it on for 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it felt quite pleasant!</li>
            <li> and my skin seems to be more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and problem with acne and this has help to keep it clear and looking great.</li>
            <li> Even though my face didn&#x27;t look clearer (obviously blemishes can&#x27;t disappear that quickly lol), my skin looks more even.</li>
            <li> Very mild peel, I can leave it on for an hour and no burning.</li>
            <li> This works well, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> This is too strong for my daughter, who is 24.  </li>
            <li> It does burn a bit and the fumes are strong too.  </li>
            <li> then I would probably think I had pretty nice skin.  </li>
            <li> BUT THEN ONCE WASHED OFF ITS FINE.</li>
            <li> The Glycolic works for fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> You lost a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I received the item very fast, so that&#x27;s a plus, the seller is very nice and fast, have no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Very good against acne breakout prevention and the diminishing of scars, but if you have dry skin, do not leave it on for longer than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Within 30 minutes after using the product I saw immediate shrinkage in the size of my 3 huge pimples on my cheeks</li>
            <li> the huge whitehead I had on my cheek</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been needing to use a light moisturizer every day</li>
            <li> I hope that others have better success.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s still worth a try for most of you.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin felt smooth and I applied non-clogging moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin tone</li>
            <li> it make my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Hope others have the same amazing results as I have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the bumpiness on my forehead and my skin hasn&#x27;t been as oily.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (one application every week) :)</li>
            <li> apply it once a week for 6 six weeks and then rest for 4 weeks and its actually during this rest time when I see the results, I&#x27;m not as oily/shiny as before, pores are smaller, break outs not as often and a more even skin tone, I&#x27;m actually very happy with what I see.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Even those super huge, r3ed swollen monsters that pop up that can take 2-3 weeks to heal are zapped overnight with this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the next best thing to going and getting a professional skin &#x27;peel&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> My acne has gotten much better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much more confident about my skin and life in general -</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see much as far as results</li>
            <li> I am able to keep in on for as much as 6/7 min.</li>
            <li> Reds either have gorgeous skin or the totally opposite.  </li>
            <li> I use a fan to help cool my skin.  </li>
            <li> All this improvements are progressive and accumulative, remember; you are not getting younger, you can&#x27;t expect to get to a point where you can say screw everything, I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m as good looking as I can be (or want)</li>
            <li> Smooth, fresh skin is what you get after its healed up.  </li>
            <li> and I KNOW what a true BHA peel is.</li>
            <li> If you cannot afford a dermatologist or do not have good medical insurance to visit one....</li>
            <li> it stings good deep into the epidermal</li>
            <li> follow with lots of cool water and your face will glow</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price compared to cheap ineffective drugstore products for those with cystic or severe acne.</li>
            <li> Having a cool fan blowing on your face helps with the stinging.  </li>
            <li> This led me to trying so many things - proactiv, benzoyl peroxide creams, natural remedies (tea tree oil, etc), even strong meds and creams from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> but I do suggest you start with something that&#x27;s not as strong as this on yet to get your skin use to this stuff because it burns like HELL at first until your skin get adjusted to it.</li>
            <li> within 24 hours my breakouts had shrunk tremendously.</li>
            <li> Wow is this stuff strong!</li>
            <li> If so, I&#x27;ll update on here again because it may be helpful to anyone who does live in a more humid environment.</li>
            <li> I started with the salicylic and was very conservative but very quickly switched to to BHA.  </li>
            <li> First off, what they sent is a liquid, not a gel as they advertise here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how the place you live can influence your skin! :)    </li>
            <li> careful with this product if you are using at home it is very strong and will cause peeling!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing what several months of this stuff can do!  </li>
            <li> but I can use everyday and it does wonderful things to help clear skin</li>
            <li> I like to get nice deep frosting on my face when I use peels.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS MORE LIKE A LIGHT FLAKING THAN ACTUAL PEELING.</li>
            <li> Very strong product - it will burn your skin if not used properly, so apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> Really is very strong and does peel off a layer of skin but has never left my face burned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been leaving the peel on for half an hour and then gently exfoliating my face with very warm water.</li>
            <li> My first step in the right direction was after I tried the Skin Laboratory Glycolac-60 peel.</li>
            <li> I started with lactic acid gels peels which are really good but didn&#x27;t seem to help with black heads.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, it&#x27;s the same as the $135.00 facial I received at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> ITS VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li> Today was my first day using the Peel.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my skin soft and smooth after one use and did not make me peel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous and I completely recommend it if you have problem skin.  </li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I APPLIED IT TO MY NECK</li>
            <li> However, I am still willing to try it again to find out.   </li>
            <li> I definitely do not get as many pimples anymore</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and healthy looking that I feel comfortable going outside without make up on.</li>
            <li> In about 10 days, all the top layer of skin has come off and you are left with soft, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is just rubbing alcohol, does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...</li>
            <li> It just keeps getting better and better and my skin is far less oily.  </li>
            <li> I might give it more stars, but I&#x27;ve had only three, thirty minute sessions, and I don&#x27;t know how much improvement I have yet to see.</li>
            <li> Areas like my forehead and cheeks are very clear and smooth and soft to the touch after regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results of fewer razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions that come with the packaging carefully and do your research :)</li>
            <li> Applying the moisturizer really soothes the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> so I have not seen much change.</li>
            <li> Much stronger.</li>
            <li> I just felt like this might be important for anyone considering purchasing the product to know what the actual process is like rather than just the results.    </li>
            <li> I have had embarrassing skin my whole life and its hereditary.</li>
            <li> I applied this with a foundation brush which worked really well</li>
            <li> and when I do they heal much quicker.    </li>
            <li> Nothing ever worked and I was always really depressed with the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me before I have acne, scars &amp; oil skin.</li>
            <li> one needs to realize is that if they are very sun damaged (tanning bed use for years etc) or very wrinkled, it is going to help, but not eliminate.  </li>
            <li> Very disppointed.</li>
            <li> but i kept it on for 10 minutes straight anyway.</li>
            <li> mt skin is so much clearer</li>
            <li> So far it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Apply product carefully with a cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin looks much better.  </li>
            <li> This product has done more to cure my razor bumps than the $1500 dollars I spent in laser hair removal</li>
            <li> and it really has improved my face.</li>
            <li> Works like a vitalize peel...if you apply it 2-3 days straight.  </li>
            <li> And if you are looking for more answers, there is a YouTube video that I found just last night that explains some of their products, and offers some advice on which ones to start with.</li>
            <li> Other than very light peeling at my nose and chin creases</li>
            <li> I added 3 layers and even primed my face with acetone for better penetration and complete absence of oils, and still no frosting.</li>
            <li> I did get a little &#x27;frosting&#x27; but not like with a TCA peel which is good because I wanted something less strong.  </li>
            <li> The downsides to it all - mild to moderate peeling, red skin 1-2 days after application (even after applying moisturizer), strong fumes, and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in pore size/severe scars.</li>
            <li> I would have started with this peel treatment first and then went on to the glycolic peel as this peel breaks through the oil and would have made the glycolic peel work a little better.</li>
            <li> i like the other salicylic acid better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it for a longer duration in a few days and if I get a better result, I will give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it has really changed my life.</li>
            <li> I applied a light moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.     </li>
            <li> You start peeling after about two days, so the less makeup, the better.  </li>
            <li> I get regular white heads mostly around my cheeks side of face</li>
            <li> This peel is way to strong for home use though, I can&#x27;t believe it is sold to the general public.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this people to improve the texture &amp; appearance of acne scarred skin</li>
            <li> My pores are large and I had frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If I had researched chemical peels a little better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with saying that I bought the 35 glycolic peel for my acne and was able to leave it on for 10 minutes (with little to no pain at all)</li>
            <li> and I can see immediate results - I highly recommend this product for those with very oily skin and also any accompanying lines and soft wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My forehead and nose tend to stay clear most of the time (although my nose does have little blackheads, but nothing that I distress much about).  </li>
            <li> I would have to wear layers of foundation just to look somewhat normal.  </li>
            <li> Overall, worth the negatives.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to try some more of their products once I finish this bottle, which by the way has lasted a very long time!</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman (with olive skin tone), with minimal signs of aging and some fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that it takes some time to work properly, even though I really want fast results like everyone else.     </li>
            <li> this stuff does burn, especially the first time.</li>
            <li> This is not for people with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously since I first bought it, applying it every 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly as if you had put hydrogen peroxide on a cut, (it made white foam).</li>
            <li> Hope I look 20 by next month ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for removing small blemishes and stops little break outs.  </li>
            <li> My chin even peeled a little which is fine with me</li>
            <li> I just applied it about half an hour ago for the first time and thought I would give anyone an idea of my first experience with it.    </li>
            <li> - I think this product is far better for us oily-skinned folks who really battle with clogged pores and excessive oil especially in the warmer months.    </li>
            <li> I am definitely still getting large pimples.    </li>
            <li> After the rinse I noticed some redness and little ice look over some areas of skin,  I woke up this morning and noticed that my huge pores that have been a problem area all over my face, have shrunk substantially.  </li>
            <li> my lines seem to be less deep and my skin looks very clean and renewed.  </li>
            <li> ANYONE TO AT LEAST TRY THIS PEEL OR THE OTHER SKIN LAB PEELS SINCE THEY ARE SUPER AFFORDABLE AND SAFE TO TRY AT HOME.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I can put up with under 5 minutes of torture if it will clear my skin.</li>
            <li> there hasn&#x27;t been a day that I&#x27;ve even been close to having clear skin.     </li>
            <li> and SO FAR</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on items such as this, but it really truly does what it says.</li>
            <li> I also have some adult acne scaring.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m trying to get rid of the old skin</li>
            <li> and wow, my skin has transformed.</li>
            <li> If it were not for the 8x magnification mirror my husband bought me when he saw me with an old makeup mirror from a thrift shop</li>
            <li> AND THEN A GENTLE CLEANSER AND FACE LOTION DAILY.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to leave it too long for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is stronger, in my opinion, than peels I got at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office in my early 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but this is by far stronger and gives me far quicker and definitive results.     </li>
            <li> But since using this product, it has helped with my skin complextion giving it an even shade of lighter brown that matches my natural arm and hand chest skin</li>
            <li> Seems to have helped my skin which is prone to oil build-up and adult acne.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 42 years old.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes is more than enough for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing though that I think since I live in a dry area, it really contributes to my acne as well</li>
            <li> It is not a magic potion, but it definitely dries up acne breakouts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I could only stand 30 seconds; the 2nd I went 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought the products primarily for small blackheads and for acne scars, some age spots, and some wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is that I use to have very oily skin and was unable to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The second application of the Peel did not sting as much as the first time, but nevertheless still stung a little bit.  </li>
            <li> So I tried this one expecting major peeling and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.</li>
            <li> I patted my face dry and it was pretty red and still stinging</li>
            <li> But use common sense and follow the directions and read reviews until you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have had stubborn acne since I was in middle school.  </li>
            <li> AND IT WAS TOO SENSITIVE AND RED</li>
            <li> It does for me, are the results worth the trouble?</li>
            <li> The label does not tell me what the % of the acids are and it smells very very toxic and burns my eyes and nose unlike any other individual peel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the first time you put it on it feels a little freaky.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for me with very tough oily acne large pore skin with lots and lots of peel experience and nothing on friend with very fair, delicate, small pores but sun damaged skin with nearly zero peel experience.</li>
            <li> The next day, actually by that night, all the new whiteheads which started under my skin prior to the peel were now out (above the skin) to start the healing process.</li>
            <li> As an experienced peel user, I was disappointed with the strength of this peel.</li>
            <li> Within the first few seconds of applying the peel on I felt the stinging/burning sensation that people have been talking about.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> Anything would make my skin breakout and it seemed like I had new breakouts every single day!</li>
            <li> The next day, I found some of my dark spot acne scars (the relatively NEW old dark spot scars not the OLD OLD were a bit DARKER!</li>
            <li> I was breaking out less, my skin was smoother, and my complexion was really beginning to improve.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and stubborn black heads.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with the reduction of ingrown facial hair and it has lightened the dark blemishes of ingrown facial hair aftermath.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have a lighter brown skin complexion, but due to sensative skin, and razon bumps, my skin color is unbalanced, darker areas around my neck.  </li>
            <li> A little bottle filled with a clear liquid with a very heavy chemical smell, the only thing I can think of to compare it to would be nail polish remover</li>
            <li> I am almost 49 and still have very oily skin (little acne</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen much improvement overall, but I think it does help a little bit.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the OLD OLD dark spot acne scars were LIGHTER!</li>
            <li> I have to clarify that the spots which were getting darker was actually healing process, two days afterwards the upper skin of the dark spot flaked off and underneath new skin that was lighter.</li>
            <li> I also have a smaller pimple on my other cheek and that seemed to have almost shrunk completely.    </li>
            <li> Maybe other people don&#x27;t have such a sensitive reaction to the BHA+</li>
            <li> my skin felt normal with a little bit of redness around my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I live in a really dry area too and since it&#x27;s winter, it&#x27;s especially dry.     </li>
            <li> I quickly learned that I need to avoid the scabby red areas or they just get worse.  </li>
            <li> The average person at home might over use and cause scarring or damage that will take a lot of professional help to repair.  </li>
            <li> and I have a lot of old dark acne spots.</li>
            <li> Even during washing the peel off with cold water I still felt the stinging, but after immediately applying a moisturizer (I&#x27;m using Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with SPF 30)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m french, haitian and dominican (white, black, spanish), i don&#x27;t know if skin tone is a facto to these results?</li>
            <li> Be prepared to have peeling for a solid week, but the plus is there is only a couple hour window of redness unlike other chemical peels.</li>
            <li> just got the peel and only used it once bt be careful bcz</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my clients that want a little extra power in their peels.  </li>
            <li> next to using my other TCA peel this one is milder</li>
            <li> Due to financial reasons, I had to stop.  </li>
            <li> I will be following the directions carefully!</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because I have facials done but never saw any real results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that there are positive effects that are overshadowed by the 15 angry red spots on my face</li>
            <li> I am an african american male, that suffers from very sensative skin that becomes irritated from daily shaving, I suffer from ingrown facial hair that causes razor bumps, a day after shaving, dark blemishes and bumps appear around my neck and underneath my chin where I shave.  </li>
            <li> and since I have ethnic medium pigmentd skin it left dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li> They are less numerous</li>
            <li> Left for about 1 and a half minutes, it did not burn me</li>
            <li> I immediately break out after I use this and then have a little peeling the next day or two.  </li>
            <li> I left it on a little longer on my chest and hands.(which</li>
            <li> This is a serious product - not for the new to peels user or someone who expects a day at the spa feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and the key for me was leaving it on longer.</li>
            <li> I read on a dermatological treatment center&#x27;s website that their chemical peel treatments were done in 30 minute sessions, once a week.</li>
            <li> I think that for anyone with difficult skin, this product is without a doubt worth trying.</li>
            <li> so it stays wet.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS MINIMAL</li>
            <li> If all areas stay covered with Aquaphor or antibiotic ointment, your peeling is minimal.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the Glyco/Lac level two and not much happened.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I am 49, very fair-skinned, am experiencing the worst acne of my life (though still not terrible if I would leave it alone).  </li>
            <li> It helps to dry my skin, peeling is minimal and any outbreaks are dried up within 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> I will update again in a few weeks to let you all know how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> AND DITCHING ALL MY OTHER FACE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> though I see that&#x27;s a problem for some in other reviews.    </li>
            <li> It is watery compared to other products.</li>
            <li> This peel works well for active breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have worked up to three and have gotten a little sun burnt looking, but not much else.</li>
            <li> The stinging on my forehead is quite intense, but I have not suffered any ill effects because of it.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the worst skin in the world - severe acne, scars, super oily skin, large pores, you name it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been getting less acne flareups and my dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> But trust me, if you have skin as bad as I did, it&#x27;s so worth it!  </li>
            <li> (I went from well over a hundred zits to 1-3!), and my skin is a lot less oily.</li>
            <li> I have excessive oil production on my face due to genetics and due to medication.  </li>
            <li> I have previously ordered this product.</li>
            <li> However the results are much less drying and not as drastic as glycolic or lactic acid peels.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Glycolic and Lactic acids previously</li>
            <li> Withing one bha peel, I noticed less black heads and tighter pores.  </li>
            <li> Sneaking in some plain rubbing alcohol in your shipments hoping that some customers won&#x27;t realize that this is not a real peel!</li>
            <li> Chin and forehead are a mess.</li>
            <li> this peel is done, your face feels sunburned and tight.  </li>
            <li> (I just poured a little in a glass bowl) and then nuetralized it with a mixture of water and baking soda on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> So, forget I even mentioned anything about dark acne spots!</li>
            <li> I had used it for 4 months, until deciding that I needed something a little stronger</li>
            <li> But with a little sun damage(temples, forehead) and being 49, I decided to buy this peel.  </li>
            <li> But you have to realize that you need to be prepared beforehand with baking soda water mixture(1 or 2 tbsp in a little bowl of water) and a hair dryer to minimize the burning sensation on your skin.  </li>
            <li> She uses the 25% tca chemical peel for a little scarring and cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> This is a level four peel, so I was a little apprehensive.</li>
            <li> I get 2-4 really big sore pimples at a time (under the skin or showing through) which I turn into big ugly red scars that come from poking, stabbing with pins, using oxy products, and picking the scab too early.  </li>
            <li> has completely dried out and shrunk in size.  </li>
            <li> I WAS SCARED ABOUT HOW HARSH IT WOULD BE ON MY SKIN BUT</li>
            <li> MY FACE DOES PEEL AFTER A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> As with the product used at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, this will burn for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m confused about what the 1-4 system means, if it doesn&#x27;t actually indicate the depth of the peel.</li>
            <li> and that was a bit unnerving, but after about a dozen splashes I dried my face and the stinging subsided.  </li>
            <li> Half of your money winds up in the trash as the applicator absorbs all of the product and you get only a very thin coating on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I peeled very little to none.</li>
            <li> My whole family has bad skin.  </li>
            <li> I even just recently referred them to a friend who was looking for a cheaper alternative to the expensive doctors&#x27; treatments.</li>
            <li> I use a small eyeshadow brush and paint it on.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what they are doing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think my BHA+ solution was expired because I have used this product in the past and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Glycolic Peels at the 50% grade for the past year.  </li>
            <li> This peel can be very harsh for sensative clients.  </li>
            <li> This is a peel to use if you have already used a peel at home before, have older skin or  bad acne or scarring.  </li>
            <li> that, your road towards the skin you want and deserve will be a lot less frustrating and stress</li>
            <li> I left the peel on for about 1.5 minutes and washed it off with lots and lots of cold water.  </li>
            <li> I than rinsed the peel with cold water mixed with Baking Soda.  </li>
            <li> I started using this after my chemo treatment when my skin was dull, gray, and broken out.  </li>
            <li> This one is just too weak for me.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME STUNG THE WORST</li>
            <li> Follow directions  or you can get irritating results.  </li>
            <li> In my case; yes, the results are subtle but noticeable, will this be the cure to all my ill?</li>
            <li> Call me weird</li>
            <li> Think sunburn with using it for a minute, not the awful red, oozy stuff you have seen online with chemical peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin on and off since I was 13 (whiteheads, blackheads, cystic acne, dark spots, you name it</li>
            <li> this product stung like crazy</li>
            <li> It stings and after one minute I rinsed with cold H2O as directed.  </li>
            <li> (I have accidentally burned between my fingers, but nothing bad).</li>
            <li> now and it never has been painful for me</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions that come with the product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its annoying and</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this company!</li>
            <li> Worst break out in my life.</li>
            <li> I must have the worst skin ever, because it didn&#x27;t burn me at ALL when I put this on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this product regularly.  It is not a magic potion, but it definitely dries up acne breakouts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1.5 months now and SO FAR SO GOOD! I&#x27;ve had horrible skin on and off since I was 13 (whiteheads, blackheads, cystic acne, dark spots, you name it, I had it) and this is the best my skin has looked in a while. i use this solution once a week. I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been getting less acne flareups and my dark spots are fading. No it&#x27;s not a miracle product but with time and patience you definitely see results.    BTW this stuff does burn, especially the first time. Call me weird but it makes me feel like it&#x27;s working, I like it. Follow the directions that come with the packaging carefully and do your research :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and the key for me was leaving it on longer. I read on a dermatological treatment center&#x27;s website that their chemical peel treatments were done in 30 minute sessions, once a week. I&#x27;ve been leaving the peel on for half an hour and then gently exfoliating my face with very warm water. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the bumpiness on my forehead and my skin hasn&#x27;t been as oily. I might give it more stars, but I&#x27;ve had only three, thirty minute sessions, and I don&#x27;t know how much improvement I have yet to see.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed and pleased with this purchase. I did a lot of research on items such as this, but it really truly does what it says. I am a 30 year old woman (with olive skin tone), with minimal signs of aging and some fine lines on my forehead. I also have some adult acne scaring. This not only made my skin feel brighter but it also helped with those stubborn acne scars. WARNING it does sting, so it takes some time to build your tolerance to the product. I would do it only once a week, at night before I go to bed, and followed with Cetaphil basic face lotion (which helped a lot). The best part after doing this for a few months, is that people really noticed, and asked what I was doing to my skin (that it looked great!). That made me even happier that others had noticed the improvement in my skin tone. Your face is the first thing people see and it should look its best!     I am definitely going to try some more of their products once I finish this bottle, which by the way has lasted a very long time! Still amazed and impressed with this company. I even just recently referred them to a friend who was looking for a cheaper alternative to the expensive doctors&#x27; treatments. I don&#x27;t mind that it takes some time to work properly, even though I really want fast results like everyone else.     And if you are looking for more answers, there is a YouTube video that I found just last night that explains some of their products, and offers some advice on which ones to start with. If you follow the directions that come with the product, you will not be disappointed. Thanks Amazon for introducing me to this amazing find!</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my clients that want a little extra power in their peels.  This peel can be very harsh for sensative clients.  Great as a spot treatment for clients with breakouts that don&#x27;t want to do a full peel also.  This peel is way to strong for home use though, I can&#x27;t believe it is sold to the general public.  Estheticians learn in school how to deal with using peels per skin type and how to deal with issues that might arise.  The average person at home might over use and cause scarring or damage that will take a lot of professional help to repair.  No one but professionals should be applying a salicylic peel of this strength.</li>
            <li> next to using my other TCA peel this one is milder but I can use everyday and it does wonderful things to help clear skin</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have had stubborn acne since I was in middle school.  I tend to have oil-prone skin around my forehead, nose and cheeks.  My forehead and nose tend to stay clear most of the time (although my nose does have little blackheads, but nothing that I distress much about).  What I distress most about are the acne and post-acne scars and pigmentation (what I have are red to brown spots) on my cheeks and temples.  I have tried using Pro-Active, Vitamin E creams, Aloe Vera, Tea Tree oil, home remedies such as: oatmeal+cinnamon+honey, lemon juice...but nothing seemed to make my acne or scars disappear.    Today was my first day using the Peel.  Within the first few seconds of applying the peel on I felt the stinging/burning sensation that people have been talking about.  I left the peel on for about 1.5 minutes and washed it off with lots and lots of cold water.  Even during washing the peel off with cold water I still felt the stinging, but after immediately applying a moisturizer (I&#x27;m using Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with SPF 30) my skin felt normal with a little bit of redness around my cheeks.  Within 30 minutes after using the product I saw immediate shrinkage in the size of my 3 huge pimples on my cheeks and my skin seems to be more smooth.  I also have a smaller pimple on my other cheek and that seemed to have almost shrunk completely.    I will post an update after my second trial.    2nd Update:  The second application of the Peel did not sting as much as the first time, but nevertheless still stung a little bit.  It has been about 15 minutes after washing off the Peel and the huge whitehead I had on my cheek has completely dried out and shrunk in size.  My face isn&#x27;t nearly as red after washing off the product the second time around.  Applying the moisturizer really soothes the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> good product; good price.</li>
            <li> Using this to stop acne and oil.  I did 8 treatments with 50% glycolic peel and now am using this product next.  Doing ten peels over a course of 10 weeks.  I immediately break out after I use this and then have a little peeling the next day or two.  Over all, my skin looks much better.  I have a lot of sun, smoking, and acne damage to my skin.  I have used this for about 3 weeks and I do notice a difference in my skin.  If I had researched chemical peels a little better I would have started with this peel treatment first and then went on to the glycolic peel as this peel breaks through the oil and would have made the glycolic peel work a little better.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so I have not seen much change. It did leave my skin soft and smooth after one use and did not make me peel.</li>
            <li> It works!! Skin looks and feels great a day after I peel.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is where has this been all my life? I plan to buy more of this. Does this come in a bigger bottle?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done 2 peels.  The first time I could only stand 30 seconds; the 2nd I went 2 minutes.  This is not for people with sensitive skin!  I see a difference already and happy I made this purchase.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice (once every 5 - 10 days) but I have definitely noticed a tightening of my pores and softness to my skin.  My chin even peeled a little which is fine with me, I&#x27;m trying to get rid of the old skin wooohooo!</li>
            <li> I received the item very fast, so that&#x27;s a plus, the seller is very nice and fast, have no complaints there. As an experienced peel user, I was disappointed with the strength of this peel. I added 3 layers and even primed my face with acetone for better penetration and complete absence of oils, and still no frosting. I peeled very little to none. I like to get nice deep frosting on my face when I use peels. This one is just too weak for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with saying that I bought the 35 glycolic peel for my acne and was able to leave it on for 10 minutes (with little to no pain at all) and I applied it every three days. I honestly didn&#x27;t see much as far as results so I ordered the BHA+.     I just applied it about half an hour ago for the first time and thought I would give anyone an idea of my first experience with it.    WOW! Much stronger. It felt like it was burning my face off. From the time I started applying to my forehead until the time I started rinsing it off was probably an even 60 seconds. Very painful. It took a lot of rinsing until the burning was just a stinging. I patted my face dry and it was pretty red and still stinging but that all went away within 2 minutes. Even though my face didn&#x27;t look clearer (obviously blemishes can&#x27;t disappear that quickly lol), my skin looks more even. Right now my face feels good. I applied a light moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.     Maybe other people don&#x27;t have such a sensitive reaction to the BHA+ like I did but I feel like I can put up with under 5 minutes of torture if it will clear my skin. Hopefully it will be worth the trouble! :)     I will update again in a few weeks to let you all know how it works in the long run. I just felt like this might be important for anyone considering purchasing the product to know what the actual process is like rather than just the results.    UPDATE!    I have been using this product religiously since I first bought it, applying it every 7-10 days. I still haven&#x27;t seen much improvement overall, but I think it does help a little bit. It almost seems like the pimples themselves are smaller. They are less numerous but I still definitely have acne and there hasn&#x27;t been a day that I&#x27;ve even been close to having clear skin.     I&#x27;ve been able to leave it on for longer and I always leave it on for 5-6 minutes. It does dry out my skin and I&#x27;ve been needing to use a light moisturizer every day but this is a goodthing because I&#x27;ve never been able to use moisturizer. I live in a really dry area too and since it&#x27;s winter, it&#x27;s especially dry.     I do think that overall my skin has improved, but this product hasn&#x27;t been a miracle worker for me. I&#x27;ve been noticing though that I think since I live in a dry area, it really contributes to my acne as well because whenever I go on vacation to a humid place, my face clears up immensely. I&#x27;m moving to Hawaii in about 6 months so maybe with this product combined with some humidity to keep my face moisturized, I will improve. If so, I&#x27;ll update on here again because it may be helpful to anyone who does live in a more humid environment. It&#x27;s funny how the place you live can influence your skin! :)    I think that for anyone with difficult skin, this product is without a doubt worth trying. I&#x27;m sure that once I run out I&#x27;ll buy it again because it does help me more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> 2nd bottle. Keeps my skin looking smooth and bright Use with care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another peel of lesser strength and today this came. I tried it and wow, my skin has transformed. My pores are so much smaller, not oily and the tone is evening out. I just love this stuff.  I hope it continues to work the same for my problem skin. I&#x27;m 50 with a history of acne from the age of 14. I have had embarrassing skin my whole life and its hereditary. My whole family has bad skin.  But this has changed things. My mom saw me and she immediately asked what I was doing to my skin. It&#x27;s fabulous and I completely recommend it if you have problem skin.  Yes, it did burn and it was very strong.  Be careful if you have sensitive skin.  My skin is the type that nothing has ever worked, even the so called strongest of acne products. Even prescription acne meds have done nothing for me but this worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the salicylic acid and the BHA.  I am 49, very fair-skinned, am experiencing the worst acne of my life (though still not terrible if I would leave it alone).  I bought the products primarily for small blackheads and for acne scars, some age spots, and some wrinkles.  If it were not for the 8x magnification mirror my husband bought me when he saw me with an old makeup mirror from a thrift shop then I would probably think I had pretty nice skin.  I get 2-4 really big sore pimples at a time (under the skin or showing through) which I turn into big ugly red scars that come from poking, stabbing with pins, using oxy products, and picking the scab too early.  I started with the salicylic and was very conservative but very quickly switched to to BHA.  I used it for 2-1/2 minutes, 2 days later for 5 minutes, the next day for 5 minutes, 2 days later for 7 minutes.  Other than very light peeling at my nose and chin creases I have seen no results.  I quickly learned that I need to avoid the scabby red areas or they just get worse.  I hope that others have better success.  It&#x27;s possible that there are positive effects that are overshadowed by the 15 angry red spots on my face but I can&#x27;t tell.  I am definitely still getting large pimples.    I think it&#x27;s still worth a try for most of you.  I would skip the gauze or cotton balls.  Half of your money winds up in the trash as the applicator absorbs all of the product and you get only a very thin coating on your skin.  I use a small eyeshadow brush and paint it on.  I find that I get more stinging/effect if I continue to paint and repaint for a couple of minutes so it stays wet.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ON A WHIM TO GET RID OF SOME DISCOLORATION SCARS LEFT FROM ACNE. I HAVE COMBINATION OILY SKIN AND GET CYSTIC ACNE SPOTS ONCE A MONTH. I HAVE USED THIS THREE TIMES AND IT HAS NOT ONLY FADED MY SCARS BUT HAS ALSO HELPED MY SKIN TEXTURE OVERALL AND I HAVENT HAD A BREAKOUT YET. I HAVE STOPPED USING MY PRESCRIPTION ACNE GEL. I HAVE USED THIS PEEL ONCE EVERY 10 DAYS AND THEN A GENTLE CLEANSER AND FACE LOTION DAILY. I THINK I CAN GET ABOUT 6-8 PEELS OUT OF THIS BOTTLE. I WAS SCARED ABOUT HOW HARSH IT WOULD BE ON MY SKIN BUT ITS VERY GENTLE. I LEAVE IT ON FOR 4 MINUTES AND IT STINGS A BIT BUT THEN ONCE WASHED OFF ITS FINE. THE FIRST TIME STUNG THE WORST BUT NOW MY SKIN IS USED TO IT. MY FACE DOES PEEL AFTER A FEW DAYS BUT IT IS MINIMAL AND IT IS MORE LIKE A LIGHT FLAKING THAN ACTUAL PEELING. THE FIRST TIME I APPLIED IT TO MY NECK AND IT WAS TOO SENSITIVE AND RED AFTER SO I DONT RECOMMEND THAT. I DIDNT GET THIS INITIALLY AS AN ACNE TREATMENT BUT IM SUPRISED HOW WELL IT HAS WORKED ON MY SKIN AND I PLAN ON USING IT EVERY 2 - 4 WEEKS FROM NOW ON AND DITCHING ALL MY OTHER FACE PRODUCTS. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND ANYONE TO AT LEAST TRY THIS PEEL OR THE OTHER SKIN LAB PEELS SINCE THEY ARE SUPER AFFORDABLE AND SAFE TO TRY AT HOME.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and since I have ethnic medium pigmentd skin it left dark patches on my face. I will not use this product again!!!</li>
            <li> This works well, not too strong.  I was able to easily keep it on for 4 minutes.  I did get a little &#x27;frosting&#x27; but not like with a TCA peel which is good because I wanted something less strong.  I applied this with a foundation brush which worked really well (I just poured a little in a glass bowl) and then nuetralized it with a mixture of water and baking soda on a cotton ball (used about 5-6).  I use Retin A nightly and this wasn&#x27;t too strong, I intend on using it once a week until it is gone to see what kind of results I can achieve.</li>
            <li> So, I received it promptly. I tried it for the first time last night. I should mention that I have medium acne. I get regular white heads mostly around my cheeks side of face and I have a lot of old dark acne spots. Left for about 1 and a half minutes, it did not burn me but I didn&#x27;t want to leave it too long for the first time. I washed with copious amounts of water afterwards. However, I found the places where I already had a breakout (whiteheads), the peel seemed to stay on there and wouldn&#x27;t come off after washing with water. It looked exactly as if you had put hydrogen peroxide on a cut, (it made white foam). Afterwards, my skin felt smooth and I applied non-clogging moisturizer. The next day, I found some of my dark spot acne scars (the relatively NEW old dark spot scars not the OLD OLD were a bit DARKER! HOWEVER, the OLD OLD dark spot acne scars were LIGHTER! I don&#x27;t know if its healing or what is going on with that! However, I am still willing to try it again to find out.   I have light olive skin tone, I&#x27;m french, haitian and dominican (white, black, spanish), i don&#x27;t know if skin tone is a facto to these results? The next day, actually by that night, all the new whiteheads which started under my skin prior to the peel were now out (above the skin) to start the healing process. So the peel helped in that regard. I am going to try it again in 7 to 10 days and will update this review.    !!!!UPDATE!!!    So, I have used this product for a total of three times now and I am already seeing results. I have to clarify that the spots which were getting darker was actually healing process, two days afterwards the upper skin of the dark spot flaked off and underneath new skin that was lighter. So, forget I even mentioned anything about dark acne spots! (lol).    My favorite thing about this product is that I use to have very oily skin and was unable to use moisturizer. Since using this product, my skin is not oily anymore! I am able to wear moisturizer, which is wonderful. I am able to keep in on for as much as 6/7 min. now and it never has been painful for me in anyway though I see that&#x27;s a problem for some in other reviews.    I definitely do not get as many pimples anymore and when I do they heal much quicker.    BOTTOMLINE: Great product, make it part of your skin care regime.</li>
            <li> This peel works well for active breakouts.  You can see it working immediately and within 24 hours my breakouts had shrunk tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and I am so impressed!   I used to have the worst skin in the world - severe acne, scars, super oily skin, large pores, you name it. Anything would make my skin breakout and it seemed like I had new breakouts every single day! This led me to trying so many things - proactiv, benzoyl peroxide creams, natural remedies (tea tree oil, etc), even strong meds and creams from a dermatologist. Nothing ever worked and I was always really depressed with the condition of my skin. I would have to wear layers of foundation just to look somewhat normal.  My first step in the right direction was after I tried the Skin Laboratory Glycolac-60 peel. It changed my skin! I was breaking out less, my skin was smoother, and my complexion was really beginning to improve. I had used it for 4 months, until deciding that I needed something a little stronger (I was still breaking out and using lots of acne creams simultaneously).   I came across the BHA+ peel, so I figured I would give it a try. Wow is this stuff strong! It stung more after application, had stronger fumes, but delivered great results after a month of use! My skin is so much smoother (I never thought I could ever have smooth skin!), all of my breakouts are almost gone (I went from well over a hundred zits to 1-3!), and my skin is a lot less oily. And I&#x27;ve only used this for about 3 1/2 months and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (one application every week) :) What a $$$ saver!  One of the biggest benefits? I&#x27;ve never had to use acne creams or had a breakout since I&#x27;ve started! My skin is so clear and healthy looking that I feel comfortable going outside without make up on. I feel so much more confident about my skin and life in general - it&#x27;s amazing what several months of this stuff can do!  The downsides to it all - mild to moderate peeling, red skin 1-2 days after application (even after applying moisturizer), strong fumes, and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in pore size/severe scars. But trust me, if you have skin as bad as I did, it&#x27;s so worth it!  I highly recommend this product, it has really changed my life. And note - you won&#x27;t see changes overnight! Be patient, do the treatments weekly, and you&#x27;ll see results in no time. You just need stick with it because nothing will give you instantaneous results overnight. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 5 months now.  I used to go to the dermatologist for the facial peels.  Due to financial reasons, I had to stop.  I found this product on-line and love it.  I have excessive oil production on my face due to genetics and due to medication.  My pores are large and I had frequent breakouts.  I&#x27;m a redhead.  Reds either have gorgeous skin or the totally opposite.  I try to follow the directions, but I&#x27;ve found that I need to leave the product on my skin longer than recommended.  It helps to dry my skin, peeling is minimal and any outbreaks are dried up within 12 hours.  As with the product used at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, this will burn for a few minutes.  I use a fan to help cool my skin.  This is a serious product - not for the new to peels user or someone who expects a day at the spa feel.</li>
            <li> zaps your zits and refreshes your face and skin. I wish I would&#x27;ve know about this stuff when I was younger. If I get a zit, I put it on and it&#x27;s all but gone the next morning. Even those super huge, r3ed swollen monsters that pop up that can take 2-3 weeks to heal are zapped overnight with this stuff. I put it on and I don&#x27;t rinse it off (just on the zit) and it&#x27;s gone next morning</li>
            <li> Your skin and mine are different, what works for you may not work for me and vice versa, as soon as you realize that, your road towards the skin you want and deserve will be a lot less frustrating and stress free.&lt;br /&gt;What you get? A little bottle filled with a clear liquid with a very heavy chemical smell, the only thing I can think of to compare it to would be nail polish remover (acetone).&lt;br /&gt;An in home chemical peel will not be your miracle in a bottle; you must take this as a part of a system/process; add this to your cleaning/moisturizing/protecting routine, you can&#x27;t expect to abuse your skin and apply this thing once a week and get a baby&#x27;s skin in return.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it once a week for 6 six weeks and then rest for 4 weeks and its actually during this rest time when I see the results, I&#x27;m not as oily/shiny as before, pores are smaller, break outs not as often and a more even skin tone, I&#x27;m actually very happy with what I see. All this improvements are progressive and accumulative, remember; you are not getting younger, you can&#x27;t expect to get to a point where you can say screw everything, I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m as good looking as I can be (or want) and I&#x27;m going to stay this way, You must continue taking care of yourself, always and as the time goes by you may need to make adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? Yes, does it work?  It does for me, are the results worth the trouble? In my case; yes, the results are subtle but noticeable, will this be the cure to all my ill? No, but a part.</li>
            <li> I have previously ordered this product. This has worked very well for me before I have acne, scars &amp; oil skin. I highly recommend this people to improve the texture &amp; appearance of acne scarred skin</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with sensitive skin.  But with a little sun damage(temples, forehead) and being 49, I decided to buy this peel.  This is a peel to use if you have already used a peel at home before, have older skin or  bad acne or scarring.  This is stronger, in my opinion, than peels I got at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office in my early 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This being said, I have used this peel 4 times and have been delighted in the results.  Smooth, fresh skin is what you get after its healed up.  But you have to realize that you need to be prepared beforehand with baking soda water mixture(1 or 2 tbsp in a little bowl of water) and a hair dryer to minimize the burning sensation on your skin.  I have only ever left this peel on about a minute on my face and neck.  It is very strong.  I left it on a little longer on my chest and hands.(which I also do each time) The baking soda neutralizes the acid and stops the burning sensation while rinsing your face well at the end of the minute.&lt;br /&gt;What one needs to realize is that if they are very sun damaged (tanning bed use for years etc) or very wrinkled, it is going to help, but not eliminate.  This is too strong for my daughter, who is 24.  She uses the 25% tca chemical peel for a little scarring and cystic acne.  It works well for her.&lt;br /&gt;After this peel is done, your face feels sunburned and tight.  Its annoying and I keep Aquaphor on at all times. You start peeling after about two days, so the less makeup, the better.  If all areas stay covered with Aquaphor or antibiotic ointment, your peeling is minimal.  Think sunburn with using it for a minute, not the awful red, oozy stuff you have seen online with chemical peels. In about 10 days, all the top layer of skin has come off and you are left with soft, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.  But use common sense and follow the directions and read reviews until you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what they are doing with this stuff. It is watery compared to other products. The label does not tell me what the % of the acids are and it smells very very toxic and burns my eyes and nose unlike any other individual peel I&#x27;ve used. I would return it if I could. It did nothing for me with very tough oily acne large pore skin with lots and lots of peel experience and nothing on friend with very fair, delicate, small pores but sun damaged skin with nearly zero peel experience. Very disppointed.</li>
            <li> Very mild peel, I can leave it on for an hour and no burning. However the results are much less drying and not as drastic as glycolic or lactic acid peels.</li>
            <li> Worst break out in my life. I dont know what to do. Chin and forehead are a mess.</li>
            <li> this product stung like crazy but i kept it on for 10 minutes straight anyway. the results were so so for me. i like the other salicylic acid better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for a couple of months now and REALLY love it!    I have tried the Glycolic and Lactic acids previously but this is by far stronger and gives me far quicker and definitive results.     I am almost 49 and still have very oily skin (little acne though) - I think this product is far better for us oily-skinned folks who really battle with clogged pores and excessive oil especially in the warmer months.    The stinging on my forehead is quite intense, but I have not suffered any ill effects because of it.  A few minutes is more than enough for me and I can see immediate results - I highly recommend this product for those with very oily skin and also any accompanying lines and soft wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and stubborn black heads.  This product is out standing.  I started with lactic acid gels peels which are really good but didn&#x27;t seem to help with black heads.  Withing one bha peel, I noticed less black heads and tighter pores.  It just keeps getting better and better and my skin is far less oily.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this company! I&#x27;ve ordered many times from them before and never had an issue until I received this shipment! First off, what they sent is a liquid, not a gel as they advertise here! Also, the content is not BHA, but simply rubbing alcohol! Way to try to rip people off, Skin Laboratories! Sneaking in some plain rubbing alcohol in your shipments hoping that some customers won&#x27;t realize that this is not a real peel! Not with me!! I have done many BHA peels before and I KNOW what a true BHA peel is. This is not!! This is just rubbing alcohol, does absolutely nothing! Returning the item today and will never order from this company again! You lost a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> My skin is still acne prone, this treatment once a week at most and mt skin is so much clearer</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail yesterday.  I bought it to reduce the lines on my forehead.  I was very skeptical at first because I have facials done but never saw any real results.  I used it last night and to my surprise my lines seem to be less deep and my skin looks very clean and renewed.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe it is wishful thinking and my eyes are tricking me but my husband noticed too.  Well, I am going to continue to use this product.  So far I am very satisfied.  It does burn a bit and the fumes are strong too.  So far it is worth it.  I will be following the directions carefully! Hope I look 20 by next month ;)</li>
            <li> very effective. careful with this product if you are using at home it is very strong and will cause peeling!</li>
            <li> This is a level four peel, so I was a little apprehensive. I peel A LOT when I do the salicylic 20% and that&#x27;s only a level one. I also tried the Glyco/Lac level two and not much happened. So I tried this one expecting major peeling and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening. I guess I&#x27;m confused about what the 1-4 system means, if it doesn&#x27;t actually indicate the depth of the peel. The directions say to leave it on for no longer than 4 minutes. I have worked up to three and have gotten a little sun burnt looking, but not much else. I&#x27;ll try it for a longer duration in a few days and if I get a better result, I will give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> If you cannot afford a dermatologist or do not have good medical insurance to visit one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the next best thing to going and getting a professional skin &#x27;peel&#x27;.  Very strong product - it will burn your skin if not used properly, so apply sparingly. Apply product carefully with a cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about two months, and my skin looks much better.  I am an african american male, that suffers from very sensative skin that becomes irritated from daily shaving, I suffer from ingrown facial hair that causes razor bumps, a day after shaving, dark blemishes and bumps appear around my neck and underneath my chin where I shave.  Since using the BHA peel.  It has really helped with the reduction of ingrown facial hair and it has lightened the dark blemishes of ingrown facial hair aftermath. And has almost cured my acne.  Areas like my forehead and cheeks are very clear and smooth and soft to the touch after regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results of fewer razor bumps.  This product has done more to cure my razor bumps than the $1500 dollars I spent in laser hair removal treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product has given me a nice even skin complexion.  Normally, I have a lighter brown skin complexion, but due to sensative skin, and razon bumps, my skin color is unbalanced, darker areas around my neck.  But since using this product, it has helped with my skin complextion giving it an even shade of lighter brown that matches my natural arm and hand chest skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the use of this product as an enhancement to an already \\&quot;in use\\&quot; skin routine such as the clarisonic MIA cleanser.  Only use the BHA product maybe once a week.  And then use the deep cleaning MIA scrubber maybe once a week after the BHA peel skin irritation has had time to settle.</li>
            <li> Use as directed.....the first time you put it on it feels a little freaky.  It stings and after one minute I rinsed with cold H2O as directed.  It seemed like the rinsing made the stinging intensify and that was a bit unnerving, but after about a dozen splashes I dried my face and the stinging subsided.  Now I leave it on for 4 minutes no problem.  It&#x27;s great for removing small blemishes and stops little break outs.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very good against acne breakout prevention and the diminishing of scars, but if you have dry skin, do not leave it on for longer than 2 minutes! Be prepared to have peeling for a solid week, but the plus is there is only a couple hour window of redness unlike other chemical peels. Overall, worth the negatives.</li>
            <li> just got the peel and only used it once bt be careful bcz it stings good deep into the epidermal layer.&lt;br /&gt;but i hope it clears my acne and the blemishes ......</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It cuts my oil production by 90%!  I use it about 1 time per week and my skin has never looked better.  Also has fadded my sun spots!</li>
            <li> I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before. I use this once a week...it make my skin so smooth.  My acne has gotten much better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  I started using this after my chemo treatment when my skin was dull, gray, and broken out.  Word of advice...it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...after that I am able to put it on for 3-5 minutes at a time with an increment of 1 minute each time.  I would start with 2 minutes depending on your skin type, mine is olive and it could tolerate a lot.  Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Follow directions  or you can get irritating results.  This is a great product, it&#x27;s the same as the $135.00 facial I received at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  follow with lots of cool water and your face will glow</li>
            <li> I think my BHA+ solution was expired because I have used this product in the past and it worked well. However, this time I applied the solution to my face as directed and I felt nothing. It was like I was putting oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using it for a while and it really has improved my face. I have oily skin and problem with acne and this has help to keep it clear and looking great.</li>
            <li> Works like a vitalize peel...if you apply it 2-3 days straight.  I will purchase again, as a vitalize peel is $150 vs. this product at $25.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of years sometime once a week or as a spot treatment for acne or marks. Really is very strong and does peel off a layer of skin but has never left my face burned (I have accidentally burned between my fingers, but nothing bad). Seems to have helped my skin which is prone to oil build-up and adult acne.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price compared to cheap ineffective drugstore products for those with cystic or severe acne. With patience and continued use you will have your acne under control.</li>
            <li> I have been using Glycolic Peels at the 50% grade for the past year.  The Glycolic works for fine lines and wrinkles.  However, I have struggled with big pores.  I used the peel last night and noticed immediate burning when I put it on.  Having a cool fan blowing on your face helps with the stinging.  I than rinsed the peel with cold water mixed with Baking Soda.  After the rinse I noticed some redness and little ice look over some areas of skin,  I woke up this morning and noticed that my huge pores that have been a problem area all over my face, have shrunk substantially.  I thought this product would be like the Glycolic Peels and take several to notice any results.  For me?  This product is amazing.  I can&#x27;t wait to do another pore treatment with it next week.  I am going to be 42 years old.  Hope others have the same amazing results as I have!</li>
            <li> I must have the worst skin ever, because it didn&#x27;t burn me at ALL when I put this on. Actually, it felt quite pleasant! Then again...I&#x27;m used to chemical peels at this point so they don&#x27;t bother me like they used to. My face isn&#x27;t even red. To be honest, I wish they made a stronger peel for people like me. I guess its back to the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I love this product! You can see the difference the next day! Regular use shows on your skin.  You will like it when you use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it suppose to do but I do suggest you start with something that&#x27;s not as strong as this on yet to get your skin use to this stuff because it burns like HELL at first until your skin get adjusted to it.</li>
