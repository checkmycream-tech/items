            <li>Really great Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Davines Love is the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>none of them are as good as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>It also smells so amazing that you don&#x27;t need to wear perfume</li>
            <li>LOVE Love!</li>
            <li>Would easily by 5 stars if they included a pump!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Davine&#x27;s Love Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for 4 or 5 years.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have gotten on how my hair smells.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>My hair is amazing when I use it!!&lt;br /&gt;But, please note that this is  just the large jar of it ...</li>
            <li>My suspicions were confirmed when I called the company and they told me that the serial numbers stamped on the bottom were not their serial numbers.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a way to verify in advance that the product is genuine.</li>
            <li>always my favorite conditioner worth the money</li>
            <li>I have been buying this conditioner for years of of amazon and it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>and I say this as someone who doesn&#x27;t love to spend so much money on cleansing/beauty products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairdresser and even pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and soft - love the smell.</li>
            <li>My new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>i have pretty much tried all of the grocery store brands and most  of the designer salon brands.</li>
            <li>that said, this &#x27;love&#x27; conditioner should only be for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money -</li>
            <li>Finally - this does not have an overly flowery odor, but more of a grapefruit-ey, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so glad I found the larger size at Amazon and saved well over 50%.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve compared it to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; conditioner from the salon and its pretty identical.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner so much that I bought the king-size bottle to use as a refill for my smaller container.</li>
            <li>I love Davines Products and have been using them for a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 large bottles of this conditioner and a large bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li>Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Conditioner, Medium Texture, 13 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li>Smells incredible and leave my dyed blonde hair silky and thick.</li>
            <li>Great smoothing conditioner- the only conditioner that my super- thick, dryness prone hair loves!  </li>
            <li>i did not purchase my davines love conditioner online, but at a reputable salon, so there is no way it was fake.</li>
            <li>So, we &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; - meaning we run conditioner through the ends, or just after scalp and through the ends, and then right before the final rinse, we go at the scalp.</li>
            <li>this is why i have tried them ALL, but always use the l&#x27;oreal in between trying new conditioners.</li>
            <li>The smell was odd for a Davines product because my experience is that all of the ones I have used in the past were great.</li>
            <li>I expect this large, economy size to last me well over a year.</li>
            <li>-- and these products are definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I was buying the smaller one through a salon and paying twice as much..</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have curly, frizzy hair and this leaves it so moisturized and soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>Heavy and hair was opposite of smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday (the 8oz) and it lasted me a little more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give the real thing 5 stars, hands down, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks awesome all the time - no more frizzies or bad hair days.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but you only need a little bit at a time to have get results as it is very concentrated.</li>

            <li> For us, washing our hair daily can dry it out and increase the frizz.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m curious why it is a different color than what was pictured and what I have used before.  </li>

            <li> unfortunately, if u use one conditioner too much, your hair gets used to it---</li>
            <li> The supplier I bought this from watered down the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bargain when you&#x27;re also getting a half quality product.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s a little painful to get the product out, especially as you use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too late for you, though.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this affected the smell of the product, or the way that it feels and functions - I hope not!</li>
            <li> the product is very thick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased 2 large bottles of this conditioner and a large bottle of shampoo --over $150! -- and these products are definitely not the real thing. They are fake. My suspicions were confirmed when I called the company and they told me that the serial numbers stamped on the bottom were not their serial numbers. It is too late for me to get my money back. It&#x27;s not too late for you, though. Please, if you want this shampoo &amp; conditioner, buy it in a salon, which will guarantee them.    I&#x27;d give the real thing 5 stars, hands down, but this isn&#x27;t it. Be careful!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and soft - love the smell.</li>
            <li> The name says it all --- this conditioner puts the \\&quot;Love\\&quot; into your hair - it not only tames, it nourishes. I have coarse hair with a slight wave that often gets unruly in humid weather. With this conditioner, the texture of my hair is actually finer and straighter. It is pricey but you only need a little bit at a time to have get results as it is very concentrated. I previously got the smallest size and it lasted me for over 6 months of use every other day. I expect this large, economy size to last me well over a year. Finally - this does not have an overly flowery odor, but more of a grapefruit-ey, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I love Davines Products and have been using them for a long time. I found this particular product to have a very unpleasant odor and a absolute disaster for fine curly hair. My hair was limp and straight after using a small drop. The smell was odd for a Davines product because my experience is that all of the ones I have used in the past were great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife as a gift.  She loves the product!!!  Arrived on time.  Will orfer again!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful smell and feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Davine&#x27;s Love Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for 4 or 5 years.  I will never switch to another product.</li>
            <li> Run dont walk to buy this conditioner! I have corkscrew curly hair and this product was recommended to me in a Beverly Hills hair supply shop. Shopkeeper said it is their #1 best seller for curly-haired people.     Absolutely worth the money - and I say this as someone who doesn&#x27;t love to spend so much money on cleansing/beauty products. My hair looks awesome all the time - no more frizzies or bad hair days. I use it everyday (the 8oz) and it lasted me a little more than 3 months. It also smells so amazing that you don&#x27;t need to wear perfume and you will be complimented on how great you smell. . . It is pretty heavy but someone with thick curly hair will not have a problem using too much of this.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so much that I bought the king-size bottle to use as a refill for my smaller container. I also use this product to &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;, which is a secret of wavy/curly haired people. For us, washing our hair daily can dry it out and increase the frizz. So, we &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; - meaning we run conditioner through the ends, or just after scalp and through the ends, and then right before the final rinse, we go at the scalp. This can happen every day, or you can occasionally use shampoo on the scalp (usually only) if it looks weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have gotten on how my hair smells. Strangers stop me on the street to ask what product I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Davines did a formula change recently and this product is not lavender in color. I am not sure if this affected the smell of the product, or the way that it feels and functions - I hope not!</li>
            <li> Heavy and hair was opposite of smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> By the larger package at Amazon and save over 50%... I was buying the smaller one through a salon and paying twice as much..so glad I found the larger size at Amazon and saved well over 50%. It was shipped and received by the next day...Awesome service!</li>
            <li> The supplier I bought this from watered down the product. When I&#x27;ve purchased this in the salon the product is very thick. Beauty Perfect sent me a watery product in a bottle that wasn&#x27;t sealed. It&#x27;s not a bargain when you&#x27;re also getting a half quality product. I think the salon version is wonderful. I wish there were a way to verify in advance that the product is genuine.</li>
            <li> I received this product today so I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m curious why it is a different color than what was pictured and what I have used before.  I spent quite abit of money so hope it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and even pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this conditioner for years of of amazon and it has never disappointed me. I read a review on here that said this product is fake but I dont think so. I can verify it but I&#x27;ve compared it to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; conditioner from the salon and its pretty identical.</li>
            <li> best shampoo for my fuzzy hair (and I have tried a lot)</li>
            <li> Really great Conditioner.  Been buying this for a long while.</li>
            <li> i did not purchase my davines love conditioner online, but at a reputable salon, so there is no way it was fake. that said, this &#x27;love&#x27; conditioner should only be for fine hair. i do not know why the company does not make this distinction in the description for this product. i have thick, wavy hair, and this conditioner did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me.&lt;br /&gt;my thick hair gets dry and tangled from highlights, so i am always looking for new conditioners- i have pretty much tried all of the grocery store brands and most  of the designer salon brands. the best one from the davines collection is the &#x27;momo&#x27; conditioner. still, nothing, not the bumble&amp;bumble, not the aveda, not the bed head...none of them are as good as the [[ASIN:B004INCW2O L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Conditioner, Medium Texture, 13 Fluid Ounce]]. the only one that comes close is [[ASIN:B000BIVY2Y CIMENT ANTI-USURE]]--- but that is a l&#x27;oreal product as well. they are the only products that detangle my hair when i run it through with water. unfortunately, if u use one conditioner too much, your hair gets used to it--- this is why i have tried them ALL, but always use the l&#x27;oreal in between trying new conditioners.</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo.  My Morocan Oil is sitting on the shelf.  Davines Love is the best conditioner I have ever used.  Additionally, this conditioner makes my daughters knots slide away!</li>
            <li> Great smoothing conditioner- the only conditioner that my super- thick, dryness prone hair loves!  Now it&#x27;s smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> always my favorite conditioner worth the money</li>
            <li> Best brand and conditioner ever! I have curly, frizzy hair and this leaves it so moisturized and soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the bomb!  My hair is amazing when I use it!!&lt;br /&gt;But, please note that this is  just the large jar of it ... it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump.  So, it&#x27;s a little painful to get the product out, especially as you use it and there is less product left.  Would easily by 5 stars if they included a pump!</li>
            <li> LOVE Love! Smells incredible and leave my dyed blonde hair silky and thick. I swear by Davines!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 6 years.  It&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for a couple of years now.  I also usethe Davines smoothing shampoo.  Smells great and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
