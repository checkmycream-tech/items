            <li>It&#x27;s a great starter kit and the instructions are amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a good Starter kit for Shellac.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good started</li>
            <li>I loved the gel polish manicures and I get it done at the salon all the time.  </li>
            <li>I did watch a u-tube video on the process which I also believe made it easier, and also gave some good tips.  </li>
            <li>Some kits have a mini-dvd; good luck with *that* thing.</li>
            <li>I bought an LED light (look around for best price!)</li>
            <li>Just helps make it look good longer</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need the ProBond IBD and IBD Bonder (superior to Gelish)</li>
            <li>It cures flawlessly in the Gelish light.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need the ProBond IBD and IBD Bonder (superior to Gelish)</li>
            <li>It cures flawlessly in the Gelish light.</li>
            <li>I get good results with Lomasi color whether using my Gelish base/top or the Lomasi brand.</li>
            <li>The brushes in the bottles are superior to the dinky Gelish/Red Carpet brushes.</li>
            <li>I have been battling gorgeous nails all my life - and had to resort to acrylics -</li>
            <li>u spicy gel light and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It literally sticks that good.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I got home and polish still looked good but was growing out so needed to come off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great kit to get started and see if you want to do your own at home shellac mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that I can have nice looking nails again.</li>
            <li>Now my friends are amazed that my nails I did at home look as good as theirs that they spend a lot of money on.</li>
            <li>Find a good TV show or put on some music.</li>
            <li>Find a good TV show or put on some music.</li>
            <li>Loved the file ti came with too</li>
            <li>It was still a good deal.</li>
            <li>good for a week</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li>but I do like it, seems to work good.  </li>
            <li>and I have good eye sight.  </li>
            <li>good bang for the buck..</li>
            <li>But it pays for itself AND it looks as good as if someone certified is doing them.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so good.</li>
            <li>Get a good \\&quot;cap\\&quot; on the ends of the nails, even if it gets on the skin of your finger tips- that will peel off without effect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for anyone wanting to start doing their own nails at home</li>
            <li>Worked good</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>But I do think this is a good way to decide if you like a product or not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good beginner kit.</li>
            <li>and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  </li>
            <li>While it takes some time, my nails look good for around two weeks.</li>
            <li>Curing Light Timer 36 Watts and the combo was perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good beginning for your nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brand</li>
            <li>This is a good starter kit.</li>
            <li>Loved us this product.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>They come all in one and good product.</li>
            <li>the good part is you don&#x27;t have to purchase separately.</li>
            <li>it was good</li>

            <li>Good starter kit.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I used a cheap eye liner brush and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li>and I continue to use it time after time and to refill products because they are so good.</li>
            <li>I found some really good instructions and I have had my gel polish on for 3 days now.</li>
            <li>Perfect for replacement for original one</li>
            <li>This is an excellent way to get familiar with the Gelish products, without the upfront investment.  </li>
            <li>Went on vacation for 3 weeks and was able to keep my manicure beautiful.</li>
            <li>This removes the tackiness leaving you with beautiful smooth, sleek, shiny nails!  </li>
            <li>It still looks nice, and will continue doing my own maicures now that I have the resources!  </li>
            <li>They still look perfect through two nights of bartending at my part time and three days of typing at my full time job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and a very good product.</li>
            <li>I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick sample, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>, I was really wanting to start doing gel nails myself at home, and by reviews, this was the best kit, and everyone suggested gelish, so that&#x27;s what I went with, and this kit is great</li>
            <li>and/or a polish is the sensational kit, but</li>
            <li>This is the perfect combo and size to try out for the first time the Gelish experience!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the way they turned out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very glad i tried it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will continue using the gel on my nails, foundation and top just because it makes me happy.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great kit, cheaper priced than most beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>but I love a great manicure.</li>
            <li>, my nails are very healthy, but when i apply the foundation/base code(mind</li>
            <li>I have heard many great things about this product and cannot wait to try it.</li>
            <li>If you are good with polishing and filing your own nails, then this is just o.k.</li>
            <li>I love this product and love the compliments I get on my nails!!</li>
            <li>and everyone is using gel on top of their acrylic nails, so decided to buy here where the price is way better than Sally&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to take care of my own nails, but this kit is great for learning how to do it.</li>
            <li>Also a great place to start to be sure you want to do your own manicures/pedicures.  </li>
            <li>This kit is perfect for first timers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed though, as there is plenty of product in the kit to get you through MANY manicures!</li>
            <li>First, this seller is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>it turned out perfect the first time i tried it.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to get some more colors!</li>

            <li>Love Gelish!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this kit!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Make sure not to get any on the skin, if you do use the stick to wipe it off before curing!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li>Just follow the steps and DO NOT get the Foundation or the Top Coat on your skin!</li>
            <li>It is also helpful because for a beginner, it made sure I had everything I needed to be successful at doing this at home.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>If I can get a week I will be pleased!  </li>
            <li>Gelish is my favorite soak of polish kit!</li>
            <li>I love getting no-chip manicures but it can get pricey!  </li>
            <li>am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>

            <li>Great system its as easy as painting your nails.  </li>
            <li>this polish is so easy to use &amp; it looks great</li>
            <li>Pure acetone seems to work best.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my manicure and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>the color looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing was how shiny it still was, and I&#x27;m a klutz with my hands, not to mention I wash my hands 10 million times a week, it seems, being in the health care field and I garden, etc.</li>
            <li>I used a UV light with this polish and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This kit is a great way to try it out without a huge commitment.</li>
            <li>This kit is a great way to try it out without a huge commitment.</li>
            <li>I am happy that someone made this polish available for the diy girl.  </li>
            <li>I use a 36W UV light and it works great with the Gelish products.</li>
            <li>The Gelish Nail kit is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon for a great product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I save lots of time &amp; money now that I do my own nails.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>nice starter kit.</li>
            <li>Most compliments with \\&quot;Good</li>
            <li>but that has been for my own practice.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping I could do my own gel manis at home.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails now and they look nice</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on them.&lt;br /&gt;*Next</li>
            <li>No sense in looking like you bring your own Frito chips to the party.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that if you have had some lifting at the edge, this helps make a nice seal.&lt;br /&gt;*Then</li>
            <li>Honestly I prefer IBD over Gelish for their brush, application, durability, and opacity.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Honestly I prefer IBD over Gelish for their brush, application, durability, and opacity.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have included a colour  in the box as well.</li>
            <li>Just started doing my own gels.</li>
            <li>Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so well</li>
            <li>A number of years ago I went to a salon where they did this kind of gel system.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nails for almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>Doing your own gel nails has a bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li>Her manicure has lasted over three weeks and her nails are growing nicely.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I might as well bite them since they don&#x27;t look nice anyway.  </li>
            <li>I am getting used to using it and getting that nice gel polish finish on my nails.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have all the products that you need in one kit.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nails for over a year now</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>I had been going to a nail salon and did not want to pay $30 every 2 weeks to keep my nails looking nice.</li>
            <li>Everything was packaged nicely and I got it before the date I was supposed too which was nice.</li>
            <li>I do have to kind of scrape off the product.  </li>
            <li>had to go on youtube and research on my own to figure out how to and what to use each bottle</li>
            <li>Now that I have my own</li>
            <li>If you can paint your own nails without painting your cuticles and fingers than this is for you.  </li>
            <li>So bottom line if you can paint your own nails then you can do this.  </li>
            <li>handy</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always been a DIY kind of girl</li>
            <li>i bought this to start my own gel nail collection....</li>
            <li>This pack is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already blown up all my facebook friends about doing your own gel polish using this Gelish kit...</li>
            <li>After using my daughter-in-law&#x27;s Gelish Basix Kit and loving the results, I decided to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li>If you can paint your own nails, you can do this.</li>
            <li>I have had Gelish done at the nail salon and liked it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it worked perfect and my nails looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess she liked it...</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you are going to do your own gel nails.</li>
            <li>It has everything I needed to start doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li>I got this kit because I wanted to give doing my own gel polish a try.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit to attempt doing my own gel nails.  </li>
            <li>I have never used any kind of nail product except polish before.</li>
            <li>The polish came off, after soaking of course, quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to those who want to do their own nails.</li>
            <li>Includes all the basics and sets you right on tract to beautiful gel manicure.</li>
            <li>CAN GET THE FULL SIZED KIT INCLUDED WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE MINI GELISH KIT FOR COUPLE MORE BUCKS!!</li>
            <li>It was very easy.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was so looking forward to trying out my Gelish kit, but when I got it in the mail, the envelope itself smelled VERY strongly of acetone.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use all you need to do is stay on your nail.</li>
            <li>Using it at home proved to be very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I love this and love doing my nails!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll need, in addition to the kit: a UV or LED lamp, lint free nail polish removal pads, a microfine buffer, 70% alcohol would also be good.</li>
            <li>Loved that the bottles were huge.</li>
            <li>, I suggest you purchase your own mini kit and follow the directions precisely!  </li>
            <li>I liked this kit for the most part.</li>
            <li>My friends who had it done had great success...</li>
            <li>Make sure all your supplies are handy, including some paper towels and the sticks to get in the cracks.</li>
            <li>Make sure all your supplies are handy, including some paper towels and the sticks to get in the cracks.</li>
            <li>a good light (uv or led</li>
            <li>Package arrived early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Both are perfect for the professional environment.</li>
            <li>I have never been particularly gifted when it comes to painting my own nails</li>
            <li>The product did exactly what it was supposed to do and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I wasn&#x27;t really sure what all I needed to do my own gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>you will probably want to invest in a nail brush set, which I ordered on here, and was really cheap and good quality</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product, just wish the people shipping it did more to protect the items in the package</li>
            <li>, we had to watch a you tube video on which bottle to use first but works good, her nail look good.</li>
            <li>It is SOOO EASY!</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s really easy to do!</li>
            <li>I love gelish nail products and it has everthing except the light to get you off to a good start.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased I ordered a couple more colors and will continue to to my own gel manicures from here on out.</li>
            <li>Super excited to be using this gel kit!!!</li>
            <li>Never having applied gel nails before, and learning how, this product is easy to apply and my customers love it!  </li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow, and I love the results!  </li>
            <li>So happy right now :-)</li>
            <li>First time doing gel nails on myself and this starter kit was great.</li>
            <li>For a first time buyer, this kit is great.</li>
            <li>Made for a great gift, and it worked really well!  </li>
            <li>Gives you a good idea of how this product works for you before you invest in the full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Doing my right hand took quite some time, but now I’ve developed great fine motor control and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re easy to use - on the box it gives instructions on the order in which to apply them and the UV curing times, so I just line them up in that order before I start my manicure and have the box handy for the # of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I did my own gel nails, and they look as good as they did at the salon.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and cost effective for me.</li>
            <li>Great idea for new customers who are trying out the routine of doing their own gel nails.</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful and it came super quick, in just two days.</li>
            <li>very good product, durable, and for natural nails.</li>
            <li>I got it like more than 4 months</li>
            <li>Also, the top it off solution brush would continuously need to be wiped off (causing most of the product to end up in the garbage)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting out, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>One thing I wondered before buying was how many applications this mini kit would provide...</li>
            <li>the pamphlet inside says 15-20 applications which is an amazing savings (even with the purchase of a uv light) over the cost of a salon application.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it.</li>
            <li>I hope gelish comes out with more polish colors and/or polish color kits.</li>
            <li>but I was able to do the steps and touch it up.   </li>
            <li>but I got way, way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I also use the builder gel (Harmony and IBD) to build my own nails and this light works with those too.</li>
            <li>Put the decal on top of your color, before you put on the top coat and cure.</li>
            <li>By the time you add another two coats of color plus your top coat, you cannot tell there is a heavier layer on your tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the Shellac applies, how it cures, and how it wears.</li>
            <li>It is compatible with Gelish top and foundation coats.</li>
            <li>The decorative topcoats (unlike Gelish) most often provide the PUNCH you are looking for with one coat.</li>
            <li>and Gelish would share the top spot for application, endurance</li>

            <li>The decorative topcoats (unlike Gelish) most often provide the PUNCH you are looking for with one coat.</li>
            <li>but I think I like the Lomasi brand of color better.</li>
            <li>Lomasi is slightly more costly but the application and wear are top notch.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy more</li>
            <li>I love how the Shellac applies, how it cures, and how it wears.</li>
            <li>Most Shellac colors I have had to cure longer than with Gelish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Gelish and Shellac would share the top spot for application, endurance, some Gelish has opacity problems but just follow my trick for the horizontal tip-painting and see how that works for you</li>
            <li>I had to find something better in this economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In using it myself, I love this system and prefer it over paying $30 a pop in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it since I&#x27;m a novice.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t go for the set I suggest you purchase the foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li>I always love gellish polish and gellish itself.  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on them!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I love this starter set for helping me learn the process of Gelish nails.  </li>
            <li>When you put on the top coat, cure it, and cleanse your nails, you are done.</li>
            <li>I actually love the product its the customer service that sux...</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve, but I love my nails now.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a color separately, a UV lamp as well as gloves without fingertips, but it was all worth it for gorgeous nails.  </li>
            <li>Great service and got it fast.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE GELISH</li>
            <li>I have used it for 2 months now and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>Cotton balls will get fibers on your nails so make sure you get lint-free nail wipes and a 180 grit file to use with this kit.</li>
            <li>but I love the finish it gives.</li>
            <li>I like using a buffer block, it gets in the creases better.</li>
            <li>Again, make sure not to get any on the nail or cuticle, but get as close as you can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply top coat.</li>
            <li>Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li>This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration.</li>
            <li>This will prevent the excess from dripping in the creases, make it cure better and make it look better.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I bit them, peeled them and they weren’t cute at all.</li>
            <li>Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li>This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration.</li>

            <li>I bit them, peeled them and they weren’t cute at all.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the company sent this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I am expecting three more colors soon.  </li>
            <li>Gelish needs to do a better job with this.</li>
            <li>love the oil</li>
            <li>Happy with the starter kit and good bargain compared to what local beauty store was charging for it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li>They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>There are a lot more gels on the market now, but this is still one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li>It may work better with Gelish nail color.</li>
            <li>enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>there was no way I was able to read them</li>
            <li>I bought this size for my teen and its perfect!</li>
            <li>, many ppl skip the phbond</li>
            <li>I used both on the same set and got perfect results from both.</li>
            <li>I wish this basic kit came with a polish color, but otherwise it works out great!</li>
            <li>takes about an hour to soak off though, but better than CND and not watery at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this brand&#x27;s top quality for a fraction of the cost in stores.</li>
            <li>and you will be able to do this at home.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Although box came factory sealed, one of the bottles (top it off) inside</li>
            <li>Top It Off</li>
            <li>Love this product and works just like in the salons.</li>
            <li>to get more colors.</li>
            <li>but I was able to watch a you tube video.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Paint on the Top if Off Sealer  11.</li>
            <li>Cure under lamp for 180 secs to make sure it is well cured.  </li>
            <li>COAT AND TOP COAT</li>
            <li>It is helpful to keep cuticles from drying out and maintain a healthy (and healtly looking) cuticle.  </li>
            <li>More colors (better colors)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Their is a nourish step that makes cuticles feel healthy</li>
            <li>Top It Off (top coat)&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>PH Bond prep is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li>The foundation appears to be a bit thicker than the top coat.</li>
            <li>Nail Surface Cleanse appears to be mostly Isopropyl Alcohol with some Acetone thrown in.</li>

            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure I use gloves doing dishes and laundry to keep the manicure looking nicer longer.</li>
            <li>Will post again when I have some more feedback on wear and tear.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li>One thing to note is that your nails will be tacky after using the top it off coat.</li>
            <li>They were more at sophora though.</li>
            <li>every things ok</li>
            <li>it help me better for my work.</li>
            <li>Love the kit, it has everything I need to do my nails just like a salon.  </li>
            <li>Foundation seems way more gummy and it will take some practice I guess on applying thinner coats?</li>
            <li>but it was more like 2 days</li>
            <li>She was pleased with how the products worked.</li>
            <li>You will be able to do your nail many times.  </li>
            <li>Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li>but if your just starting off its perfect!</li>
            <li>I love everything you get with this starter kit.</li>
            <li>and you shouldn&#x27;t be touching them anyways</li>
            <li>Love the gelish nail color...</li>
            <li>I would for sure buy this product again from this seller</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s everything you&#x27;ll need to get started without the pigment</li>
            <li>I guess she enjoyed the kit to go with her dryer</li>
            <li>Bought this mostly for doing pedicures.</li>
            <li>Anyway, although the product seems ok it would not cure.</li>
            <li>My problem is more with my tips popping off than the Gelish product</li>
            <li>Buy their $5 membership card to save even more.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing how shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>I would make sure to give your nails time to breathe between wearings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love Gelish.</li>
            <li>I love this product and because I saw a review on You Tube</li>
            <li>My sister wanted to try out doing her own gel nails with a UV light.</li>
            <li>However, she didn&#x27;t want to make a huge investment into it until she decided how she liked it.</li>
            <li>Would love to hear what amazon has to say about this.</li>
            <li>(I paid $34.99, the non prime product with free shipping is $29.99) since the 2 day shipping that was promised was not delivered on!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use more colors.</li>
            <li>I already did a better job to do my mom&#x27; snail</li>
            <li>My problem was need better directions, than ones on bottles.  </li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I would like more color choices as well.</li>
            <li>I bought replacements and love the results.</li>
            <li>I need to practice more.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT,</li>
            <li>, NO CHIPPING OR PEALING, LOOKS SO SHINY,  LOVE IT</li>
            <li>everything needed included, however I have ordered more tips on here as well and a clipper</li>
            <li>Best product I bought last year!~</li>
            <li>I capped the free edge and everything!</li>
            <li>Nails were left in excellent condition post removal.</li>
            <li>I will need to get better at the application process, but that will come with practice.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this kit.  </li>
            <li>So so so pleased.  </li>
            <li>ie styrofoam, plastic wrapped around glass-- ANYTHING more than just sending glass bottles in a box that moves around.</li>
            <li>followed those steps to a T and my nails look better than I&#x27;ve ever seen them before.</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>I love my kit</li>
            <li>but good product honestly all you really need is the top coat</li>
            <li>your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The interesting thing about the gel is how strong it is, how strong it makes your nails (I had to clip my nails to shorten them, they were so break-proof!).</li>
            <li>Still using this original kit after 10 months of doing my own gel nails.  </li>
            <li>been using this as a first timer it works good and love it...</li>
            <li>This was a good deal because it gave you everything you needed to be able to do a gel manicure/pedicure at home without purchasing each item individually at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>A great system if you can afford a decent 36V UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cotton ball method is cheap and very easy.</li>
            <li>lol if you want a high uv shine</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow, the colors are great and the product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to save money by doing my own nails and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t come off quickly as I thought.  </li>
            <li>No complaints especially because with the light I purchased I am able to have beautiful nails in 15 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li>I think it is pretty good brand to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been very easy to do and fun!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it, invest in the kit, some colors, and a dryer and save yourself $30 every three weeks!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this kit!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this item here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>So excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li>My nails look great until new growth gets obnoxious.</li>
            <li>but today I got brave, opened the packages and went to YouTube and watched a couple of videos on how to both take off my existing gel as well as put on a new set.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to follow the directions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and had no problems with removing the gel polish and my natural nails were in great</li>
            <li>They feel like a very durable version of a good quality top coat.</li>
            <li>The product works great and doing my own nails was simple but time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I liked the kit very much and it has lasted and looks just like my nails were done at a salon!  </li>
            <li>I received my kit and polish today, did my own nails for the first time with the gelish gel polish and it turned out perfectly and took no longer than a regular manicure.</li>
            <li>The set was a great deal, the price was right and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I said, this kit is a great kit, and gelish is the most popular brand, and you can also pick up the items at sally&#x27;s if you run out of something they normally have all of it in stock, and you don&#x27;t have time to order on here, and they sell the polish&#x27;s as well, which makes it pretty convinent.</li>
            <li>sure they will be fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine , its more so for a person that has alot of time.</li>
            <li>One more tip--be sure to clean any polish off your skin before curing.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Gelish line and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to take your time and follow all the steps and you will have a chip free manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good at diy beauty and enjoy it, I can see some people not taking their time or reading the instructions with this.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need more than 2 layers on your nail bed MOST of the time, but the tips are where you need opacity: with this horizontal first-layer method, you can get full color on your tips with no shine-through, and still get by with two coats on your nail bed, which helps stave off bubbling and lifting.</li>

            <li>Oh yes, make sure you wipe any product off of your skin before curing in the UV or LED light.  </li>

            <li>Be sure to use a lint free cloth.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Thermal Spa 49135 light and love it.  </li>

            <li>kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish.  </li>
            <li>You will run out of these things before running out of the foundation and top coat, but they&#x27;re cheap to replace.</li>
            <li>At the end, after you have cured the top coat, take a lent free pad soaked in cleanser, and wipe off the tacky residue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I really love this products, wished they would make the product that doesn&#x27;t require a UV light</li>
            <li>I then applied the top coat and this time I used the UV light for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good value and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>, I was really trying to be good wearing gloves to do the dishes</li>
            <li>But still love their rich, quality colors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be creative and have fun!</li>
            <li>Other than that, its perfect!!</li>
            <li>I had to buy a replacement at the store, but other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>I easily found some online though.</li>

            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The polish is easily removed with NON-acetone remover and won&#x27;t affect the gel nail underneath.</li>
            <li>At that point, the polish is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have noticed because if you do not put a lot on your cotton pad then it does not come off as easily</li>
            <li>But it was easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>It was quite easy.  </li>
            <li>This kit is SO EASY to use</li>
            <li>It was SO EASY.</li>

            <li>, it smelled so strong --</li>
            <li>The lamp is still going strong too with</li>
            <li>, the removal agent is STRONG.</li>
            <li>Strong for nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the water decals for many reasons (mainly because it wets the gel layer) but you can use them if you have much more patience than I do!</li>
            <li>The nice thing about gel color, is how STICKY it is, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get a decal on without lifting.</li>
            <li>She gets very creative with her nails and it is so much cheaper than taking her to the salon.</li>
            <li>I think Gelish made this kit perfectly for the average person.</li>
            <li>You are much better off buying the full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>but it was my first time preparing my own gel manicure</li>
            <li>, they still looked fine after 3 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I got this product and used it and it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>They look much better than when I do my own nails with normal polish, because you can wipe off the mistakes before curing and</li>
            <li>either one is fine</li>
            <li>Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>which was fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I also experiment around more with designs now since the process is so quick.</li>
            <li>The top coat makes your nail so super shiny.  </li>
            <li>Hey, lucky me!</li>
            <li>Hey, lucky me!</li>
            <li>Newest Super Mini Cute Portable 6W LED Gel Polish Nail Dryer -- it was about $20 bucks and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very strong, shiny, cure well, and are pretty easy to use-I didn&#x27;t even watch the DVD tutorial, but I will.</li>
            <li>For more experienced, you may want the full size bottles of the specific products you&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>I did my first gelish last night on my own and it worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I now know what I need, I&#x27;ll probably buy the items separately next time, but again, I&#x27;m happy with them because the process was easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use.</li>
            <li>The Nail Remover is just acetone for the most part (also available at Walmart/Target for super cheap).  </li>
            <li>Perfect for trying a little sampler.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making an easy user friendly product.</li>
            <li>I have found the times listed on each step to be accurate.</li>
            <li>Includes everything you need to get started EXCEPT the light and color gel</li>
            <li>They break easy and I work out a lot and clean a lot which doesnt help the nails.  </li>
            <li>The Gelish system is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got fantastic results using a 14 watt uv light I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>You need a UV light as well, which I also ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great starter kit.</li>
            <li>You just need to add a color and a light.</li>
            <li>The product looks really nice on your fingers and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li>THE HASSLE GET THE GELISH LIGHT)</li>
            <li>: Just save yourself the money and buy the Gelish light.  </li>
            <li>but once I got the Gelish light, I stopped having ANY issues whatsoever with any brand.</li>
            <li>Then take the &#x27;nail cleaner&#x27; (or 91% alcohol) product on your lint free cloth and swipe your nails.</li>
            <li>I also have UV light</li>
            <li>(UPDATE: The Gelish light solved every problem I ever</li>
            <li>I find I have to cure them 30 seconds each coat with the Gelish light.</li>
            <li>I find I have to cure them 30 seconds each coat with the Gelish light.</li>
            <li>But I did use LED light for this.</li>
            <li>I have since found that I prefer the dramatically shortened cure time (and longevity of the light) of the LED.</li>
            <li>Two coats, smooth and opaque and they STICK.</li>
            <li>I use a cotton free towel which has worked well.  </li>
            <li>Great starter kit to use the Gelish products and to help decide which products you will continue to use and which products you will supplement with similar items (I.e. rubbing alcohol, acetone).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to not run the products up on the cuticle, as that is another place for it to lift and peel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Basix Kit contains everything (besides the UV lamp, and lint free wipes) that you need to get started at home.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford to get gel manicures at $36 every two weeks, so I bought this kit, one light harmony gelish color</li>

            <li>I bought the U/V light</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit, one Gelish color, and a 48 watt UV light.  </li>
            <li>If the nail is still smooth and shiny it will probably lift early.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li>[...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget that you need a gel cure light, not included.  </li>

            <li>The outside shipping box was intact but smelled very nice inside, like a musky/minty perfume.  </li>
            <li>i do recommend this product for first timers until you get the hang of the what portions you need for yourself, and if you are great portion control this can last fro many applications</li>
            <li>So frustrating because the color and shine was beautiful but what good is it if i can&#x27;t enjoy a week manicure let alone</li>
            <li>After doing much research, shellac nails are the new and best way to go - gel can do much damage.  </li>

            <li>I have used the Gelish system mainly with ibd gel polishes which they work AMAZING together</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried to remove and it was super easy to do at home.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the new LED light I bought, or the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curing them for up to 4 minuntes!  </li>
            <li>I used a Bounty paper towel instead of special lint free wipes and had no problems with lint</li>
            <li>Then the second time I tried it the foundation still worked great, but the top it off got really sticky and gummy.  </li>
            <li>might find the instructions overwhelming at first</li>
            <li>so I was somewhat familiar with the process.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep doing my own nails!</li>
            <li>My first manicure turned out flawless, and I did a French manicure on myself for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied with the kit.</li>

            <li>This system promises to deliver that, and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe how shiny the polish stays for so long, it&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want to worry about having your hands in water doing dishes or</li>
            <li>Has everything needed and quality is pretty satisfying.</li>
            <li>Be aware that yes, the layers stay tacky until you put on the top coat.  </li>

            <li>Unless you already are familiar with the process of applying gels you&#x27;re probably going to have to do this because the kit does not come with instructions.  </li>

            <li>I read many reviews about this product and decided to get it based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li>And I used it right away!</li>
            <li>I am a DIY&#x27;er, I do my own toenails with a french and understand that not all people have time of patience for that, but the gelish system is very easy, very fast.  </li>
            <li>There are a few steps but the product&#x27;s consistency makes perfect application super easy, and it&#x27;s very easy to fix mistakes, should you make them, prior to curing the layers.  </li>
            <li>Do a little research before you get started and he results are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It removed just the white polish very easily!  </li>

            <li>My natural nails have a nice shape but are so flimsy that they can&#x27;t survive the rigors of my job, hobbies, or day to day chores.</li>
            <li>Good to have a kit for  starting out doing gel nails.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very proud of my job, and my nails don&#x27;t look thick.</li>
            <li>This includes taking off all the old polish, filing the nails to a nice length (they will grow over 2 weeks so</li>

            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>not only did I have to use my reading glasses I had to use a really good magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>I purchased this starter kit thinking the bottles were full size, however they are not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just upgraded to the full size kit.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper here than regular stores, so for beginners i think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the mini sizes are a fraction of the price of the full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>If I had wanted to wait a full week for this item I would have ordered the non-prime eligible item at a lower $$.</li>
            <li>Works well and should last a good Amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good product, just takes practice, I have only used once.  </li>
            <li>I went out and got the full size products.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the full size bottles of Gelish instead.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a good amount of time and would probably last even longer if I didn&#x27;t like to change my polish as often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is like a miracle to me, this is what I fantasized about as a teenager, some kind of indestructible polish that stayed fresh and new looking forever.</li>
            <li>love how easy it was to do this and how professional my nails look.  </li>
            <li>A more economical replacement is just buying a bottle of pure acetone.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells a great little LED light for around $80-90</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than other brands I’ve tried and is a great price.</li>
            <li>, it was my first attemp to do gel nail on my own, not perfect, but it am one very happy girl.</li>
            <li>For the starter who wants to see if they like to do this at home this is a wonderful little set.</li>
            <li>but once you put on the final coat and then clean it off it is beautiful and looks very professional.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Pair it with cotton balls and foil and that saves money for the removal process because Gelish and other Shellac brands have developed their own removal kits that I&#x27;m sure are nice, but who has money for all the extras these days?</li>
            <li>My nails are long, beautiful, strong and natural.</li>
            <li>but mine quickly lifted from the sides of my nail.</li>
            <li>I never knew why my nails lifted at the tips so quickly.</li>

            <li>tip-I will make my money back for this kit and the light within 3 times of doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>super size for travel .</li>
            <li>However, a quick internet search</li>
            <li>incase you need to make quick fixes before curing.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend : )</li>
            <li>Works very good, very surprised how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>good product-thought the bottles would be a little bigger, but was happy to get started with doing my gel - nails at home.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply the coats very thin to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>I first bought a 32w UV light to use with this instead of the 9w that was sold by the place I got the Gelish set from.</li>
            <li>My first attempt, with the lower wattage 9v UV light, created some problems with bubbling and lifting.  </li>
            <li>Universal success across many brands with one light--NO MORE ISSUES.</li>
            <li>The cured top gel layer makes a great sealant on nail art, and it will last and last.</li>
            <li>The free edge starts to wear first, and then the polish can lift and peel.</li>
            <li>So much more cost effective than going to get my nails done every other week.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>First set I got when I bought my light</li>
            <li>It felt very hot.</li>
            <li>the For the very first time I can do my nails without them falling off in under a week.  </li>
            <li>I do not omit any steps) and put it under the UV light, if burns for the first 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>used it the first time with my 54 watt royal nail uv light machine...</li>
            <li>have to admit, my nails do not look quite as fantastic as they do when I come out of the salon, but darned close...especially for a first try.  </li>
            <li>have tried other products I liked better.</li>
            <li>Even though the bottles are small in the starter kit, it&#x27;s good to have all the pieces when first learning how to do your own gel nails, makes it easier to follow all the steps.</li>
            <li>I tried this polish and loved how it looked and how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>this was so long, I just wanted to give everyone all the info I have learned on the gel kits, so that you can make a good decision on your purchase of gel nails, and a kit, ect, and</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit, a thermal spa light, some lint free wipes and a couple of colors here on Amazon; the whole thing cost me right around $100</li>
            <li>After a week, I applied 1 new layer of top coat and cured it.</li>
            <li>Feel the product is old...have purchased new kit from beauty supply store --works much better.  </li>
            <li>I new to gel polish and found that I love Gelish.</li>
            <li>It was nothing short of amazing, everyone&#x27;s dream come true if you are into nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect kit which looks like it will last long.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why my nails are so much stronger and have such a nice glossy coat for two weeks!</li>
            <li>A quick Google search will provide useful info on how to apply.</li>
            <li>So fast, so easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>and you will have an awesome shiny long lasting manicure.  </li>
            <li>I found limited instructions on the internet and the product is good</li>
            <li>One of the most IMPORTANT things to remember when applying which helps avoid the lifting and peeling is that each coat covers from right above the cuticle bed to the very TIP TOP of the nail.</li>
            <li>I found that a bright color emphasized the &#x60;hump&#x27; area, but the lighter colors made the acrylic and real nail appear pretty seamless.</li>
            <li>I found that a bright color emphasized the &#x60;hump&#x27; area, but the lighter colors made the acrylic and real nail appear pretty seamless.</li>
            <li>small, but good to start with!</li>
            <li>Love Gelish so far!</li>
            <li>if you get used to that, though, it&#x27;s great to have a manicure last so long, and be able to use your hands IMMEDIATELY after doing your nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first gel kit and have not regretted it since!</li>
            <li>, that was actually my first, since it came with the uv lamp, YOU WILL ALSO NEED A UV NAIL LAMP!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>and I am still using my first set (10 months!)</li>
            <li>You need professional grade 100% acetone from either wal mart or Sally&#x27;s but don&#x27;t worry; it&#x27;s a very cheap purchase.</li>
            <li>and this was a great little starter kit.</li>
            <li>Luckily the vendor I purchased it from sent me a new, full sized bottle!</li>
            <li>, does not chip, stays well and looks amazing, and totally shiny</li>
            <li>it would have probably been better for me if I would have went with a different starter kit, probably one that came with an LED light as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money I promise.  </li>
            <li>Regular nail glue on top of cured top coat will still hold them just like regular polish top coat, if you want to try that.&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>

            <li>My Acrylics were gorgeous pink and Whites - but - I was done paying 45 Dollars a month.</li>
            <li>This product is so worth raving about.</li>
            <li>well worth it if I don&#x27;t have to redo my nails every 5 days.</li>
            <li>Follow the steps and viola, and actually i did a pretty good job for doing it the first time.</li>
            <li>are the basic steps to doing your own manicure:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>it’s absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>It’s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>: Set aside a big block of time to do it, rushing through will not give you the nice finished product you want.</li>
            <li>Thin layers are best.</li>

            <li>Thin layers are best.</li>
            <li>I did purchase the clear Structure Gel also to help strengthen my nails and let me tell you it sure works.  </li>
            <li>However, it is well worth spending the time to do the manicure correctly.  </li>
            <li>With one at home manicure I have already gotten my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I recently stopped and have struggled with my nails looking nice.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and thus far, its good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth it for the DIY girly girl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Years ago, in the early 90&#x27;s, I bought some type of clear gel product and UV Lamp at a state fair.</li>
            <li>Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them.</li>
            <li>Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>After getting my nails done twice at the salon, I did however, get tired of paying $25 bucks a pop for my awesome nails.  </li>
            <li>and I ONLY do my own manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to do my own nails because I couldn&#x27;t rationalize paying $45</li>
            <li>My husband and daughter laugh at me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty true to color.  </li>
            <li>So, please be sure to use the remover near color-safe areas.</li>
            <li>it always came out nice and lasted for 2 weeks, maybe it can last longer but with me it doesnt because im always washing my hands.</li>
            <li>But this kit was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I did return this as I am not coordinated enough to do my own nails however my friend did for me</li>
            <li>This is so exciting</li>
            <li>I rarely gush about a product.  </li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t wow me like this one.  </li>
            <li>Although salons around here only charge $35, I decided to try to do my own gel polish and save a bit of money.  </li>
            <li>Never ever thought I would be able to give myself a professional looking manicure but Gelish has changed that for me.</li>
            <li>The extra&#x27;s are nice</li>
            <li>The extra&#x27;s are nice</li>
            <li>Also, each bottle is clearly identified with it&#x27;s purpose so doing gel nails is pretty easy!</li>
            <li>I bought the 36 watt dryer for under $30, followed the timing guidelines on the back of the Gelish Basix Kit, and have amazing nails right now.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, the first time I used to much product and it will \\&quot;pool\\&quot; around the cuticle when under the UV.  </li>
            <li>*Red Carpet, Progel NEVERARPET MANICURE Gel polish with all the Gelish steps (just subbing the Red Carpet color for the Gelish color) with great success!</li>
            <li>the smile line right)</li>
            <li>ususally use two coats of foundation.. use a brush to clean up my smile line with white Gelish 2 times, then hit it with a coat of Top</li>
            <li>Remove old polish and use the cleanser w/ a lint free pad to clean off the nail.</li>
            <li>If you use any of the bright colors, you can probably get about 2 weeks or so before you either get edge wear or noticeable gap in color from the cuticle due to growth.</li>
            <li>I can tell my nails will look even better after doing this a few times, but they look amazing even after my first try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this is the best way to get opaque color to the very ends of my nails, especially when they are long, and it has dramatically increased edge wear on my darker colors.</li>

            <li>but once you get it right</li>
            <li>and I just need to find the right color gel</li>

            <li>Gelish is right.  </li>
            <li>or it doesn&#x27;t turn out right.</li>
            <li>wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li>so we had to do some research to find the right technic.  </li>
            <li>This set all together paid for itself with 3 uses as I believe I paid right around $100 for everything.  </li>
            <li>If you use it right the Foundation lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I always have an issue painting my right hand because I&#x27;m a righty</li>
            <li>If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is easy.  </li>
            <li>you can pretty much make the acrylic nails invisible with this method, or something light.</li>

            <li>Your beautiful nails should last several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Gelish kit does make your nails look beautiful compared to just using regular nail polish, however it&#x27;s not quit the same as a nail salon gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and it will definitely pay for itself after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>The products are easy to use, and directions are very clear.</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated by the size of the bottles but trust me, you can get a ton of manicures out of this amazing set!</li>
            <li>I decided to invest in the system and bought the Gelish system, ordered a LED light (which I highly recommend) and went to town.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty opaque and worth buying if you find them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are pretty opaque and worth buying ifyou find them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottles are small, as described, but a great starter kit for people like me that had no idea what I needed to start polishing my nails with shellac/gel</li>
            <li>I think it is better to start with this small kit to make sure you like it before you buy the full size bottles.</li>
            <li>I just use regular polish, even the cheap stuff, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>But as I expand my collection and try new other gel brands, I have come to realize that the ph bonder in this kit isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>When used properly, this stuff is very high quality and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>and it certainly was!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After removing the old polish, everything else was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a great buy if you are just starting.</li>
            <li>I initially bought a UV light that fit both hands for about $50, I used it for over 2 years.</li>
            <li>we were easily able to shape the smile for the french tips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Frankly, the whole gel process looks like it would be a lot easier to do at home than the more old school acrylics, wraps, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my OWN glass nail file (not some crap that&#x27;s been used on every nail in town) and its flawless.</li>
            <li>Everything you need is labeled and the instructions are quick and fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even look like I had anything on my nails and they feel natural and strong.</li>
            <li>Great size for personal use, my manicure stays on for always more than a week usually 2.</li>
            <li>The written ones are pretty clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this bought a bunch of the polish colors but within a couple days the free edge started to peel up on my right hand every single finger!</li>
            <li>first, I thought it took more time than instructed under the light to cure polish (and other layers).</li>
            <li>One key to making the manicure last is getting a good coat on the free edge of the nail, and that wasn&#x27;t easy with my first couple of times because my nails were short.</li>
            <li>I loved this little set for starting to do gel nails at home :) thanks!</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and brand new (still in packaging with plastic wrap)!</li>
            <li>This is my first time applying gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this after I had gotten my first Shelac manicure at a salon and the girl had used Gelish color and said the two brands work together.</li>
            <li>My first manicure lasted about a week</li>
            <li>After eight weeks I finally peeled more off, you&#x27;ll probably need to soak it with acetone to remove it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m getting such pretty results with better products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m getting such pretty results with better products.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s some of the most opaque polish I&#x27;ve ever found, especially pinks</li>
            <li>No, but in only doing my nails three times with this system, I have gotten many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I purchased colors from eBay (the same Gellish brand) and I love those as well.  </li>
            <li>but I am back to buy more polishes.</li>
            <li>The only two items you need from this kit are the foundation and the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I just received my gelish mini basix kit from Amazon and did my first DIY gel polish.</li>
            <li>My French manicure lasted 3 weeks and could have lasted even more...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get a bigger uv lamp and more colors..</li>
            <li>B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] to start doing it at home.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and my manicure</li>
            <li>: be aware the bottles are mini, not the full-sized.  </li>
            <li>I just did my first gel manicure at home and it looks like I paid for a manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did look up a tutorial on YouTube to be sure I used to product correctly because the directions (if you could call them that) on the box aren&#x27;t specific.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I don&#x27;t have to do each nail individually!  </li>
            <li>I got this kit today and tried it out (using the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer, and It&#x27;s a Lilly gelish polish).</li>
            <li>I took pictures of my first couple and they look pretty horrid.</li>
            <li>I am into the third week of just foundation and top coat.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to do my nails because most of the reviews I read stated that this manicure will last up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li>Although I was hesitant to spend so much money on nail polish and also have to buy a UV lamp to cure the Gelish, I did it anyway thinking that if this product works, it will be well worth it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I did my nails</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake I made at first by not reading the reviews of the colors.  </li>
            <li>I bought these with USpicy Macaron UUSND-3603 Professional UV Acrylic Gel light.  </li>
            <li>i love the gelish system and in fact i only use gelish for my manicures.</li>
            <li>With proper nail prep, I have been able to go a week with no chipping.</li>
            <li>The top it off is probably polyurethane but not sure, top it off works well,but the brush needs soaked in acetone to get the hardened stuff off.  </li>
            <li>so it really needs directions!</li>
            <li>For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li>do more than one coat if necessary.</li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are interested in at home gel nails.</li>
            <li>If you run out of last step top cure liquid you can use rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is so much better and easier and quicker than regular polish.</li>
            <li>The cuticle oil isn&#x27;t a must-have either, so once you use it it&#x27;s really not necessary to buy more unless you just like using it.</li>
            <li>B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING</li>
            <li>I have found that the OPI set comes in a larger amount and works better.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before deciding and found this item on Amazon priced much better than local retailers, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>This really should have been shipped in a box instead of an envelope!</li>
            <li>You would be better off buying bigger bottles of the starter kit.</li>
            <li>We followed this with the top coat (included in the kit) and left it under the lamp for 180 secs.  </li>
            <li>Take your time with the first coat and get it exactly how you want it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a starter kit, my first time using shellac nail polish.</li>

            <li>I was able to figure out the proper order online by watching some YouTube videos and will share with you below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:</li>
            <li>so many others, the 8.5x11 bubble mailer for the kit was damaged (a 3 inch tear in the middle), yet the kit itself was intact, though a bit squished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just did my nails, (only using the Gelish PH Bond, Foundation, Top It Off)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it and not each and every bottle individually.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the gel nails I get done at the salon, but the process seemed simply enough for me to try to do it at home.</li>
            <li>Purchasing from here really saved me some money!</li>
            <li>B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]].</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t order the kit again, but I LOVE the product, I am totally hooked on Gelish!</li>
            <li>Pays for itself the first application.  </li>
            <li>And, even if I end up buying 10 more bottles of color and rebuy some of the basic products I figure I&#x27;ll be saving about $1000 a year</li>
            <li>I would suggest Bashful first so that you can practice with it and that way</li>
            <li>, I have experience with another product similar and was able to use it.  </li>
            <li>posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am definitely going to recommed this product to my friends and am doing my mom&#x27;s nails tomorrow :)</li>
            <li>The first time I had gel nails done I went to the salon and they used gelish</li>
            <li>I have been using the foundation, regular polish, then the top it off.</li>
            <li>My first try didn&#x27;t go well.  </li>
            <li>second try, went better.  </li>
            <li>Mine lasted almost exactly a year</li>
            <li>It was my first Gel anything.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and it came out exactly like in the salon.</li>
            <li>Go get it fast!</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t remove it correctly the first time</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a gel nail system</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Therefore when the kit omitted the Top it off bottle of polish used to set the final step of gel polish on my nails was not included, the polish remained tacky.</li>
            <li>Stop paying so much money at the salon and invest in the home kit!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had this applied several times and love the product.</li>
            <li>Though the basic kit doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, I was easily able to find a YouTube video and followed along.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately no instructions came with kit</li>
            <li>With the purchase of this, the polish and the UV light, I figured it would only take 2-3x (depending on where I have them done) of preparing my own nails to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>The top coat and foundation are the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>Apply the Top Coat the same way as the Foundation in step 4, including wiping it off after curing.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>I have used the professional light</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can do my nails and the polish last for about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I will only be purchasing the MUST which I feel are the Foundation and the Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I will only be purchasing the MUST which I feel are the Foundation and the Top Coat.</li>
            <li>my right hand comes out very neat and pretty</li>
            <li>I usually do not wear a color, and wearing the top it off coat as clear is pretty.</li>
            <li>It also made my nails very brittle and one just peeled and tore right off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reviewing other comments, I decided to try it on my own.  </li>
            <li>The other ladies bring their own baggie of orange-sticks.</li>
            <li>You can take a buffer or light board and gently sand this ridge down, and do another stripe of top coat if you want to.</li>
            <li>Voila, no weak soggy breaking nails!</li>
            <li>Voila, no weak soggy breaking nails!</li>
            <li>(I spent only $50 on mine, worked great) and this Gelish Basix kit.</li>
            <li>First time doing shellac/gel nails myself, pretty easy to understand, wish the bottles were larger though.</li>
            <li>It would be easier to apply a nice thin even coat with better quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kit locally, for $20 more than Amazon wants for it.</li>
            <li>(same brand my tech was using) for such a good price, I jumped on it.  </li>
            <li>Good present for parents to give to teen age girls.</li>
            <li>The remover is good but had to buy a larger quantity for future removal of gel polish.</li>
            <li>I work in retail and am very hard on my nails and am excited to have something so easy to use and to be able to now do it myself.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>I also think that using a light color until I get used to the process was a really good idea (a big thanks to one of the previous reviewers for this tip).  </li>
            <li>The pH bond I have yet to use, the Nourishment is nice not a must but more of an everyday treatment for your cuticles, the nail polish remover I have tons of from my local dollar store.</li>
            <li>The pH bond I have yet to use, the Nourishment is nice not a must but more of an everyday treatment for your cuticles, the nail polish remover I have tons of from my local dollar store.</li>
            <li>I was really ticked off at first (because I didn&#x27;t read specifics when I bought it,</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, you need more than just this kit to do your nails; but it&#x27;s an economical way to get started.  </li>
            <li>Although I love the way it looks and how long it lasts, I truly can&#x27;t stand the fumes from this product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with how long my nails have grown.</li>
            <li>I can have pretty nails on a budget that will look fresh for more than a few days which is important to this busy mom.</li>
            <li>Good way to invest small amount and get what you need.</li>
            <li>Chip free, High Gloss, Dries completely after curing it under UV light&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to use and low maintenance.</li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that at first so ended up doubling my time under the uv light before I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li>I have done at least 4 different gel manicures so far and there is still plenty of the nail polish for many many more.</li>
            <li>You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li>The product is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but you have to wait for it to dry before putting the top coat on.  </li>
            <li>Nail Dryer Professional Finish Quick Dry+&lt;br</li>
            <li>plus, you can do this anytime at home, watching tv or whatever, its convient, easy, low mantience, and cheaper!</li>
            <li>Removal was easy too following instructions found on YouTube.</li>
            <li>If you do white tips, get STRONG ones.</li>
            <li>pa Pure Acetone Remover</li>
            <li>They are just acetone and pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Certainly, I don&#x27;t think that gel is as damaging as acrylics, but it&#x27;s not harmless.</li>
            <li>because im doing the gel nails or not, or if it is a certain product im using, or a certain brand</li>
            <li>For once my nails do not break at a certain length.</li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need to get started, minus the light and actual colored polish, and the product itself is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>however, looking back i should have listened to the reviewers and only bought the full size foundation and top coat and the colors i wanted.</li>
            <li>So far this kit has done a great job, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as in the salon, but it might be me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that cannot for the life of me keep regular polish on my nails for more than a day or two without it chipping badly, so to no one&#x27;s surprise, my discovery of gel nail polish was nothing short of earth shattering to me.  </li>
            <li>Once the color starts lifting up and catching your hair at the cuticle edge, that&#x27;s usually enough to drive you nuts enough to remove it (or buff it down lightly and put on a new top</li>
            <li>This is a lot less than the USpicy light that I used, and I wish now I&#x27;d just gotten the Gelish light to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Just love it, so easy to use, stays at least two weeks and still looks like just painted.</li>
            <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kit, but that&#x27;s fine for personal use (just replace the items that you run out of when the time comes).  </li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I received this kit as a gift and was kind of afraid to give it a try, I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li>I asked the Sally&#x27;s attendant for Gossip Girl (a nice dark pink color) and she gave me Good Gossip (red glittery color)....</li>
            <li>I plan to post another review after that, however, initially wanted to comment on how quick this shipping was!</li>
            <li>This is a nice little set!&lt;br</li>
            <li>No guarding the polish til it gets fully hard, it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>and she loved it and could hardly wait to use it.</li>
            <li>Awesome little starter kit--- while these bottles are smaller they seem to be lasting!  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviews - it&#x27;s easy to use and the results are better than regular manicures.</li>
            <li>I had initially bought the 9 watt gelish mini light and it is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>One of the reviews said to look for instruction videos on YouTube, so I did and that really helped.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll need a LED or fluorescent lamp light for it to cure properly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you could damage your nails if you peel something that isn&#x27;t ready to let go</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t saw back and forth, stroke it from cuticle to nail tip, lightly.</li>
            <li>But make sure you carefully cover your nail surfaces with it.</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t happen very often to you</li>
            <li>don;t really do colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for what you really want to know - how does it work?</li>
            <li>This is a real started kit  </li>
            <li>I really like Gelish products.</li>
            <li>Purchased the smaller kit because thought would stay &#x27;fresh&#x27; better than the larger sizes.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li>If I run out of the products at about the same rate, I&#x27;ll probably just order another set because it&#x27;s so much more economical than buying individually.   </li>
            <li>However, between coats, your nails are tacky and a real fuzz magnet.</li>
            <li>I already had a one bulb UV light that I can carefully put both hands in at the same time, but I&#x27;ve been going three minutes just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I may spring for an LED light in the future just to save some time.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use it and order from this seller who is very prompt.</li>
            <li>Compared to traditional polish, this was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need everything in the kit:</li>
            <li>It makes the removal so much faster.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experimented around with these products much.</li>
            <li>I used  to always get it pooled in the creases between my skin because I put too much on.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a Gelish LED light for about $200.</li>
            <li>At $30 a piece, which is a very conservative estimate, that’s $1,560 in manicures.</li>
            <li>This is one part of the whole process that it took me awhile to appreciate.</li>
            <li>I do this by painting a nail, when I’m done with that nail my brush doesn’t have much polish on it.</li>
            <li>I run it along the edge, since it doesn’t have much polish</li>
            <li>I find it much easier now that I do one hand at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do recommend LED though, for health reasons and because it’s so much faster.</li>

            <li>the gel polish remover works fast when you have to take it off..</li>
            <li>The beauty industry seems to really gouge the prices. .</li>
            <li>The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>I had a UV light at the final destination.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>did work very well.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived it was more pink.</li>
            <li>I now use a 54 watt by Royal Nails and it really ties this whole kit together.</li>
            <li>Just wish I would have received the whole set.</li>
            <li>I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works really well for a starter kit.</li>
            <li>It bled a great deal and stung worse...</li>
            <li>I also really want \\&quot;clear\\&quot; nails</li>
            <li>I recommend a very absorbent cotton, like the type used in disposable powder puffs.  </li>
            <li>and she really likes it</li>
            <li>That tells you how much you’re getting.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really like this starter kit.</li>
            <li>The gel nail remover does go quite fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying from the store</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I left it under the light for over 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I watched several uTube videos to get comfortable with the process since no instructions were included in my box nor a CD.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So, I got her this kit and a relatively inexpensive light for Christmas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She loves them, this came fast and she is very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I had my REAL nails.</li>
            <li>Removal was a trip because I tried to do the whole cotton ball soaked in Acetone and then foil wrapped around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole set up cost about 40$, much cheaper then at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It lasts about 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was fast and it was just like they said&lt;</li>
            <li>I got this set and it could have been great but some of my bottles were broken.  </li>
            <li>as described - thanks</li>
            <li>the kit was shipped fast, packaged well.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>but hey I&#x27;m saving money this way haha</li>
            <li>I managed but next time I will use a lint free cloth to prevent getting cotton in my polish and stuck on my nail</li>
            <li>I will purchase cuticle oil elsewhere but still not to happy about me paying for something, and have it be broken when I receive it.</li>
            <li>The ingrediants on the bottles let me know that I don&#x27;t really need all of these things when I start replacing them.</li>
            <li>It will be very tacky and sticky once cured.</li>
            <li>and it was really work the money.</li>
            <li>BUT it seems so much easier to paint the nails with Gel Polishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will agree with others I don&#x27;t think this whole kit is a must UNLESS you are a newbie to the Gel Polish mani.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will agree with others I don&#x27;t think this whole kit is a must UNLESS you are a newbie to the Gel Polish mani.</li>
            <li>Most sites selling UV lamps professionally say you need to change them every &#x27;several years&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The best way to guarantee that your polish job will lift and peel off, is to not do thin layers, and to let this get outside of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;*Make</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this starter kit for anyone just starting to do their own Gelish nails.</li>
            <li>Make sure the Top Coat can stick to the nail so be sure to leave a smidge of the nature nail exposed by the cuticle as well so it can stick to the nature nail which would prevent lifting and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each coat of polish, Foundation, Color, Color and finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat should be THIN.</li>
            <li>the only issue I have is the price for the amount of product, it IS clearly in the description that this is a MINI kit, but it does have everything that I NEED (except the UV light), I wanted the kit for the first time I did gelish, as with many of the other reviews say, you can get more product for cheaper, but I wanted to KNOW that I did everything just right, so I was fine with paying a little higher price for the amount gotten, I am totally sold on Gelish!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to using regular polish, this is not much different-you&#x27;ll be able to figure it out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Just do thin coats of Foundation and Top Coat and make sure to clean and prep your nails prior to doing this.</li>
            <li>If you do, it is easy to peel off and doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to do at home and cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I have nails that are long, strong and flexible.</li>
            <li>you do the top coat, again one long stroke each time, and make sure to wrap it around the ends a little.</li>
            <li>Little tip if you get fine glitter and mix it with a little top coat you can do French manicures that look amazing.</li>
            <li>As I applied the product the first time, I was a little panicky because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not the surface should be sticky between layers.  </li>
            <li>(Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li>(Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li>(Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li>So I must tell you, I LOVE Harmony Gelish due to the fact that it lasted on my fingernails around 12 days with no chipping, peeling or nail breakage.  </li>
            <li>We had other  co-workers at break time getting their nails done and there is still more product to use.  </li>
            <li>not every nail but enough to re-do them just after 2-3 days after applying original coats.</li>
            <li>It was amazing how it was dry and ready to go minutes after the last coat.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>Gels are much different, and easier, and barely any detectable odor with the Foundation and Top It</li>
            <li>Great kit for someone just starting and not sure about gel soak off polish.  </li>
            <li>* Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend using a tiny brush to clean excess polish off skin before curing.</li>
            <li>first attempt lasted 11 days and would of lasted a few more</li>
            <li>what I like about it is that I can grow my own nails long because the gel hardens them enough to withstand all the dishwashing and house cleaning and lotion applying.</li>
            <li>This is great for me because I rarely have time to sit still long enough for my nails to truly dry completely</li>
            <li>Others have gone into detail about how you can save money on some of the items, but the base coat and top coats are still a good buy - especially if you aren&#x27;t sure you want to do this.  </li>
            <li>however, I will probably only use it for special occasions and when I am going on vacation.</li>
            <li>: I have since found the UV light to be a less economical purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the time to do a gel manicure on yourself and if you use a very light color you can go a long, long time without any noticeable dings!</li>
            <li>if you mess up then you don&#x27;t have a bright red nail polish mistake.</li>
            <li>The pamphlet inside gives pretty clear instructions and there was an instructional dvd in the box as well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised once you do all the layers, how even the whole thing looks!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised once you do all the layers, how even the whole thing looks!</li>
            <li>you get full sized polishes and smaller cleanser and polish remover to help you get started with your gel polish manicure.</li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>cool thing is that you can put regular polish on over the Gelish (one coat is plenty) and take it off with the non-acetone remover with no effect whatsoever on the Gelish.  </li>
            <li>My significant other bought me an LED light for Christmas that only takes 45 seconds to cure plus a cute pink gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>No bad fumes and nails last longer</li>
            <li>The thing I really love is that - my nails aren&#x27;t being filed down shorter than I like.</li>
            <li>Although I do love my Gelish light, there are smaller, cheaper ones out there if you’re not sure you want spend that much upfront.</li>
            <li>Although I do love my Gelish light, there are smaller, cheaper ones out there if you’re not sure you want spend that much upfront.</li>
            <li>( I have reviews or will as soon as im done writing all of them, for all of these items), and there is gems and other things that you can get to jazz your nails up, which scared me at first because I thought it would be hard, but its actually pretty easy, and no I did not spend a fortune to get all the items I have, since most everything is just a couple dollars, and I have picked stuff up here</li>
            <li>I chose this because i&#x27;m new to the whole &amp;#34;diy&amp;#34; nails.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t walk around with slightly smudged or dinged pedicures :)</li>
            <li>It could just be some that ended up outside your nail bed (but I already told you not to let that happen!), but it is also likely there is a side that didn&#x27;t get all the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>
            <li>It is frustrating when you can see light through your nail tips, or see strokes of color as the light shines through!</li>

            <li>8-22-12: While I like that Red Carpet&#x27;s gel colors work with the Gelish kit, I have decided to not recommend Red Carpet any more.</li>
            <li>For darker colors, and for 3rd layers, try 30 base/60 1-2 coats/90 3rd coat/90 top coat</li>
            <li>This is only a mini kit, but more than enough to get you started.  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing so I will be able to do a French Manicure when I do my nails next.  </li>
            <li>I have used the artificial nail remover so far and it has worked great!</li>
            <li>but even after watching the dvd and following the explict instructions.it doesnt last more than 2-3 days before literally peeling off of my nail.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get double the product, better price, and possibly a shade that you can&#x27;t just go buy!</li>
            <li>They are the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; bottles, so you will get a decent amount but for the price you can by the .5 ml bottles.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering the regular size foundation and top coat next week!</li>
            <li>I got lucky and found a clearance color at Sally&#x27;s for $10, but it was still a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>The Gel Polish is thicker and spreads, it&#x27;s not like regular polish where if you don&#x27;t have enough and need to get more for a coating.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought there should be something out there that I could simply coat my natural nails with to allow them to grow out long and strong, but a traditional manicure never lasted more than a day, ditto on wraps, hardeners, etc.</li>
            <li>My final recommendation is to use lint free or fuzz free wipes, otherwise you will be dealing with fuzzies stuck in your polish which is no fun.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Gelish Structure,which is pretty much the same thing as the Foundation but its much thicker.</li>
            <li>A little time consuming the first time, but once you know all the steps, pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>And I will always recommend these awesome products to everyone who wants extra protection to their natural nails or even fake nails</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting an electric nail drill to go along with this.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li>so highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;sorry</li>
            <li>I do wonder how many applications I can get out of these little bottles.  </li>
            <li>Everything is miniaturized and comes in a cute little box.</li>
            <li>I did love the results but was a little bummed it did not include the DVD.</li>
            <li>go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well.</li>
            <li>go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to do just have to be careful around edge of nail!</li>
            <li>and keep in mind, the bottles are large enough that you wont have to replace them all that soon, so the price for the whole kit is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>next you do the top coat, again one long stroke each time, and make sure to wrap it around the ends a little.</li>
            <li>Once you see the steps in action it makes reading through and utilizing the instruction manual much easier.</li>
            <li>The instructions are vague but there is a great video on you tube on how to use this Gelish Kit.</li>
            <li>Practicing on friends or fake nails is a great also.</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m really amazed at how well gelish lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most of the Red Carpet I relegated to toes, where opacity on long nails is not an issue.</li>
            <li>It normally costs me $30 to get my gel set at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have had equal amount of success with this as i have had with shellac (and it is cheaper).  </li>
            <li>I have already orderd a few more colors</li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li>cool thing is, once I have the clear gels set, I can paint my nails with regular (non gel) nail polish.</li>
            <li>I think that these are definitly worth purchasing rather than going and buying them all individually at the beginning.</li>
            <li>to some this is totally worth it considering the mani&#x27;s last for close to three weeks</li>
            <li>After a few rounds yourself, you&#x27;ll learn what you can substitute with non-gelish brands and what you use most.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t hold a seller accountable for shipping delays but I received the shipping notice 6 days after I paid.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time without having to buy the full size products.  </li>
            <li>I normally pay the salon $50 to do my toes and fingers, but with this kit I can do it over and over and save literally a bundle of cash, and my nails look</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who wants nails that last much longer!</li>
            <li>The ph, foundation and top coat work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li>and I have even used normal polishes making the \\&quot;Gelly</li>
            <li>Normal polishes</li>
            <li>Normal polishes</li>
            <li>Also would like a little more liquid material in the new box.</li>
            <li>BUT THE OTHER BOTTLES IN PACKAGE WERE FINE</li>
            <li>I am not going to be returning, because the other items were just fine, it was just the oil.</li>
            <li>I like how easy the Red Carpet goes on, but lasting power?</li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li>I love their base and top coats, and their colors are RICH.</li>
            <li>, everything is tiny, but priced right.</li>
            <li>and I definitley will go back to the salon to get my gel nails done the right way.</li>
            <li>The gel polish fills in the gap between your new nail growth and the acrylic.</li>

            <li>(NEW) BUILDER GEL:</li>
            <li>I treated myself to the new gel polish I&#x27;d been hearing about and had my nails done at the salon before a vacation.</li>
            <li>Brand new just as the description said.</li>
            <li>so I can try a new color.  </li>
            <li>New    </li>
            <li>For starters, I&#x27;d like to mention that a set of gel nails at any salon where I live is $35-$40.</li>
            <li>This stuff works after getting a new bottle of the foundation from Sally B.</li>
            <li>Everything was brand new</li>
            <li>This would have cost $50-$100 at a nail salon since they would have considered this a new gel set.</li>
            <li>process of doing gel nail polish was new to us</li>
            <li>It is brand new.  </li>
            <li>if your new to this, like I was, I hope this is helpful</li>
            <li>If I knew THEN how long-lasting a gel manicure is, I would not have amassed such a huge collection of regular polish!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice but is amazingly easy and you can get the supplies for less than the cost of a fill in at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;*if</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice but is amazingly easy and you can get the supplies for less than the cost of a fill in at the salon.</li>
            <li>I changed my mind about several Gelish polishes I was about to give away because they were so thin that I couldn&#x27;t be happy with the tips, now that is not a problem.</li>
            <li>I changed my mind about several Gelish polishes I was about to give away because they were so thin that I couldn&#x27;t be happy with the tips, now that is not a problem.</li>
            <li>This kit gives you nearly everything you need to get started (minus a light and color).</li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>I love this little kit!</li>
            <li>I find this important more so when using this Gelish system since the gel does dry hard and can irritate cuticle when placed slightly on top of cuticle; and the UV light is a little harsh on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can get less expensive options for most of these and just invest in a large bottle of top coat/foundation with colors.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells many colors for around $12 for regular polish sized colors, whereas Sally&#x27;s sells the tiny bottles for $14!</li>
            <li>kit is very complete.  </li>
            <li>It looks very professional.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the directions and use very little product.  </li>
            <li>Manicures are easy and long lasting without the expense of the salon.  </li>
            <li>I did learn that the topcoat seems to move a bit when curing so next time I will use less and not get it quite so close to my cuticles but other than that it&#x27;s all great.  </li>
            <li>Not able to get this to stay on for more then a week.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you don&#x27;t get it on your skin or cuticles or it will not sure</li>
            <li>you consistently get &#x27;pliable, peely&#x27; color, there are several things to consider.</li>
            <li>My first color was \\&quot;Camera Flash\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not opaque enough for me for fingernails</li>
            <li>So many of their colors are mid to sheer, and with the four layers needed to get even relative opacity, come bubbling and lifting.</li>
            <li>I have given away almost all my Red Carpet colors and find that I reach for Lomasi first now.</li>
            <li>First of all, my kit came (sealed) with an open PH bottle that had emptied into the box.  </li>
            <li>and WOW!</li>
            <li>first one I got &#x27;blew up&#x27; the 2nd time I went to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>On the box they are EXACTLY the same</li>
            <li>So if regular polish starts to chip on you, within the first day or two, your nail chemistry will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stays on well, which is no small feat for my nails.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a small cleanser, which removes the sticky tack off the top it off, and a polish remover sampler.</li>
            <li>Top It Off, etc are small as well (9ml)</li>
            <li>Literally the only other thing I had to buy to get started was my favorite gelish color...</li>
            <li>Even though the bottles are mini they still have enough in them for several uses - more than enough to decide if you like the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is small, but I&#x27;ll be able to get plenty of uses out of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchase this kit here by far!</li>
            <li>all the items in that kit are very small sized, really tiny bottles of everything, but it was worth it for the lamp, which works great, however you can get a cheap lamp on here as well, so that is not really a problem either, and you will want to get a few polish&#x27;s (of any gel brand) as well, so you can change up your color and your nails.</li>
            <li>(for my uv light and a dark color polish it was 3 minutes).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just want to smooth that down.</li>
            <li>use a lint free wipe to wipe down the area with alcohol, to get the dust off.</li>

            <li>I use a lint free wipe to wipe down the area with alcohol, to get the dust off.</li>
            <li>but you can lightly buff the clear off and do a thin color overcoat and another top coat if using the same color.&lt;br /&gt;VOGUE</li>
            <li>but you can lightly buff the clear off and do a thin color overcoat and another top coat if using the same color.</li>
            <li>using the top coat, be aware that it is very thick and tends to clump.</li>
            <li>There are hundreds of how-to videos on not only the basics of the gel manicure, but also special effects like french tips and nail art.</li>
            <li>This is only day two for me and already I am impressed because a typical French manicure using regular polish will only last me a day before it starts chipping off.</li>
            <li>Updated everything, deleted old recommendations and added new products</li>
            <li>If you are the kind of person that don&#x27;t have the time to pack and send items back when you are not satisfied stay away.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same quality as the professional salon product.</li>
            <li>Only buy if you are positive</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip: My nails grow REALLY fast and the first application had too much polish on my cuticles which caused lifting after just a few days.</li>
            <li>The mini bottles last long enough to get you through more 20 manicures in my experience, so</li>
            <li>Poor quality control for sure!</li>
            <li>Ive used the more expensive CND shellac and this is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Place one coat of polish over your nail and the tip of your nail and either let it dry (if using regular nail polish) or use the UV light for 2 minutes for gel polish</li>
            <li>Place a second coat of polish over your nail and the tipand either let it dry or use the UV light for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>The only thing I was a bit diappointed in that the bottles are so super tiny.  </li>
            <li>Right after I did my nails with this, I took a shower and washed my very long hair.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last long like the original Shellac.</li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine had previously bought another brand name kit through a living social special and she was much happier with the results of the gelish kit, and plans on buying one herself now.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say the &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach to applying the product is probably a big key to success.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will probably use the soak off gel wraps and file a little more off.</li>
            <li>I have only done it a couple of times, so I may need to practice a little more.</li>
            <li>It also seems to work so quickly that polish doesn&#x27;t have a chance to spread out like it does in other lamps.</li>
            <li>that is large enough for one whole hand; I didn&#x27;t find the &#x27;portable&#x27; lights (especially those that do 4 fingers!!)</li>
            <li>Everything you need to get started, plus clear instructions.</li>
            <li>This set is clearly for do it yourself at home</li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>The package didn&#x27;t give me clear directions</li>
            <li>One can use just the foundation and the topcoat and have a \\&quot;clear colored\\&quot; nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly.... (sorry for the novel) as for light I use an LED light because it helps speed the cure time up</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had no chipping so far (been on for a week).  </li>
            <li>I just took off my last polish because my nails had grown out too much.  </li>
            <li>but I eventually got to the point that when I clipped my nails to shorten them one day, the acrylic was so far to the tips of my nails that it just broke off.</li>
            <li>but I eventually got to the point that when I clipped my nails to shorten them one day, the acrylic was so far to the tips of my nails that it just broke off.</li>
            <li>simply because my nails will have grown so much.</li>
            <li>Much longer then regular polish (one to three days).</li>
            <li>I bang my nails around all day &amp; they remain unblemished &amp; without chips for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The ph bond and the nourish is extra stuff you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if my product is old.  </li>
            <li>and I got the biggest run around about how Id have to send the whole thing back and wait for a refund</li>
            <li>Walmart sells the same stuff in a much cheaper package.</li>
            <li>I also purchased Need a Tan - even with two coats, the color is considerably lighter than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I am by far-</li>
            <li>I have used it once so far</li>
            <li>Complete kit versus basics:</li>
            <li>Between taking the old nails off and redoing them</li>
            <li>Complete kit versus basics:</li>
            <li>Between taking the old nails off and redoing them</li>
            <li>Very simple to use, and much cheaper than getting your nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li>This product has lasted 4 weeks on my toes so far.  </li>
            <li>As close to professional as it gets.</li>
            <li>Overall prompt and fast service from vendor.</li>
            <li>If you are a trained professional you would be buying a professional set not this.</li>
            <li>but nothing like getting professionally done.  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this product once.</li>
            <li>So far no chips, no peeling, no dents and its been over a week.</li>
            <li>You end up with professional looking nails when you are finished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, in conjunction with a UV light [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So far, looks like I just stepped out of the salon.  </li>
            <li>Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics.</li>
            <li>Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics.</li>
            <li>Two of them are opaque, so I don&#x27;t know how much I have left after doing my nails twice.  </li>
            <li>Contains everything you need to complete a gel manicure-EXCEPT THE COLOR.</li>
            <li>and I nearly completely lost my voice.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it lets you decide if you want to buy the product in larger amounts without spending too much.</li>
            <li>She went from getting gel nails at the salone ($35 and chip after about 3 days), to having her nails look professionally done for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>Products are old.</li>
            <li>This kit had all the tools that my daughter needed to complete her Nail care.  </li>
            <li>The look is professional.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li>It really does last</li>
            <li>In fact, because it&#x27;s self leveling I found it MUCH easier to apply than traditional polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so they looked professional.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the quality of the product</li>
            <li>I just put this on my natural nails, no tips or anything.</li>
            <li>I might not be doing it completely correct</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t find any long helpful reviews when I first started my gel nail search, so I hope this helps somebody out....</li>
            <li>As shiny as the polish is after curing makes your nails look professionally done, even when you suck at polishing techniques.</li>
            <li>The polish was very forgiving and easier to work with than regular polish in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I looked online and saw it on amazon for so much cheaper than what it was sold for in local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Using a block buffer file, buff off the nail&#x27;s natural shine and shape the nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realized that I can do my own nails with a small investment I would save money before long.</li>
            <li>I have found the times listed on each step to be accurate.nd finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t coat it on thick and make sure you stay within the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>I took my time making sure i put the polish on slowly-</li>
            <li>If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>I put the polishes in a bowl of warm water to thin out.  </li>
            <li>when you move the brush up to the top of the nail you MUST cover the very tip, almost as if you are going to paint behind the nail.</li>
            <li>Professional quality - love the $aving as long as I have enough time &amp; patience to slow down enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re mini sizes, it&#x27;s still a great deal because with gel polish manicures, you only need a very thin coating and that in turn means you get a lot of uses out of these mini bottles.</li>
            <li>small size makes it easy to pack .</li>
            <li>The pH bond and the Nourish will last a long time and I will only have to get a restock of the Foundation and The Top Coat sometime in the future.  </li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>sure to take the time to carefully paint down the sides as far as you can, covering the color coat.</li>
            <li>Off sealer appear to be nearly exactly the same ingredients listed in the same order.</li>
            <li>Apply the first thin coat of color gel polish and cure under the light per the box.</li>
            <li>I let the regular polish dry completely before using the top it off (or else it will wrinkle from the heat/still being wet!).</li>
            <li>But overall, I highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li>After doing many sessions and talking to others, I found out that you only really need the base aka &amp;#34;foundation and the top coat aka &amp;#34;top</li>
            <li>My last manicure lasted nearly two weeks, and as hard as I am on my hands, I don&#x27;t forsee it ever going past that, but, as I said, regular polish never lasted more than a day or two, if I didn&#x27;t manage to gunk it up before I ever got the top coat on.</li>
            <li>I originally tried to do a gel manicure myself with a cheap 9 watt lamp, a base coat, a white polish for a french manicure, and then a top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes an hour or so to take off the old Gelish and put on a new coat.  </li>
            <li>I can live with short natural nails.</li>
            <li>The light pink I used really keeps my little errors from being noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The top coat can go on a little thick, so that is something you&#x27;ll want to use sparingly but overall well worth the money!</li>
            <li>others left such positive reviews I will continue to try it out.</li>
            <li>Works ok but probably will go back to the nail salon was not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li>My nails where unbelievably shinny and chip free for two weeks.</li>
            <li>It really lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time; it doesn&#x27;t chip or peel off unless you really try to peel it off.</li>
            <li>I ordered darker colors than I would normally order with the hope that they actually turn out lighter than the color on the computer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>When I redid my nails, I was super careful to put a VERY THIN layer near my cuticles, however, I used the included cuticle oil twice a day and by the end of the week, my nails looked SUPER fresh.  </li>
            <li>but I think that the bulbs are not as effective despite the ridiculous long life claims of the seller I bought them from.</li>
            <li>found it easier to apply starting in the MIDDLE of the nail and working the Polish down and up and side to side, I found this to help me avoid the extra clean up of too much polish on the sides of the nail or gathering by the cuticle&#x27;s which I think gives the \\&quot;mani from home look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Inthe future, I&#x27;ll order in advance from Amazon when I want a new color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you can get the polish separate on here, and there are so many color choices, it seems expensive, but even though you apply a few coats, it still last a really long time, and so does this kit, even though the bottles are a little smaller, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of anything, so it will last a while, and you can buy items separate as needed, instead of buying the whole kit again, if you don&#x27;t need everything, but to get started, this kit is great, since it has everything in it (other than polish, remember to get your polish, you can even use another gel polish if you want, you don&#x27;t have to get the gelish polish, just be sure to get a gel polish, not regular polish, I havnt tried to use a gel kit with regular polish</li>
            <li>Ready for work again and totally dry.</li>
            <li>So the first couple times didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>I have done 4 manicures so far on myself saving a total of $90 so far</li>
            <li>, it did not come with a clipper, they are only a few dollars though, and tips are cheap as well, there are even tips for toe nails on here, along with designed tips and colored tips), so you can get those items and mix it up, along with all kinds of additional tools,</li>
            <li>I love IBD hands-down over any other brand right now for ease of use, fewest number of coats, and the fact it&#x27;s half the price or less of Gelish.</li>
            <li>With regular polish I&#x27;d spend easily an hour on it only to mess it</li>
            <li>bought the Gelish kit when it was on major sale at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li>The word \\&quot;mini\\&quot; does mean mini, so you will only get 2 treatments out of the foundation and top coat.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Gelish or any other comparable item on the market.</li>
            <li>major</li>
            <li>all major plus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This kit has it all and some basic tools .There are Gelish kits for the same price minus all the extras that have full size bottles.</li>
            <li>This kit has it all and some basic tools .There are Gelish kits for the same price minus all the extras that have full size bottles.</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>I followed directions to a T and did very light thin layers.</li>
            <li>I was very careful when first applying (even though I&#x27;ve had this process done at</li>
            <li>At first, I winced at price of kit and UV lamp (36 watt, Salon Supply Store online, $25), but now I can have numerous applications for the price of a single trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews about doing all the steps in this, and they were right.</li>
            <li>Back off on how much you use, it really takes about half of what you think it does.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the package comes pretty fast, undamaged, unopened, as described, with everything listed included, and directions, which are really really simple, it is a little time consuming at first, but not much, and after a couple times, and doesn&#x27;t take that long unless you are doing something fancy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING, anyone that is having issues with this system has to be doing something wrong with applications.</li>
            <li>The important thing to doing it yourself is getting at least a 32 watt lamp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased at least 50% of their available colors and when I want an opaque color, that&#x27;s what I want.</li>
            <li>I have done dishes every night, cleaned two bathrooms and general housekeeping.</li>
            <li>The polish is generally tacky until you finish with the Nail Surface Cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>garden, craft... use my hands a lot in general.</li>
            <li>it just takes longer (keep it under a UV light for at least 2-3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Note, I&#x27;m not advocating PEELING it off, but if you have had it on so long that it&#x27;s ready to give up, that&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li>I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li>I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li>I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li>Removing the old polish took me quiet awhile.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t think I filed the old polish off enough.</li>
            <li>My friend and I have had several applications from one kit so far.  </li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>Complete package with all necessary items need to do my nails.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are nearly the same.  </li>
            <li>I can livewith short natural nails.</li>
            <li>I think I have enough of each left for at least one or two more nail applications</li>
            <li>and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  </li>

            <li>For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  </li>
            <li>This kit is a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; kit so the bottles are small, but it is more than plenty to do a lot of manicures especially since they last longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li>Professional product, the same quality as nail salons.</li>
            <li>I am pretty rough with my hands and for this set to last through what I do day in and out...</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of doing my own nails after having a gel polish manicure in a salon.  </li>
            <li>One suggestion, be sure to apply thin layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just go lighter than heavier with the gel do a thin coat and make sure you coat the ends of your nails just like when you paint them and paint the tips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;7)  Place a thin coat of the Top</li>
            <li>The shop still forced me to pay full price because he \\&quot;fixed it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I did one hand first and after wiping them down with the cleanser, the cotton ball stuck to a nail on the undone hand.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how long the large bottles will last me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think anybody, other than me, will notice them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with other gel-type products (Not Gelish) and they work very well together.  </li>
            <li>I have typed, cleaned my bathroom among other tasks and my nails are holding up really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s is the only place where I live that sells their stuff, and they carry way fewer colors and they only sell the tiny .5 oz bottle, like the size that comes in this kit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t change my polish very often, so the smaller sizes will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>Simple Sheer is their basically clear color coat.</li>
            <li>Getting your gel set up started gets expensive, so this is a nice way to cut that initial cost.</li>
            <li>The key is to make sure all the coats are thin.</li>
            <li>The polish would not dry.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for busy people who hate to wait to get there</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needs step by step instructions and tips like use very dry brush not thick layers</li>
            <li>That is probably fine with bond, foundation, and sealer as a single user might not use enough before the product got old and thick.  </li>
            <li>Most of the gals I know that have their nails done professionally, acrylics, or whatever, come out looking like they have these thick, white-tipped little spatulas growing out of the ends of their fingers.</li>
            <li>This is half the price of Sallys for EXACT same thing !!!</li>
            <li>I used half the tiny bottle in my first use...</li>
            <li>It was very hard to get my skin clean and not mess up the paint.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to get my skin clean and not mess up the paint.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m becoming a pro with each \\&quot;fix\\&quot; to the broken nail.  </li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>Skip the Gelish Acetone as it is exactly the same as regular acetone except they water it down some.  </li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li>and it does last for a couple weeks, without chipping off, so it saves on mantaince, just keep your cuticules oiled and groomed and your hands and nails will look good for at least 2 weeks if not more!</li>
            <li>I have attempted to use this kit twice but the foundation just simply will not dry (even with a nail dryer).</li>
            <li>And also the foundation got really thick really quickly,</li>
            <li>it gets thick quick with all the layers -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an owner of thin nails that tear off constantly and for my 21 years I&#x27;ve NEVER had feminine, long, healthy nails.</li>
            <li>For those who wonder why it drys tacky all I have to say is that you have never gotten your nails professionally done because when a manicurist does a gel set they are always tacky until they are wiped off after the last coat so don&#x27;t expect them to be dry after each cycle.  </li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>I love IBD hands-down over any other brand right now for ease of use, fewest number of coats, and the fact it&#x27;s half the price or less of Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;*Shellac and Lomasi are hardly in my rotation because they are pricier</li>
            <li>The kit had a shrink wrap and appears new, however, I notice other buyers have had the same experience.  </li>
            <li>personal nail chemistry makes it hard for me to keep on even salon applied solar gel nails on for more than a few days.  </li>

            <li> This is a good Starter kit for Shellac.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good started</li>
            <li> I loved the gel polish manicures and I get it done at the salon all the time.  </li>
            <li> I did watch a u-tube video on the process which I also believe made it easier, and also gave some good tips.  </li>
            <li> Some kits have a mini-dvd; good luck with *that* thing.</li>
            <li> I bought an LED light (look around for best price!)</li>
            <li> Just helps make it look good longer</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need the ProBond IBD and IBD Bonder (superior to Gelish)</li>
            <li> It cures flawlessly in the Gelish light.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need the ProBond IBD and IBD Bonder (superior to Gelish)</li>
            <li> It cures flawlessly in the Gelish light.</li>
            <li> I get good results with Lomasi color whether using my Gelish base/top or the Lomasi brand.</li>
            <li> The brushes in the bottles are superior to the dinky Gelish/Red Carpet brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been battling gorgeous nails all my life - and had to resort to acrylics -</li>
            <li> u spicy gel light and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It literally sticks that good.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I got home and polish still looked good but was growing out so needed to come off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit to get started and see if you want to do your own at home shellac mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy that I can have nice looking nails again.</li>
            <li> Now my friends are amazed that my nails I did at home look as good as theirs that they spend a lot of money on.</li>
            <li> Find a good TV show or put on some music.</li>
            <li> Find a good TV show or put on some music.</li>
            <li> Loved the file ti came with too</li>
            <li> It was still a good deal.</li>
            <li> good for a week</li>
            <li> I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li> but I do like it, seems to work good.  </li>
            <li> and I have good eye sight.  </li>
            <li> good bang for the buck..</li>
            <li> But it pays for itself AND it looks as good as if someone certified is doing them.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good.</li>
            <li> Get a good \\&quot;cap\\&quot; on the ends of the nails, even if it gets on the skin of your finger tips- that will peel off without effect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for anyone wanting to start doing their own nails at home</li>
            <li> Worked good</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> But I do think this is a good way to decide if you like a product or not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beginner kit.</li>
            <li> and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  </li>
            <li> While it takes some time, my nails look good for around two weeks.</li>
            <li> Curing Light Timer 36 Watts and the combo was perfect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beginning for your nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brand</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Loved us this product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> They come all in one and good product.</li>
            <li> the good part is you don&#x27;t have to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> it was good</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the beginner gel nail polisher.  </li>
            <li> Good starter kit.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I used a cheap eye liner brush and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li> and I continue to use it time after time and to refill products because they are so good.</li>
            <li> I found some really good instructions and I have had my gel polish on for 3 days now.</li>
            <li> Perfect for replacement for original one</li>
            <li> This is an excellent way to get familiar with the Gelish products, without the upfront investment.  </li>
            <li> Went on vacation for 3 weeks and was able to keep my manicure beautiful.</li>
            <li> This removes the tackiness leaving you with beautiful smooth, sleek, shiny nails!  </li>
            <li> It still looks nice, and will continue doing my own maicures now that I have the resources!  </li>
            <li> They still look perfect through two nights of bartending at my part time and three days of typing at my full time job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a very good product.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick sample, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> , I was really wanting to start doing gel nails myself at home, and by reviews, this was the best kit, and everyone suggested gelish, so that&#x27;s what I went with, and this kit is great</li>
            <li> and/or a polish is the sensational kit, but</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combo and size to try out for the first time the Gelish experience!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the way they turned out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very glad i tried it.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will continue using the gel on my nails, foundation and top just because it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> and I have been very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great kit, cheaper priced than most beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> but I love a great manicure.</li>
            <li> , my nails are very healthy, but when i apply the foundation/base code(mind</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about this product and cannot wait to try it.</li>
            <li> If you are good with polishing and filing your own nails, then this is just o.k.</li>
            <li> I love this product and love the compliments I get on my nails!!</li>
            <li> and everyone is using gel on top of their acrylic nails, so decided to buy here where the price is way better than Sally&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to take care of my own nails, but this kit is great for learning how to do it.</li>
            <li> Also a great place to start to be sure you want to do your own manicures/pedicures.  </li>

            <li> Great system its as easy as painting your nails.  </li>
            <li> this polish is so easy to use &amp; it looks great</li>
            <li> Pure acetone seems to work best.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my manicure and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> the color looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> The amazing thing was how shiny it still was, and I&#x27;m a klutz with my hands, not to mention I wash my hands 10 million times a week, it seems, being in the health care field and I garden, etc.</li>
            <li> I used a UV light with this polish and it worked great.</li>
            <li> This kit is a great way to try it out without a huge commitment.</li>
            <li> This kit is a great way to try it out without a huge commitment.</li>
            <li> I am happy that someone made this polish available for the diy girl.  </li>
            <li> I use a 36W UV light and it works great with the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> The Gelish Nail kit is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for a great product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I save lots of time &amp; money now that I do my own nails.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> nice starter kit.</li>
            <li> Most compliments with \\&quot;Good</li>
            <li> but that has been for my own practice.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I could do my own gel manis at home.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails now and they look nice</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on them.&lt;br /&gt;*Next</li>
            <li> No sense in looking like you bring your own Frito chips to the party.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that if you have had some lifting at the edge, this helps make a nice seal.&lt;br /&gt;*Then</li>
            <li> Honestly I prefer IBD over Gelish for their brush, application, durability, and opacity.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Honestly I prefer IBD over Gelish for their brush, application, durability, and opacity.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have included a colour  in the box as well.</li>
            <li> Just started doing my own gels.</li>
            <li> Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so well</li>
            <li> A number of years ago I went to a salon where they did this kind of gel system.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> Doing your own gel nails has a bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Her manicure has lasted over three weeks and her nails are growing nicely.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I might as well bite them since they don&#x27;t look nice anyway.  </li>
            <li> I am getting used to using it and getting that nice gel polish finish on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have all the products that you need in one kit.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for over a year now</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> I had been going to a nail salon and did not want to pay $30 every 2 weeks to keep my nails looking nice.</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged nicely and I got it before the date I was supposed too which was nice.</li>
            <li> I do have to kind of scrape off the product.  </li>
            <li> had to go on youtube and research on my own to figure out how to and what to use each bottle</li>
            <li> Now that I have my own</li>
            <li> If you can paint your own nails without painting your cuticles and fingers than this is for you.  </li>
            <li> So bottom line if you can paint your own nails then you can do this.  </li>
            <li> handy</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always been a DIY kind of girl</li>
            <li> i bought this to start my own gel nail collection....</li>
            <li> This pack is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already blown up all my facebook friends about doing your own gel polish using this Gelish kit...</li>
            <li> After using my daughter-in-law&#x27;s Gelish Basix Kit and loving the results, I decided to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li> If you can paint your own nails, you can do this.</li>
            <li> I have had Gelish done at the nail salon and liked it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it worked perfect and my nails looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess she liked it...</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you are going to do your own gel nails.</li>
            <li> It has everything I needed to start doing my own gel nails.</li>
            <li> I got this kit because I wanted to give doing my own gel polish a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to attempt doing my own gel nails.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of nail product except polish before.</li>
            <li> The polish came off, after soaking of course, quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those who want to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> Includes all the basics and sets you right on tract to beautiful gel manicure.</li>
            <li> CAN GET THE FULL SIZED KIT INCLUDED WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE MINI GELISH KIT FOR COUPLE MORE BUCKS!!</li>
            <li> It was very easy.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to trying out my Gelish kit, but when I got it in the mail, the envelope itself smelled VERY strongly of acetone.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use all you need to do is stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> Using it at home proved to be very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> I love this and love doing my nails!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll need, in addition to the kit: a UV or LED lamp, lint free nail polish removal pads, a microfine buffer, 70% alcohol would also be good.</li>
            <li> Loved that the bottles were huge.</li>
            <li> , I suggest you purchase your own mini kit and follow the directions precisely!  </li>
            <li> I liked this kit for the most part.</li>
            <li> My friends who had it done had great success...</li>
            <li> Make sure all your supplies are handy, including some paper towels and the sticks to get in the cracks.</li>
            <li> Make sure all your supplies are handy, including some paper towels and the sticks to get in the cracks.</li>
            <li> a good light (uv or led</li>
            <li> Package arrived early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Both are perfect for the professional environment.</li>
            <li> I have never been particularly gifted when it comes to painting my own nails</li>
            <li> The product did exactly what it was supposed to do and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wasn&#x27;t really sure what all I needed to do my own gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> you will probably want to invest in a nail brush set, which I ordered on here, and was really cheap and good quality</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product, just wish the people shipping it did more to protect the items in the package</li>
            <li> , we had to watch a you tube video on which bottle to use first but works good, her nail look good.</li>
            <li> It is SOOO EASY!</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s really easy to do!</li>
            <li> I love gelish nail products and it has everthing except the light to get you off to a good start.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased I ordered a couple more colors and will continue to to my own gel manicures from here on out.</li>
            <li> Super excited to be using this gel kit!!!</li>
            <li> Never having applied gel nails before, and learning how, this product is easy to apply and my customers love it!  </li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow, and I love the results!  </li>
            <li> So happy right now :-)</li>
            <li> First time doing gel nails on myself and this starter kit was great.</li>
            <li> For a first time buyer, this kit is great.</li>
            <li> Made for a great gift, and it worked really well!  </li>
            <li> Gives you a good idea of how this product works for you before you invest in the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> Doing my right hand took quite some time, but now I’ve developed great fine motor control and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re easy to use - on the box it gives instructions on the order in which to apply them and the UV curing times, so I just line them up in that order before I start my manicure and have the box handy for the # of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I did my own gel nails, and they look as good as they did at the salon.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and cost effective for me.</li>
            <li> Great idea for new customers who are trying out the routine of doing their own gel nails.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful and it came super quick, in just two days.</li>
            <li> very good product, durable, and for natural nails.</li>
            <li> I got it like more than 4 months</li>
            <li> Also, the top it off solution brush would continuously need to be wiped off (causing most of the product to end up in the garbage)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> One thing I wondered before buying was how many applications this mini kit would provide...</li>
            <li> the pamphlet inside says 15-20 applications which is an amazing savings (even with the purchase of a uv light) over the cost of a salon application.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it.</li>
            <li> I hope gelish comes out with more polish colors and/or polish color kits.</li>
            <li> but I was able to do the steps and touch it up.   </li>
            <li> but I got way, way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I also use the builder gel (Harmony and IBD) to build my own nails and this light works with those too.</li>
            <li> Put the decal on top of your color, before you put on the top coat and cure.</li>
            <li> By the time you add another two coats of color plus your top coat, you cannot tell there is a heavier layer on your tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how the Shellac applies, how it cures, and how it wears.</li>
            <li> It is compatible with Gelish top and foundation coats.</li>
            <li> The decorative topcoats (unlike Gelish) most often provide the PUNCH you are looking for with one coat.</li>
            <li> and Gelish would share the top spot for application, endurance</li>

            <li> The decorative topcoats (unlike Gelish) most often provide the PUNCH you are looking for with one coat.</li>
            <li> but I think I like the Lomasi brand of color better.</li>
            <li> Lomasi is slightly more costly but the application and wear are top notch.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy more</li>
            <li> I love how the Shellac applies, how it cures, and how it wears.</li>
            <li> Most Shellac colors I have had to cure longer than with Gelish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Gelish and Shellac would share the top spot for application, endurance, some Gelish has opacity problems but just follow my trick for the horizontal tip-painting and see how that works for you</li>
            <li> I had to find something better in this economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In using it myself, I love this system and prefer it over paying $30 a pop in the salon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it since I&#x27;m a novice.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t go for the set I suggest you purchase the foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li> I always love gellish polish and gellish itself.  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on them!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this starter set for helping me learn the process of Gelish nails.  </li>
            <li> When you put on the top coat, cure it, and cleanse your nails, you are done.</li>
            <li> I actually love the product its the customer service that sux...</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, but I love my nails now.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a color separately, a UV lamp as well as gloves without fingertips, but it was all worth it for gorgeous nails.  </li>
            <li> Great service and got it fast.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE GELISH</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 months now and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li> Cotton balls will get fibers on your nails so make sure you get lint-free nail wipes and a 180 grit file to use with this kit.</li>
            <li> but I love the finish it gives.</li>
            <li> I like using a buffer block, it gets in the creases better.</li>
            <li> Again, make sure not to get any on the nail or cuticle, but get as close as you can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply top coat.</li>
            <li> Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li> This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration.</li>
            <li> This will prevent the excess from dripping in the creases, make it cure better and make it look better.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I bit them, peeled them and they weren’t cute at all.</li>

            <li> I bit them, peeled them and they weren’t cute at all.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the company sent this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I am expecting three more colors soon.  </li>
            <li> Gelish needs to do a better job with this.</li>
            <li> love the oil</li>
            <li> Happy with the starter kit and good bargain compared to what local beauty store was charging for it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li> TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li> They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li> Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li> There are a lot more gels on the market now, but this is still one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> It may work better with Gelish nail color.</li>
            <li> enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> there was no way I was able to read them</li>
            <li> I bought this size for my teen and its perfect!</li>
            <li> , many ppl skip the phbond</li>
            <li> I used both on the same set and got perfect results from both.</li>
            <li> I wish this basic kit came with a polish color, but otherwise it works out great!</li>
            <li> takes about an hour to soak off though, but better than CND and not watery at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brand&#x27;s top quality for a fraction of the cost in stores.</li>
            <li> and you will be able to do this at home.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Although box came factory sealed, one of the bottles (top it off) inside</li>
            <li> Top It Off</li>
            <li> Love this product and works just like in the salons.</li>
            <li> to get more colors.</li>
            <li> but I was able to watch a you tube video.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Paint on the Top if Off Sealer  11.</li>
            <li> Cure under lamp for 180 secs to make sure it is well cured.  </li>
            <li> COAT AND TOP COAT</li>
            <li> It is helpful to keep cuticles from drying out and maintain a healthy (and healtly looking) cuticle.  </li>
            <li> More colors (better colors)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Their is a nourish step that makes cuticles feel healthy</li>
            <li> Top It Off (top coat)&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> PH Bond prep is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li> The foundation appears to be a bit thicker than the top coat.</li>
            <li> Nail Surface Cleanse appears to be mostly Isopropyl Alcohol with some Acetone thrown in.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to make sure I use gloves doing dishes and laundry to keep the manicure looking nicer longer.</li>

            <li> One thing to note is that your nails will be tacky after using the top it off coat.</li>

            <li> Love the kit, it has everything I need to do my nails just like a salon.  </li>
            <li> Foundation seems way more gummy and it will take some practice I guess on applying thinner coats?</li>
            <li> but it was more like 2 days</li>
            <li> She was pleased with how the products worked.</li>

            <li> I guess she enjoyed the kit to go with her dryer</li>
            <li> Bought this mostly for doing pedicures.</li>
            <li> Anyway, although the product seems ok it would not cure.</li>
            <li> My problem is more with my tips popping off than the Gelish product</li>
            <li> Buy their $5 membership card to save even more.  </li>

            <li> I love Gelish.</li>
            <li> I love this product and because I saw a review on You Tube</li>
            <li> My sister wanted to try out doing her own gel nails with a UV light.</li>
            <li> However, she didn&#x27;t want to make a huge investment into it until she decided how she liked it.</li>
            <li> Would love to hear what amazon has to say about this.</li>
            <li> (I paid $34.99, the non prime product with free shipping is $29.99) since the 2 day shipping that was promised was not delivered on!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use more colors.</li>
            <li> I already did a better job to do my mom&#x27; snail</li>
            <li> My problem was need better directions, than ones on bottles.  </li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I would like more color choices as well.</li>
            <li> I bought replacements and love the results.</li>
            <li> I need to practice more.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT,</li>
            <li> , NO CHIPPING OR PEALING, LOOKS SO SHINY,  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> everything needed included, however I have ordered more tips on here as well and a clipper</li>
            <li> Best product I bought last year!~</li>
            <li> I capped the free edge and everything!</li>
            <li> Nails were left in excellent condition post removal.</li>
            <li> I will need to get better at the application process, but that will come with practice.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this kit.  </li>
            <li> So so so pleased.  </li>
            <li> ie styrofoam, plastic wrapped around glass-- ANYTHING more than just sending glass bottles in a box that moves around.</li>
            <li> followed those steps to a T and my nails look better than I&#x27;ve ever seen them before.</li>
            <li> Love this kit.</li>
            <li> I love my kit</li>
            <li> but good product honestly all you really need is the top coat</li>
            <li> your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The interesting thing about the gel is how strong it is, how strong it makes your nails (I had to clip my nails to shorten them, they were so break-proof!).</li>
            <li> Still using this original kit after 10 months of doing my own gel nails.  </li>
            <li> been using this as a first timer it works good and love it...</li>
            <li> This was a good deal because it gave you everything you needed to be able to do a gel manicure/pedicure at home without purchasing each item individually at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> A great system if you can afford a decent 36V UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cotton ball method is cheap and very easy.</li>
            <li> lol if you want a high uv shine</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow, the colors are great and the product works really well.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to save money by doing my own nails and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t come off quickly as I thought.  </li>
            <li> No complaints especially because with the light I purchased I am able to have beautiful nails in 15 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> I think it is pretty good brand to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been very easy to do and fun!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it, invest in the kit, some colors, and a dryer and save yourself $30 every three weeks!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this kit!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this item here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> So excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li> My nails look great until new growth gets obnoxious.</li>
            <li> but today I got brave, opened the packages and went to YouTube and watched a couple of videos on how to both take off my existing gel as well as put on a new set.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to follow the directions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and had no problems with removing the gel polish and my natural nails were in great</li>
            <li> They feel like a very durable version of a good quality top coat.</li>
            <li> The product works great and doing my own nails was simple but time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I liked the kit very much and it has lasted and looks just like my nails were done at a salon!  </li>
            <li> I received my kit and polish today, did my own nails for the first time with the gelish gel polish and it turned out perfectly and took no longer than a regular manicure.</li>
            <li> The set was a great deal, the price was right and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I said, this kit is a great kit, and gelish is the most popular brand, and you can also pick up the items at sally&#x27;s if you run out of something they normally have all of it in stock, and you don&#x27;t have time to order on here, and they sell the polish&#x27;s as well, which makes it pretty convinent.</li>
            <li> sure they will be fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine , its more so for a person that has alot of time.</li>
            <li> One more tip--be sure to clean any polish off your skin before curing.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Gelish line and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to take your time and follow all the steps and you will have a chip free manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty good at diy beauty and enjoy it, I can see some people not taking their time or reading the instructions with this.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need more than 2 layers on your nail bed MOST of the time, but the tips are where you need opacity: with this horizontal first-layer method, you can get full color on your tips with no shine-through, and still get by with two coats on your nail bed, which helps stave off bubbling and lifting.</li>

            <li> You will run out of these things before running out of the foundation and top coat, but they&#x27;re cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> At the end, after you have cured the top coat, take a lent free pad soaked in cleanser, and wipe off the tacky residue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really love this products, wished they would make the product that doesn&#x27;t require a UV light</li>
            <li> I then applied the top coat and this time I used the UV light for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Good value and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> , I was really trying to be good wearing gloves to do the dishes</li>
            <li> But still love their rich, quality colors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Other than that, its perfect!!</li>
            <li> I had to buy a replacement at the store, but other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have noticed because if you do not put a lot on your cotton pad then it does not come off as easily</li>
            <li> But it was easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> It was quite easy.  </li>

            <li> Strong for nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the water decals for many reasons (mainly because it wets the gel layer) but you can use them if you have much more patience than I do!</li>
            <li> The nice thing about gel color, is how STICKY it is, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get a decal on without lifting.</li>
            <li> She gets very creative with her nails and it is so much cheaper than taking her to the salon.</li>
            <li> I think Gelish made this kit perfectly for the average person.</li>
            <li> You are much better off buying the full size bottles.  </li>
            <li> but it was my first time preparing my own gel manicure</li>
            <li> , they still looked fine after 3 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I got this product and used it and it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> They look much better than when I do my own nails with normal polish, because you can wipe off the mistakes before curing and</li>
            <li> either one is fine</li>
            <li> Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> which was fine with me.  </li>
            <li> I also experiment around more with designs now since the process is so quick.</li>
            <li> The top coat makes your nail so super shiny.  </li>

            <li> Hey, lucky me!</li>
            <li> Newest Super Mini Cute Portable 6W LED Gel Polish Nail Dryer -- it was about $20 bucks and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very strong, shiny, cure well, and are pretty easy to use-I didn&#x27;t even watch the DVD tutorial, but I will.</li>
            <li> For more experienced, you may want the full size bottles of the specific products you&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I did my first gelish last night on my own and it worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I now know what I need, I&#x27;ll probably buy the items separately next time, but again, I&#x27;m happy with them because the process was easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use.</li>
            <li> The Nail Remover is just acetone for the most part (also available at Walmart/Target for super cheap).  </li>
            <li> Perfect for trying a little sampler.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making an easy user friendly product.</li>
            <li> I have found the times listed on each step to be accurate.</li>
            <li> Includes everything you need to get started EXCEPT the light and color gel</li>
            <li> They break easy and I work out a lot and clean a lot which doesnt help the nails.  </li>
            <li> The Gelish system is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got fantastic results using a 14 watt uv light I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You need a UV light as well, which I also ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> You just need to add a color and a light.</li>
            <li> The product looks really nice on your fingers and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li> THE HASSLE GET THE GELISH LIGHT)</li>
            <li> : Just save yourself the money and buy the Gelish light.  </li>
            <li> but once I got the Gelish light, I stopped having ANY issues whatsoever with any brand.</li>
            <li> Then take the &#x27;nail cleaner&#x27; (or 91% alcohol) product on your lint free cloth and swipe your nails.</li>
            <li> I also have UV light</li>
            <li> (UPDATE: The Gelish light solved every problem I ever</li>
            <li> I find I have to cure them 30 seconds each coat with the Gelish light.</li>
            <li> I find I have to cure them 30 seconds each coat with the Gelish light.</li>
            <li> But I did use LED light for this.</li>
            <li> I have since found that I prefer the dramatically shortened cure time (and longevity of the light) of the LED.</li>
            <li> Two coats, smooth and opaque and they STICK.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton free towel which has worked well.  </li>
            <li> Great starter kit to use the Gelish products and to help decide which products you will continue to use and which products you will supplement with similar items (I.e. rubbing alcohol, acetone).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to not run the products up on the cuticle, as that is another place for it to lift and peel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Basix Kit contains everything (besides the UV lamp, and lint free wipes) that you need to get started at home.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to get gel manicures at $36 every two weeks, so I bought this kit, one light harmony gelish color</li>
            <li> the Thermal Spa uv light</li>
            <li> I bought the U/V light</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit, one Gelish color, and a 48 watt UV light.  </li>
            <li> If the nail is still smooth and shiny it will probably lift early.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li> [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget that you need a gel cure light, not included.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop feeling how smooth my nails are.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all about your preference) is important.</li>
            <li> I used cheap ones and all they did was break off and take the gel polish with it.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of the foundation that came out really clumpy and there was no way to get it to go on nicely.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to cure even with my uv light.</li>
            <li> Then buy your kit, a light and lint free wipes.  </li>
            <li> Used with the 36w UV light.  </li>
            <li> this system...just wish I had a Led light instead of a UV</li>
            <li> However, the \\&quot;Gelish Mini Pro: 45 LED Curing Light\\&quot; (that I purchased through Amazon) did have a booklet with instructions as to using the light and how to apply the gel products.</li>
            <li> Now that I look at it, it appears to be a booklet for another Gelish light: the LED6G battery operated...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming my LED light does come with a booklet too, just not the one packed in my lamp</li>
            <li> It took quite awhile for my nails to grow out smooth again.</li>

            <li> gel color of your choice -- 2 minutes UV light</li>
            <li> Off -- 3 minutes UV light</li>
            <li> Nourish the cuticles and surrounding skin -- no UV light</li>
            <li> I bought a LED light at another place that cures in 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I brught tGelish Basix Kit and a UVA curing light.  </li>
            <li> Used with uv light.</li>
            <li> With this kit, color and a UV light, I can keep my nails up at home for what two trips to the salon would cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to start with the ph balance, which they don&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li> led light from Sally beauty for $55</li>
            <li> It is important to note that these are MINI bottles, which is what it says in the picture.</li>

            <li> Gel nails are definitely the way to go these days and gelish has a great product here.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend getting an LED light, because UV can damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone starting out with gels/shellac.</li>
            <li> Bought this and a UV Light to start my at home</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the UV light I have</li>
            <li> Must be used with an UV light.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Salon Edge 36W UV light machine for $25 and this mini kit.  </li>
            <li> then UV light them for 2 minutes...</li>
            <li> It Off on your nails and tip of your nails and UV light for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;8)  </li>
            <li> You need a LED light and some paper towels in addition to this basix kit.</li>
            <li> but it will cure under a UV light too,</li>
            <li> I applied smoothly and evenly, it cured well, and it worked with UV light.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the gel curing light we bought.  </li>
            <li> Turns out the light we got</li>
            <li> UV Gel Lamp Light</li>
            <li> I bought the light that&#x27;s portable.  </li>
            <li> one get one free sale till the end of June.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I could have read the instructions about how to mix it to remove my existing gel nail polish, I would have had more success.  </li>
            <li> two weeks of chip free shine.</li>
            <li> I then used the UV light on the 2 minute setting.  </li>
            <li> Applied a layer of color, UV light 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Applied another layer of color, UV light 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> so I would suggest a lint free cloth.  </li>
            <li> Cure in the light based on the times on the box (1 minute for my UV light).</li>
            <li> Use a paper towel or a lint free pad and wipe off the excess until it&#x27;s smooth, you will need to apply some pressure but do not touch the surface with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>

            <li> VOGUE PROFESSIONAL (r) Rechargeable Cordless Nail Drill File Acrylics Gels Natural Nails Salon Pedicure Pro is the nail dremel I bought, and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Is it as good as a professional?  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and your nails will stay shiny and beautiful for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty easy, and I think I will get better with time.</li>
            <li> Right now Lomasi is THE brand I love.</li>
            <li> Greater starter kit if you want to see if gel nails are right for you.  </li>
            <li> The outside shipping box was intact but smelled very nice inside, like a musky/minty perfume.  </li>
            <li> i do recommend this product for first timers until you get the hang of the what portions you need for yourself, and if you are great portion control this can last fro many applications</li>
            <li> So frustrating because the color and shine was beautiful but what good is it if i can&#x27;t enjoy a week manicure let alone</li>
            <li> After doing much research, shellac nails are the new and best way to go - gel can do much damage.  </li>
            <li> Use cleaner in lint free wipe to clean nail.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for quick and great service.  </li>
            <li> Using a lint free nail wipe, clean nails with the Nail Surface Cleanse.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Gelish system mainly with ibd gel polishes which they work AMAZING together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried to remove and it was super easy to do at home.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the new LED light I bought, or the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curing them for up to 4 minuntes!  </li>
            <li> I used a Bounty paper towel instead of special lint free wipes and had no problems with lint</li>
            <li> Then the second time I tried it the foundation still worked great, but the top it off got really sticky and gummy.  </li>
            <li> might find the instructions overwhelming at first</li>
            <li> so I was somewhat familiar with the process.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep doing my own nails!</li>
            <li> My first manicure turned out flawless, and I did a French manicure on myself for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very satisfied with the kit.</li>
            <li> When I first used the gelish four weeks ago the nails were just to the top of my finger.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> First time using it, and it okay.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish and this was the first brand I used.</li>
            <li> So excited to use this kit again and again.</li>
            <li> This system promises to deliver that, and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe how shiny the polish stays for so long, it&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want to worry about having your hands in water doing dishes or</li>
            <li> Has everything needed and quality is pretty satisfying.</li>
            <li> Be aware that yes, the layers stay tacky until you put on the top coat.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get used to the technique, but this set is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set and was excited as it was supposed to come with a DVD or instructions.</li>
            <li> I was excited to learn there were options to perform no-chip manicures at home.  </li>
            <li> Unless you already are familiar with the process of applying gels you&#x27;re probably going to have to do this because the kit does not come with instructions.  </li>
            <li> Once I learn how to use the product correctly and not get it on my cuticles, I will be golden!</li>
            <li> was so excited to use this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original bulbs</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous since I needed to use tips with this and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I received the kit yesterday and the first time I used it my nails turned out better than they do in the salon.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just testing it, take my word and get the full size kit because this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a LED light by MelodySusie Violetilac 2013</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this polish set I have used 3 or 4 times</li>
            <li> When I received this from the mail man I was nothing but excited to start my gel nail experience.</li>
            <li> This is the Same one I bought from sallys, for 50 dollars, great price, came Fast!!</li>
            <li> My at-home polishes are just as great as those done in the salon, stay on as long, and don&#x27;t chip!  </li>
            <li> Nails looks great and polish lasts for so long!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product and used it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> It peeled off my nails cleanly and with no damage</li>
            <li> I have had mixed results with crystals and add-ons; sometimes if I set them into the top layer before curing, they will stick nicely for weeks.</li>
            <li> you get color on your wipe when doing the cleansing step on your top coat, this means that not all the nail color was sealed with the top clear coat.</li>
            <li> If you get color on your wipe when doing the cleansing step on your top coat, this means that not all the nail color was sealed with the top clear coat.</li>
            <li> You can use rubbing alcohol to clean nails and purchase any acetone to remove polish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the fact that I can choose whether or not I purchase their own nail polish, or even use something like Essie and it stays on all the same!</li>
            <li> I can do dishes, clean, whatever and</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money to get a nice light!</li>
            <li> It has everything you need, except the light, to give yourself a nice clear manicured nails.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> Using lint-free nail wipes we used the nail surface cleanse (also included in kit) to wipe the nails clean.</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 2 weeks out of my manicures, but I got more than a week each time, which is far better than salon</li>
            <li> but you can clean the nails with peroxide or alcohol that you have laying around the house.</li>
            <li> but you can clean the nails with peroxide or alcohol that you have laying around the house.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and decided to get it based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li> And I used it right away!</li>
            <li> I am a DIY&#x27;er, I do my own toenails with a french and understand that not all people have time of patience for that, but the gelish system is very easy, very fast.  </li>
            <li> There are a few steps but the product&#x27;s consistency makes perfect application super easy, and it&#x27;s very easy to fix mistakes, should you make them, prior to curing the layers.  </li>
            <li> Do a little research before you get started and he results are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> It removed just the white polish very easily!  </li>
            <li> Love this whole kit cause</li>
            <li> thought I was getting full size products)</li>
            <li> I love how absolutely rock-hard and glassy it feels.</li>
            <li> Just helps make it look good longer If you use a sheer color</li>
            <li> I love how absolutely rock-hard and glassy it feels.</li>
            <li> I love how absolutely rock-hard and glassy it feels.</li>
            <li> My natural nails have a nice shape but are so flimsy that they can&#x27;t survive the rigors of my job, hobbies, or day to day chores.</li>
            <li> Good to have a kit for  starting out doing gel nails.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very proud of my job, and my nails don&#x27;t look thick.</li>
            <li> This includes taking off all the old polish, filing the nails to a nice length (they will grow over 2 weeks so</li>
            <li> I used  to not prep my nails good enough and  </li>
            <li> This kit has more products than you absolutely need.</li>

            <li> This kit has more products than you absolutely need.</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> not only did I have to use my reading glasses I had to use a really good magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I purchased this starter kit thinking the bottles were full size, however they are not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to the full size kit.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper here than regular stores, so for beginners i think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the mini sizes are a fraction of the price of the full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted to wait a full week for this item I would have ordered the non-prime eligible item at a lower $$.</li>
            <li> Works well and should last a good Amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good product, just takes practice, I have only used once.  </li>
            <li> I went out and got the full size products.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the full size bottles of Gelish instead.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a good amount of time and would probably last even longer if I didn&#x27;t like to change my polish as often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is like a miracle to me, this is what I fantasized about as a teenager, some kind of indestructible polish that stayed fresh and new looking forever.</li>
            <li> love how easy it was to do this and how professional my nails look.  </li>
            <li> A more economical replacement is just buying a bottle of pure acetone.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells a great little LED light for around $80-90</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than other brands I’ve tried and is a great price.</li>
            <li> , it was my first attemp to do gel nail on my own, not perfect, but it am one very happy girl.</li>
            <li> For the starter who wants to see if they like to do this at home this is a wonderful little set.</li>
            <li> but once you put on the final coat and then clean it off it is beautiful and looks very professional.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Pair it with cotton balls and foil and that saves money for the removal process because Gelish and other Shellac brands have developed their own removal kits that I&#x27;m sure are nice, but who has money for all the extras these days?</li>
            <li> My nails are long, beautiful, strong and natural.</li>
            <li> but mine quickly lifted from the sides of my nail.</li>
            <li> I never knew why my nails lifted at the tips so quickly.</li>
            <li> I never knew why my nails lifted at the tips so quickly.</li>
            <li> tip-I will make my money back for this kit and the light within 3 times of doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> super size for travel .</li>
            <li> However, a quick internet search</li>
            <li> incase you need to make quick fixes before curing.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend : )</li>
            <li> Works very good, very surprised how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> good product-thought the bottles would be a little bigger, but was happy to get started with doing my gel - nails at home.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply the coats very thin to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> I first bought a 32w UV light to use with this instead of the 9w that was sold by the place I got the Gelish set from.</li>
            <li> My first attempt, with the lower wattage 9v UV light, created some problems with bubbling and lifting.  </li>
            <li> Universal success across many brands with one light--NO MORE ISSUES.</li>
            <li> The cured top gel layer makes a great sealant on nail art, and it will last and last.</li>
            <li> The free edge starts to wear first, and then the polish can lift and peel.</li>
            <li> So much more cost effective than going to get my nails done every other week.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> First set I got when I bought my light</li>
            <li> It felt very hot.</li>
            <li> the For the very first time I can do my nails without them falling off in under a week.  </li>
            <li> I do not omit any steps) and put it under the UV light, if burns for the first 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> used it the first time with my 54 watt royal nail uv light machine...</li>
            <li> have to admit, my nails do not look quite as fantastic as they do when I come out of the salon, but darned close...especially for a first try.  </li>
            <li> have tried other products I liked better.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottles are small in the starter kit, it&#x27;s good to have all the pieces when first learning how to do your own gel nails, makes it easier to follow all the steps.</li>
            <li> I tried this polish and loved how it looked and how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> this was so long, I just wanted to give everyone all the info I have learned on the gel kits, so that you can make a good decision on your purchase of gel nails, and a kit, ect, and</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit, a thermal spa light, some lint free wipes and a couple of colors here on Amazon; the whole thing cost me right around $100</li>
            <li> After a week, I applied 1 new layer of top coat and cured it.</li>
            <li> Feel the product is old...have purchased new kit from beauty supply store --works much better.  </li>
            <li> I new to gel polish and found that I love Gelish.</li>
            <li> It was nothing short of amazing, everyone&#x27;s dream come true if you are into nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect kit which looks like it will last long.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s why my nails are so much stronger and have such a nice glossy coat for two weeks!</li>
            <li> A quick Google search will provide useful info on how to apply.</li>
            <li> So fast, so easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> and you will have an awesome shiny long lasting manicure.  </li>
            <li> I found limited instructions on the internet and the product is good</li>
            <li> One of the most IMPORTANT things to remember when applying which helps avoid the lifting and peeling is that each coat covers from right above the cuticle bed to the very TIP TOP of the nail.</li>
            <li> I found that a bright color emphasized the &#x60;hump&#x27; area, but the lighter colors made the acrylic and real nail appear pretty seamless.</li>

            <li> small, but good to start with!</li>
            <li> Love Gelish so far!</li>
            <li> if you get used to that, though, it&#x27;s great to have a manicure last so long, and be able to use your hands IMMEDIATELY after doing your nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first gel kit and have not regretted it since!</li>
            <li> , that was actually my first, since it came with the uv lamp, YOU WILL ALSO NEED A UV NAIL LAMP!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> and I am still using my first set (10 months!)</li>
            <li> You need professional grade 100% acetone from either wal mart or Sally&#x27;s but don&#x27;t worry; it&#x27;s a very cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> and this was a great little starter kit.</li>
            <li> Luckily the vendor I purchased it from sent me a new, full sized bottle!</li>
            <li> , does not chip, stays well and looks amazing, and totally shiny</li>
            <li> it would have probably been better for me if I would have went with a different starter kit, probably one that came with an LED light as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money I promise.  </li>
            <li> Regular nail glue on top of cured top coat will still hold them just like regular polish top coat, if you want to try that.&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li> /&gt;*PROGEL:  deleted this paragraph because they aren&#x27;t worth two cents.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My Acrylics were gorgeous pink and Whites - but - I was done paying 45 Dollars a month.</li>
            <li> This product is so worth raving about.</li>
            <li> well worth it if I don&#x27;t have to redo my nails every 5 days.</li>
            <li> Follow the steps and viola, and actually i did a pretty good job for doing it the first time.</li>
            <li> are the basic steps to doing your own manicure:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> it’s absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> It’s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> : Set aside a big block of time to do it, rushing through will not give you the nice finished product you want.</li>
            <li> Thin layers are best.</li>

            <li> Thin layers are best.</li>
            <li> I did purchase the clear Structure Gel also to help strengthen my nails and let me tell you it sure works.  </li>
            <li> However, it is well worth spending the time to do the manicure correctly.  </li>
            <li> With one at home manicure I have already gotten my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I recently stopped and have struggled with my nails looking nice.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and thus far, its good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth it for the DIY girly girl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago, in the early 90&#x27;s, I bought some type of clear gel product and UV Lamp at a state fair.</li>
            <li> Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them.</li>
            <li> Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> After getting my nails done twice at the salon, I did however, get tired of paying $25 bucks a pop for my awesome nails.  </li>
            <li> and I ONLY do my own manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to do my own nails because I couldn&#x27;t rationalize paying $45</li>
            <li> My husband and daughter laugh at me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty true to color.  </li>
            <li> So, please be sure to use the remover near color-safe areas.</li>
            <li> it always came out nice and lasted for 2 weeks, maybe it can last longer but with me it doesnt because im always washing my hands.</li>
            <li> But this kit was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I did return this as I am not coordinated enough to do my own nails however my friend did for me</li>
            <li> This is so exciting</li>
            <li> I rarely gush about a product.  </li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t wow me like this one.  </li>
            <li> Although salons around here only charge $35, I decided to try to do my own gel polish and save a bit of money.  </li>
            <li> Never ever thought I would be able to give myself a professional looking manicure but Gelish has changed that for me.</li>
            <li> The extra&#x27;s are nice</li>
            <li> The extra&#x27;s are nice</li>
            <li> Also, each bottle is clearly identified with it&#x27;s purpose so doing gel nails is pretty easy!</li>
            <li> I bought the 36 watt dryer for under $30, followed the timing guidelines on the back of the Gelish Basix Kit, and have amazing nails right now.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, the first time I used to much product and it will \\&quot;pool\\&quot; around the cuticle when under the UV.  </li>
            <li> *Red Carpet, Progel NEVERARPET MANICURE Gel polish with all the Gelish steps (just subbing the Red Carpet color for the Gelish color) with great success!</li>
            <li> the smile line right)</li>
            <li> ususally use two coats of foundation.. use a brush to clean up my smile line with white Gelish 2 times, then hit it with a coat of Top</li>
            <li> Remove old polish and use the cleanser w/ a lint free pad to clean off the nail.</li>
            <li> If you use any of the bright colors, you can probably get about 2 weeks or so before you either get edge wear or noticeable gap in color from the cuticle due to growth.</li>
            <li> I can tell my nails will look even better after doing this a few times, but they look amazing even after my first try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this is the best way to get opaque color to the very ends of my nails, especially when they are long, and it has dramatically increased edge wear on my darker colors.</li>

            <li> but once you get it right</li>
            <li> and I just need to find the right color gel</li>

            <li> Gelish is right.  </li>
            <li> or it doesn&#x27;t turn out right.</li>
            <li> wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li> so we had to do some research to find the right technic.  </li>
            <li> This set all together paid for itself with 3 uses as I believe I paid right around $100 for everything.  </li>
            <li> If you use it right the Foundation lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I always have an issue painting my right hand because I&#x27;m a righty</li>
            <li> If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is easy.  </li>
            <li> you can pretty much make the acrylic nails invisible with this method, or something light.</li>
            <li> you can pretty much makethe acrylic nails invisible with this method, or something light.</li>
            <li> Your beautiful nails should last several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Gelish kit does make your nails look beautiful compared to just using regular nail polish, however it&#x27;s not quit the same as a nail salon gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and it will definitely pay for itself after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> The products are easy to use, and directions are very clear.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated by the size of the bottles but trust me, you can get a ton of manicures out of this amazing set!</li>
            <li> I decided to invest in the system and bought the Gelish system, ordered a LED light (which I highly recommend) and went to town.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty opaque and worth buying if you find them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are pretty opaque and worth buying ifyou find them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottles are small, as described, but a great starter kit for people like me that had no idea what I needed to start polishing my nails with shellac/gel</li>
            <li> I think it is better to start with this small kit to make sure you like it before you buy the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I just use regular polish, even the cheap stuff, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> But as I expand my collection and try new other gel brands, I have come to realize that the ph bonder in this kit isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> When used properly, this stuff is very high quality and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> and it certainly was!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing the old polish, everything else was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a great buy if you are just starting.</li>
            <li> I initially bought a UV light that fit both hands for about $50, I used it for over 2 years.</li>
            <li> we were easily able to shape the smile for the french tips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Frankly, the whole gel process looks like it would be a lot easier to do at home than the more old school acrylics, wraps, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my OWN glass nail file (not some crap that&#x27;s been used on every nail in town) and its flawless.</li>
            <li> Everything you need is labeled and the instructions are quick and fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even look like I had anything on my nails and they feel natural and strong.</li>
            <li> Great size for personal use, my manicure stays on for always more than a week usually 2.</li>
            <li> The written ones are pretty clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this bought a bunch of the polish colors but within a couple days the free edge started to peel up on my right hand every single finger!</li>
            <li> first, I thought it took more time than instructed under the light to cure polish (and other layers).</li>
            <li> One key to making the manicure last is getting a good coat on the free edge of the nail, and that wasn&#x27;t easy with my first couple of times because my nails were short.</li>
            <li> I loved this little set for starting to do gel nails at home :) thanks!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and brand new (still in packaging with plastic wrap)!</li>
            <li> This is my first time applying gel polish.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this after I had gotten my first Shelac manicure at a salon and the girl had used Gelish color and said the two brands work together.</li>
            <li> My first manicure lasted about a week</li>
            <li> After eight weeks I finally peeled more off, you&#x27;ll probably need to soak it with acetone to remove it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m getting such pretty results with better products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m getting such pretty results with better products.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s some of the most opaque polish I&#x27;ve ever found, especially pinks</li>
            <li> No, but in only doing my nails three times with this system, I have gotten many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I purchased colors from eBay (the same Gellish brand) and I love those as well.  </li>
            <li> but I am back to buy more polishes.</li>
            <li> The only two items you need from this kit are the foundation and the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I just received my gelish mini basix kit from Amazon and did my first DIY gel polish.</li>
            <li> My French manicure lasted 3 weeks and could have lasted even more...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get a bigger uv lamp and more colors..</li>
            <li> B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] to start doing it at home.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and my manicure</li>
            <li> : be aware the bottles are mini, not the full-sized.  </li>
            <li> I just did my first gel manicure at home and it looks like I paid for a manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did look up a tutorial on YouTube to be sure I used to product correctly because the directions (if you could call them that) on the box aren&#x27;t specific.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I don&#x27;t have to do each nail individually!  </li>
            <li> I got this kit today and tried it out (using the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer, and It&#x27;s a Lilly gelish polish).</li>
            <li> I took pictures of my first couple and they look pretty horrid.</li>
            <li> I am into the third week of just foundation and top coat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to do my nails because most of the reviews I read stated that this manicure will last up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Although I was hesitant to spend so much money on nail polish and also have to buy a UV lamp to cure the Gelish, I did it anyway thinking that if this product works, it will be well worth it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I did my nails</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake I made at first by not reading the reviews of the colors.  </li>
            <li> I bought these with USpicy Macaron UUSND-3603 Professional UV Acrylic Gel light.  </li>
            <li> i love the gelish system and in fact i only use gelish for my manicures.</li>
            <li> With proper nail prep, I have been able to go a week with no chipping.</li>
            <li> The top it off is probably polyurethane but not sure, top it off works well,but the brush needs soaked in acetone to get the hardened stuff off.  </li>
            <li> so it really needs directions!</li>
            <li> For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li> do more than one coat if necessary.</li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are interested in at home gel nails.</li>
            <li> If you run out of last step top cure liquid you can use rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is so much better and easier and quicker than regular polish.</li>
            <li> The cuticle oil isn&#x27;t a must-have either, so once you use it it&#x27;s really not necessary to buy more unless you just like using it.</li>
            <li> B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING</li>
            <li> I have found that the OPI set comes in a larger amount and works better.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding and found this item on Amazon priced much better than local retailers, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> This really should have been shipped in a box instead of an envelope!</li>
            <li> You would be better off buying bigger bottles of the starter kit.</li>
            <li> We followed this with the top coat (included in the kit) and left it under the lamp for 180 secs.  </li>
            <li> Take your time with the first coat and get it exactly how you want it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a starter kit, my first time using shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li> B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] and Gelish Magneto Polish</li>
            <li> First, read A. Crafton&#x27;s review.  </li>
            <li> I was able to figure out the proper order online by watching some YouTube videos and will share with you below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:</li>
            <li> so many others, the 8.5x11 bubble mailer for the kit was damaged (a 3 inch tear in the middle), yet the kit itself was intact, though a bit squished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just did my nails, (only using the Gelish PH Bond, Foundation, Top It Off)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it and not each and every bottle individually.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the gel nails I get done at the salon, but the process seemed simply enough for me to try to do it at home.</li>
            <li> Purchasing from here really saved me some money!</li>
            <li> B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]].</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order the kit again, but I LOVE the product, I am totally hooked on Gelish!</li>
            <li> Pays for itself the first application.  </li>
            <li> And, even if I end up buying 10 more bottles of color and rebuy some of the basic products I figure I&#x27;ll be saving about $1000 a year</li>
            <li> I would suggest Bashful first so that you can practice with it and that way</li>
            <li> , I have experience with another product similar and was able to use it.  </li>
            <li> posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to recommed this product to my friends and am doing my mom&#x27;s nails tomorrow :)</li>
            <li> The first time I had gel nails done I went to the salon and they used gelish</li>
            <li> I have been using the foundation, regular polish, then the top it off.</li>
            <li> My first try didn&#x27;t go well.  </li>
            <li> second try, went better.  </li>
            <li> Mine lasted almost exactly a year</li>
            <li> It was my first Gel anything.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it came out exactly like in the salon.</li>
            <li> Go get it fast!</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t remove it correctly the first time</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a gel nail system</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Therefore when the kit omitted the Top it off bottle of polish used to set the final step of gel polish on my nails was not included, the polish remained tacky.</li>
            <li> Stop paying so much money at the salon and invest in the home kit!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had this applied several times and love the product.</li>
            <li> Though the basic kit doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, I was easily able to find a YouTube video and followed along.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no instructions came with kit</li>
            <li> With the purchase of this, the polish and the UV light, I figured it would only take 2-3x (depending on where I have them done) of preparing my own nails to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> The top coat and foundation are the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> Apply the Top Coat the same way as the Foundation in step 4, including wiping it off after curing.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> I have used the professional light</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can do my nails and the polish last for about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I will only be purchasing the MUST which I feel are the Foundation and the Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I will only be purchasing the MUST which I feel are the Foundation and the Top Coat.</li>
            <li> my right hand comes out very neat and pretty</li>
            <li> I usually do not wear a color, and wearing the top it off coat as clear is pretty.</li>
            <li> It also made my nails very brittle and one just peeled and tore right off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reviewing other comments, I decided to try it on my own.  </li>
            <li> The other ladies bring their own baggie of orange-sticks.</li>
            <li> You can take a buffer or light board and gently sand this ridge down, and do another stripe of top coat if you want to.</li>
            <li> Voila, no weak soggy breaking nails!</li>
            <li> Voila, no weak soggy breaking nails!</li>
            <li> (I spent only $50 on mine, worked great) and this Gelish Basix kit.</li>
            <li> First time doing shellac/gel nails myself, pretty easy to understand, wish the bottles were larger though.</li>
            <li> It would be easier to apply a nice thin even coat with better quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit locally, for $20 more than Amazon wants for it.</li>
            <li> (same brand my tech was using) for such a good price, I jumped on it.  </li>
            <li> Good present for parents to give to teen age girls.</li>
            <li> The remover is good but had to buy a larger quantity for future removal of gel polish.</li>
            <li> I work in retail and am very hard on my nails and am excited to have something so easy to use and to be able to now do it myself.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> I also think that using a light color until I get used to the process was a really good idea (a big thanks to one of the previous reviewers for this tip).  </li>
            <li> The pH bond I have yet to use, the Nourishment is nice not a must but more of an everyday treatment for your cuticles, the nail polish remover I have tons of from my local dollar store.</li>

            <li> I was really ticked off at first (because I didn&#x27;t read specifics when I bought it,</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, you need more than just this kit to do your nails; but it&#x27;s an economical way to get started.  </li>
            <li> Although I love the way it looks and how long it lasts, I truly can&#x27;t stand the fumes from this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how long my nails have grown.</li>
            <li> I can have pretty nails on a budget that will look fresh for more than a few days which is important to this busy mom.</li>
            <li> Good way to invest small amount and get what you need.</li>
            <li> Chip free, High Gloss, Dries completely after curing it under UV light&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to use and low maintenance.</li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that at first so ended up doubling my time under the uv light before I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li> I have done at least 4 different gel manicures so far and there is still plenty of the nail polish for many many more.</li>
            <li> You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li> The product is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but you have to wait for it to dry before putting the top coat on.  </li>
            <li> Nail Dryer Professional Finish Quick Dry+&lt;br</li>
            <li> plus, you can do this anytime at home, watching tv or whatever, its convient, easy, low mantience, and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Removal was easy too following instructions found on YouTube.</li>
            <li> If you do white tips, get STRONG ones.</li>
            <li> pa Pure Acetone Remover</li>
            <li> They are just acetone and pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Certainly, I don&#x27;t think that gel is as damaging as acrylics, but it&#x27;s not harmless.</li>
            <li> because im doing the gel nails or not, or if it is a certain product im using, or a certain brand</li>
            <li> For once my nails do not break at a certain length.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need to get started, minus the light and actual colored polish, and the product itself is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> however, looking back i should have listened to the reviewers and only bought the full size foundation and top coat and the colors i wanted.</li>
            <li> So far this kit has done a great job, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as in the salon, but it might be me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that cannot for the life of me keep regular polish on my nails for more than a day or two without it chipping badly, so to no one&#x27;s surprise, my discovery of gel nail polish was nothing short of earth shattering to me.  </li>
            <li> Once the color starts lifting up and catching your hair at the cuticle edge, that&#x27;s usually enough to drive you nuts enough to remove it (or buff it down lightly and put on a new top</li>
            <li> This is a lot less than the USpicy light that I used, and I wish now I&#x27;d just gotten the Gelish light to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Just love it, so easy to use, stays at least two weeks and still looks like just painted.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kit, but that&#x27;s fine for personal use (just replace the items that you run out of when the time comes).  </li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I received this kit as a gift and was kind of afraid to give it a try, I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li> I asked the Sally&#x27;s attendant for Gossip Girl (a nice dark pink color) and she gave me Good Gossip (red glittery color)....</li>
            <li> I plan to post another review after that, however, initially wanted to comment on how quick this shipping was!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set!&lt;br</li>
            <li> No guarding the polish til it gets fully hard, it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> and she loved it and could hardly wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Awesome little starter kit--- while these bottles are smaller they seem to be lasting!  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews - it&#x27;s easy to use and the results are better than regular manicures.</li>
            <li> I had initially bought the 9 watt gelish mini light and it is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> One of the reviews said to look for instruction videos on YouTube, so I did and that really helped.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll need a LED or fluorescent lamp light for it to cure properly.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you could damage your nails if you peel something that isn&#x27;t ready to let go</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t saw back and forth, stroke it from cuticle to nail tip, lightly.</li>
            <li> But make sure you carefully cover your nail surfaces with it.</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t happen very often to you</li>
            <li> don;t really do colors</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for what you really want to know - how does it work?</li>
            <li> This is a real started kit  </li>
            <li> I really like Gelish products.</li>
            <li> Purchased the smaller kit because thought would stay &#x27;fresh&#x27; better than the larger sizes.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li> If I run out of the products at about the same rate, I&#x27;ll probably just order another set because it&#x27;s so much more economical than buying individually.   </li>
            <li> However, between coats, your nails are tacky and a real fuzz magnet.</li>
            <li> I already had a one bulb UV light that I can carefully put both hands in at the same time, but I&#x27;ve been going three minutes just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I may spring for an LED light in the future just to save some time.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it and order from this seller who is very prompt.</li>
            <li> Compared to traditional polish, this was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need everything in the kit:</li>
            <li> It makes the removal so much faster.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experimented around with these products much.</li>
            <li> I used  to always get it pooled in the creases between my skin because I put too much on.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Gelish LED light for about $200.</li>
            <li> At $30 a piece, which is a very conservative estimate, that’s $1,560 in manicures.</li>
            <li> This is one part of the whole process that it took me awhile to appreciate.</li>
            <li> I do this by painting a nail, when I’m done with that nail my brush doesn’t have much polish on it.</li>
            <li> I run it along the edge, since it doesn’t have much polish</li>
            <li> I find it much easier now that I do one hand at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do recommend LED though, for health reasons and because it’s so much faster.</li>

            <li> the gel polish remover works fast when you have to take it off..</li>
            <li> The beauty industry seems to really gouge the prices. .</li>
            <li> The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> I had a UV light at the final destination.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> did work very well.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived it was more pink.</li>
            <li> I now use a 54 watt by Royal Nails and it really ties this whole kit together.</li>
            <li> Just wish I would have received the whole set.</li>
            <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works really well for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> It bled a great deal and stung worse...</li>
            <li> I also really want \\&quot;clear\\&quot; nails</li>
            <li> I recommend a very absorbent cotton, like the type used in disposable powder puffs.  </li>
            <li> and she really likes it</li>
            <li> That tells you how much you’re getting.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really like this starter kit.</li>
            <li> The gel nail remover does go quite fast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying from the store</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I left it under the light for over 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I watched several uTube videos to get comfortable with the process since no instructions were included in my box nor a CD.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So, I got her this kit and a relatively inexpensive light for Christmas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loves them, this came fast and she is very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I had my REAL nails.</li>
            <li> Removal was a trip because I tried to do the whole cotton ball soaked in Acetone and then foil wrapped around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole set up cost about 40$, much cheaper then at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li> It lasts about 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was fast and it was just like they said&lt;</li>
            <li> I got this set and it could have been great but some of my bottles were broken.  </li>
            <li> as described - thanks</li>
            <li> the kit was shipped fast, packaged well.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> but hey I&#x27;m saving money this way haha</li>
            <li> I managed but next time I will use a lint free cloth to prevent getting cotton in my polish and stuck on my nail</li>
            <li> I will purchase cuticle oil elsewhere but still not to happy about me paying for something, and have it be broken when I receive it.</li>
            <li> The ingrediants on the bottles let me know that I don&#x27;t really need all of these things when I start replacing them.</li>
            <li> It will be very tacky and sticky once cured.</li>
            <li> and it was really work the money.</li>
            <li> BUT it seems so much easier to paint the nails with Gel Polishes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will agree with others I don&#x27;t think this whole kit is a must UNLESS you are a newbie to the Gel Polish mani.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will agree with others I don&#x27;t think this whole kit is a must UNLESS you are a newbie to the Gel Polish mani.</li>
            <li> Most sites selling UV lamps professionally say you need to change them every &#x27;several years&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The best way to guarantee that your polish job will lift and peel off, is to not do thin layers, and to let this get outside of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;*Make</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this starter kit for anyone just starting to do their own Gelish nails.</li>
            <li> Make sure the Top Coat can stick to the nail so be sure to leave a smidge of the nature nail exposed by the cuticle as well so it can stick to the nature nail which would prevent lifting and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each coat of polish, Foundation, Color, Color and finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat should be THIN.</li>
            <li> the only issue I have is the price for the amount of product, it IS clearly in the description that this is a MINI kit, but it does have everything that I NEED (except the UV light), I wanted the kit for the first time I did gelish, as with many of the other reviews say, you can get more product for cheaper, but I wanted to KNOW that I did everything just right, so I was fine with paying a little higher price for the amount gotten, I am totally sold on Gelish!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to using regular polish, this is not much different-you&#x27;ll be able to figure it out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Just do thin coats of Foundation and Top Coat and make sure to clean and prep your nails prior to doing this.</li>
            <li> If you do, it is easy to peel off and doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to do at home and cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I have nails that are long, strong and flexible.</li>
            <li> you do the top coat, again one long stroke each time, and make sure to wrap it around the ends a little.</li>
            <li> Little tip if you get fine glitter and mix it with a little top coat you can do French manicures that look amazing.</li>
            <li> As I applied the product the first time, I was a little panicky because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not the surface should be sticky between layers.  </li>
            <li> (Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li> (Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li> (Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!)</li>
            <li> So I must tell you, I LOVE Harmony Gelish due to the fact that it lasted on my fingernails around 12 days with no chipping, peeling or nail breakage.  </li>
            <li> We had other  co-workers at break time getting their nails done and there is still more product to use.  </li>
            <li> not every nail but enough to re-do them just after 2-3 days after applying original coats.</li>
            <li> It was amazing how it was dry and ready to go minutes after the last coat.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> Gels are much different, and easier, and barely any detectable odor with the Foundation and Top It</li>
            <li> Great kit for someone just starting and not sure about gel soak off polish.  </li>
            <li> * Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend using a tiny brush to clean excess polish off skin before curing.</li>
            <li> first attempt lasted 11 days and would of lasted a few more</li>
            <li> what I like about it is that I can grow my own nails long because the gel hardens them enough to withstand all the dishwashing and house cleaning and lotion applying.</li>
            <li> This is great for me because I rarely have time to sit still long enough for my nails to truly dry completely</li>
            <li> Others have gone into detail about how you can save money on some of the items, but the base coat and top coats are still a good buy - especially if you aren&#x27;t sure you want to do this.  </li>
            <li> however, I will probably only use it for special occasions and when I am going on vacation.</li>
            <li> : I have since found the UV light to be a less economical purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the time to do a gel manicure on yourself and if you use a very light color you can go a long, long time without any noticeable dings!</li>
            <li> if you mess up then you don&#x27;t have a bright red nail polish mistake.</li>
            <li> The pamphlet inside gives pretty clear instructions and there was an instructional dvd in the box as well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised once you do all the layers, how even the whole thing looks!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised once you do all the layers, how even the whole thing looks!</li>
            <li> you get full sized polishes and smaller cleanser and polish remover to help you get started with your gel polish manicure.</li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> cool thing is that you can put regular polish on over the Gelish (one coat is plenty) and take it off with the non-acetone remover with no effect whatsoever on the Gelish.  </li>
            <li> My significant other bought me an LED light for Christmas that only takes 45 seconds to cure plus a cute pink gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> No bad fumes and nails last longer</li>
            <li> The thing I really love is that - my nails aren&#x27;t being filed down shorter than I like.</li>
            <li> Although I do love my Gelish light, there are smaller, cheaper ones out there if you’re not sure you want spend that much upfront.</li>
            <li> Although I do love my Gelish light, there are smaller, cheaper ones out there if you’re not sure you want spend that much upfront.</li>
            <li> ( I have reviews or will as soon as im done writing all of them, for all of these items), and there is gems and other things that you can get to jazz your nails up, which scared me at first because I thought it would be hard, but its actually pretty easy, and no I did not spend a fortune to get all the items I have, since most everything is just a couple dollars, and I have picked stuff up here</li>
            <li> I chose this because i&#x27;m new to the whole &amp;#34;diy&amp;#34; nails.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t walk around with slightly smudged or dinged pedicures :)</li>
            <li> It could just be some that ended up outside your nail bed (but I already told you not to let that happen!), but it is also likely there is a side that didn&#x27;t get all the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>
            <li> It is frustrating when you can see light through your nail tips, or see strokes of color as the light shines through!</li>

            <li> 8-22-12: While I like that Red Carpet&#x27;s gel colors work with the Gelish kit, I have decided to not recommend Red Carpet any more.</li>
            <li> For darker colors, and for 3rd layers, try 30 base/60 1-2 coats/90 3rd coat/90 top coat</li>
            <li> This is only a mini kit, but more than enough to get you started.  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing so I will be able to do a French Manicure when I do my nails next.  </li>
            <li> I have used the artificial nail remover so far and it has worked great!</li>
            <li> but even after watching the dvd and following the explict instructions.it doesnt last more than 2-3 days before literally peeling off of my nail.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get double the product, better price, and possibly a shade that you can&#x27;t just go buy!</li>
            <li> They are the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; bottles, so you will get a decent amount but for the price you can by the .5 ml bottles.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering the regular size foundation and top coat next week!</li>
            <li> I got lucky and found a clearance color at Sally&#x27;s for $10, but it was still a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> The Gel Polish is thicker and spreads, it&#x27;s not like regular polish where if you don&#x27;t have enough and need to get more for a coating.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought there should be something out there that I could simply coat my natural nails with to allow them to grow out long and strong, but a traditional manicure never lasted more than a day, ditto on wraps, hardeners, etc.</li>
            <li> My final recommendation is to use lint free or fuzz free wipes, otherwise you will be dealing with fuzzies stuck in your polish which is no fun.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Gelish Structure,which is pretty much the same thing as the Foundation but its much thicker.</li>
            <li> A little time consuming the first time, but once you know all the steps, pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> And I will always recommend these awesome products to everyone who wants extra protection to their natural nails or even fake nails</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting an electric nail drill to go along with this.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li> so highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;sorry</li>
            <li> I do wonder how many applications I can get out of these little bottles.  </li>
            <li> Everything is miniaturized and comes in a cute little box.</li>
            <li> I did love the results but was a little bummed it did not include the DVD.</li>
            <li> go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well.</li>
            <li> go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well.</li>
            <li> Its so easy to do just have to be careful around edge of nail!</li>
            <li> and keep in mind, the bottles are large enough that you wont have to replace them all that soon, so the price for the whole kit is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> next you do the top coat, again one long stroke each time, and make sure to wrap it around the ends a little.</li>
            <li> Once you see the steps in action it makes reading through and utilizing the instruction manual much easier.</li>
            <li> The instructions are vague but there is a great video on you tube on how to use this Gelish Kit.</li>
            <li> Practicing on friends or fake nails is a great also.</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m really amazed at how well gelish lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most of the Red Carpet I relegated to toes, where opacity on long nails is not an issue.</li>
            <li> It normally costs me $30 to get my gel set at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I have had equal amount of success with this as i have had with shellac (and it is cheaper).  </li>
            <li> I have already orderd a few more colors</li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li> cool thing is, once I have the clear gels set, I can paint my nails with regular (non gel) nail polish.</li>
            <li> I think that these are definitly worth purchasing rather than going and buying them all individually at the beginning.</li>
            <li> to some this is totally worth it considering the mani&#x27;s last for close to three weeks</li>
            <li> After a few rounds yourself, you&#x27;ll learn what you can substitute with non-gelish brands and what you use most.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t hold a seller accountable for shipping delays but I received the shipping notice 6 days after I paid.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time without having to buy the full size products.  </li>
            <li> I normally pay the salon $50 to do my toes and fingers, but with this kit I can do it over and over and save literally a bundle of cash, and my nails look</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who wants nails that last much longer!</li>
            <li> The ph, foundation and top coat work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have even used normal polishes making the \\&quot;Gelly</li>
            <li> Normal polishes</li>
            <li> Normal polishes</li>
            <li> Also would like a little more liquid material in the new box.</li>
            <li> BUT THE OTHER BOTTLES IN PACKAGE WERE FINE</li>
            <li> I am not going to be returning, because the other items were just fine, it was just the oil.</li>
            <li> I like how easy the Red Carpet goes on, but lasting power?</li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li> I love their base and top coats, and their colors are RICH.</li>
            <li> , everything is tiny, but priced right.</li>
            <li> and I definitley will go back to the salon to get my gel nails done the right way.</li>
            <li> The gel polish fills in the gap between your new nail growth and the acrylic.</li>

            <li> (NEW) BUILDER GEL:</li>
            <li> I treated myself to the new gel polish I&#x27;d been hearing about and had my nails done at the salon before a vacation.</li>
            <li> Brand new just as the description said.</li>
            <li> so I can try a new color.  </li>
            <li> New    </li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;d like to mention that a set of gel nails at any salon where I live is $35-$40.</li>
            <li> This stuff works after getting a new bottle of the foundation from Sally B.</li>
            <li> Everything was brand new</li>
            <li> This would have cost $50-$100 at a nail salon since they would have considered this a new gel set.</li>
            <li> process of doing gel nail polish was new to us</li>
            <li> It is brand new.  </li>
            <li> if your new to this, like I was, I hope this is helpful</li>
            <li> If I knew THEN how long-lasting a gel manicure is, I would not have amassed such a huge collection of regular polish!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice but is amazingly easy and you can get the supplies for less than the cost of a fill in at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;*if</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice but is amazingly easy and you can get the supplies for less than the cost of a fill in at the salon.</li>
            <li> I changed my mind about several Gelish polishes I was about to give away because they were so thin that I couldn&#x27;t be happy with the tips, now that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I changed my mind about several Gelish polishes I was about to give away because they were so thin that I couldn&#x27;t be happy with the tips, now that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> This kit gives you nearly everything you need to get started (minus a light and color).</li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit!</li>
            <li> I find this important more so when using this Gelish system since the gel does dry hard and can irritate cuticle when placed slightly on top of cuticle; and the UV light is a little harsh on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get less expensive options for most of these and just invest in a large bottle of top coat/foundation with colors.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells many colors for around $12 for regular polish sized colors, whereas Sally&#x27;s sells the tiny bottles for $14!</li>
            <li> kit is very complete.  </li>
            <li> It looks very professional.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow the directions and use very little product.  </li>
            <li> Manicures are easy and long lasting without the expense of the salon.  </li>
            <li> I did learn that the topcoat seems to move a bit when curing so next time I will use less and not get it quite so close to my cuticles but other than that it&#x27;s all great.  </li>
            <li> Not able to get this to stay on for more then a week.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you don&#x27;t get it on your skin or cuticles or it will not sure</li>
            <li> you consistently get &#x27;pliable, peely&#x27; color, there are several things to consider.</li>
            <li> My first color was \\&quot;Camera Flash\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not opaque enough for me for fingernails</li>
            <li> So many of their colors are mid to sheer, and with the four layers needed to get even relative opacity, come bubbling and lifting.</li>
            <li> I have given away almost all my Red Carpet colors and find that I reach for Lomasi first now.</li>
            <li> First of all, my kit came (sealed) with an open PH bottle that had emptied into the box.  </li>
            <li> and WOW!</li>
            <li> first one I got &#x27;blew up&#x27; the 2nd time I went to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> On the box they are EXACTLY the same</li>
            <li> So if regular polish starts to chip on you, within the first day or two, your nail chemistry will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays on well, which is no small feat for my nails.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a small cleanser, which removes the sticky tack off the top it off, and a polish remover sampler.</li>
            <li> Top It Off, etc are small as well (9ml)</li>
            <li> Literally the only other thing I had to buy to get started was my favorite gelish color...</li>
            <li> Even though the bottles are mini they still have enough in them for several uses - more than enough to decide if you like the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small, but I&#x27;ll be able to get plenty of uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchase this kit here by far!</li>
            <li> all the items in that kit are very small sized, really tiny bottles of everything, but it was worth it for the lamp, which works great, however you can get a cheap lamp on here as well, so that is not really a problem either, and you will want to get a few polish&#x27;s (of any gel brand) as well, so you can change up your color and your nails.</li>
            <li> (for my uv light and a dark color polish it was 3 minutes).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just want to smooth that down.</li>
            <li> use a lint free wipe to wipe down the area with alcohol, to get the dust off.</li>

            <li> I use a lint free wipe to wipe down the area with alcohol, to get the dust off.</li>
            <li> but you can lightly buff the clear off and do a thin color overcoat and another top coat if using the same color.&lt;br /&gt;VOGUE</li>
            <li> but you can lightly buff the clear off and do a thin color overcoat and another top coat if using the same color.</li>
            <li> using the top coat, be aware that it is very thick and tends to clump.</li>
            <li> There are hundreds of how-to videos on not only the basics of the gel manicure, but also special effects like french tips and nail art.</li>
            <li> This is only day two for me and already I am impressed because a typical French manicure using regular polish will only last me a day before it starts chipping off.</li>
            <li> Updated everything, deleted old recommendations and added new products</li>
            <li> If you are the kind of person that don&#x27;t have the time to pack and send items back when you are not satisfied stay away.</li>
            <li> It is the exact same quality as the professional salon product.</li>
            <li> Only buy if you are positive</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip: My nails grow REALLY fast and the first application had too much polish on my cuticles which caused lifting after just a few days.</li>
            <li> The mini bottles last long enough to get you through more 20 manicures in my experience, so</li>
            <li> Poor quality control for sure!</li>
            <li> Ive used the more expensive CND shellac and this is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Place one coat of polish over your nail and the tip of your nail and either let it dry (if using regular nail polish) or use the UV light for 2 minutes for gel polish</li>
            <li> Place a second coat of polish over your nail and the tipand either let it dry or use the UV light for 2 minutes</li>
            <li> The only thing I was a bit diappointed in that the bottles are so super tiny.  </li>
            <li> Right after I did my nails with this, I took a shower and washed my very long hair.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long like the original Shellac.</li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine had previously bought another brand name kit through a living social special and she was much happier with the results of the gelish kit, and plans on buying one herself now.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say the &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach to applying the product is probably a big key to success.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will probably use the soak off gel wraps and file a little more off.</li>
            <li> I have only done it a couple of times, so I may need to practice a little more.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work so quickly that polish doesn&#x27;t have a chance to spread out like it does in other lamps.</li>
            <li> that is large enough for one whole hand; I didn&#x27;t find the &#x27;portable&#x27; lights (especially those that do 4 fingers!!)</li>
            <li> Everything you need to get started, plus clear instructions.</li>
            <li> This set is clearly for do it yourself at home</li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> The package didn&#x27;t give me clear directions</li>
            <li> One can use just the foundation and the topcoat and have a \\&quot;clear colored\\&quot; nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly.... (sorry for the novel) as for light I use an LED light because it helps speed the cure time up</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had no chipping so far (been on for a week).  </li>
            <li> I just took off my last polish because my nails had grown out too much.  </li>
            <li> but I eventually got to the point that when I clipped my nails to shorten them one day, the acrylic was so far to the tips of my nails that it just broke off.</li>
            <li> but I eventually got to the point that when I clipped my nails to shorten them one day, the acrylic was so far to the tips of my nails that it just broke off.</li>
            <li> simply because my nails will have grown so much.</li>
            <li> Much longer then regular polish (one to three days).</li>
            <li> I bang my nails around all day &amp; they remain unblemished &amp; without chips for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The ph bond and the nourish is extra stuff you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if my product is old.  </li>
            <li> and I got the biggest run around about how Id have to send the whole thing back and wait for a refund</li>
            <li> Walmart sells the same stuff in a much cheaper package.</li>
            <li> I also purchased Need a Tan - even with two coats, the color is considerably lighter than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I am by far-</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far</li>
            <li> Complete kit versus basics:</li>
            <li> Between taking the old nails off and redoing them</li>
            <li> Complete kit versus basics:</li>
            <li> Between taking the old nails off and redoing them</li>
            <li> Very simple to use, and much cheaper than getting your nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li> This product has lasted 4 weeks on my toes so far.  </li>
            <li> As close to professional as it gets.</li>
            <li> Overall prompt and fast service from vendor.</li>
            <li> If you are a trained professional you would be buying a professional set not this.</li>
            <li> but nothing like getting professionally done.  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product once.</li>
            <li> So far no chips, no peeling, no dents and its been over a week.</li>
            <li> You end up with professional looking nails when you are finished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, in conjunction with a UV light [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So far, looks like I just stepped out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics.</li>
            <li> Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics.</li>
            <li> Two of them are opaque, so I don&#x27;t know how much I have left after doing my nails twice.  </li>
            <li> Contains everything you need to complete a gel manicure-EXCEPT THE COLOR.</li>
            <li> and I nearly completely lost my voice.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it lets you decide if you want to buy the product in larger amounts without spending too much.</li>
            <li> She went from getting gel nails at the salone ($35 and chip after about 3 days), to having her nails look professionally done for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> Products are old.</li>
            <li> This kit had all the tools that my daughter needed to complete her Nail care.  </li>
            <li> The look is professional.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> It really does last</li>
            <li> In fact, because it&#x27;s self leveling I found it MUCH easier to apply than traditional polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so they looked professional.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I just put this on my natural nails, no tips or anything.</li>
            <li> I might not be doing it completely correct</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t find any long helpful reviews when I first started my gel nail search, so I hope this helps somebody out....</li>
            <li> As shiny as the polish is after curing makes your nails look professionally done, even when you suck at polishing techniques.</li>
            <li> The polish was very forgiving and easier to work with than regular polish in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I looked online and saw it on amazon for so much cheaper than what it was sold for in local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Using a block buffer file, buff off the nail&#x27;s natural shine and shape the nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realized that I can do my own nails with a small investment I would save money before long.</li>
            <li> I have found the times listed on each step to be accurate.nd finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t coat it on thick and make sure you stay within the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I took my time making sure i put the polish on slowly-</li>
            <li> If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> I put the polishes in a bowl of warm water to thin out.  </li>
            <li> when you move the brush up to the top of the nail you MUST cover the very tip, almost as if you are going to paint behind the nail.</li>
            <li> Professional quality - love the $aving as long as I have enough time &amp; patience to slow down enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Even though they&#x27;re mini sizes, it&#x27;s still a great deal because with gel polish manicures, you only need a very thin coating and that in turn means you get a lot of uses out of these mini bottles.</li>
            <li> small size makes it easy to pack .</li>
            <li> The pH bond and the Nourish will last a long time and I will only have to get a restock of the Foundation and The Top Coat sometime in the future.  </li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> sure to take the time to carefully paint down the sides as far as you can, covering the color coat.</li>
            <li> Off sealer appear to be nearly exactly the same ingredients listed in the same order.</li>
            <li> Apply the first thin coat of color gel polish and cure under the light per the box.</li>
            <li> I let the regular polish dry completely before using the top it off (or else it will wrinkle from the heat/still being wet!).</li>
            <li> But overall, I highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li> After doing many sessions and talking to others, I found out that you only really need the base aka &amp;#34;foundation and the top coat aka &amp;#34;top</li>
            <li> My last manicure lasted nearly two weeks, and as hard as I am on my hands, I don&#x27;t forsee it ever going past that, but, as I said, regular polish never lasted more than a day or two, if I didn&#x27;t manage to gunk it up before I ever got the top coat on.</li>
            <li> I originally tried to do a gel manicure myself with a cheap 9 watt lamp, a base coat, a white polish for a french manicure, and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes an hour or so to take off the old Gelish and put on a new coat.  </li>
            <li> I can live with short natural nails.</li>
            <li> The light pink I used really keeps my little errors from being noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The top coat can go on a little thick, so that is something you&#x27;ll want to use sparingly but overall well worth the money!</li>
            <li> others left such positive reviews I will continue to try it out.</li>
            <li> Works ok but probably will go back to the nail salon was not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> My nails where unbelievably shinny and chip free for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It really lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time; it doesn&#x27;t chip or peel off unless you really try to peel it off.</li>
            <li> I ordered darker colors than I would normally order with the hope that they actually turn out lighter than the color on the computer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> When I redid my nails, I was super careful to put a VERY THIN layer near my cuticles, however, I used the included cuticle oil twice a day and by the end of the week, my nails looked SUPER fresh.  </li>
            <li> but I think that the bulbs are not as effective despite the ridiculous long life claims of the seller I bought them from.</li>
            <li> found it easier to apply starting in the MIDDLE of the nail and working the Polish down and up and side to side, I found this to help me avoid the extra clean up of too much polish on the sides of the nail or gathering by the cuticle&#x27;s which I think gives the \\&quot;mani from home look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Inthe future, I&#x27;ll order in advance from Amazon when I want a new color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you can get the polish separate on here, and there are so many color choices, it seems expensive, but even though you apply a few coats, it still last a really long time, and so does this kit, even though the bottles are a little smaller, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of anything, so it will last a while, and you can buy items separate as needed, instead of buying the whole kit again, if you don&#x27;t need everything, but to get started, this kit is great, since it has everything in it (other than polish, remember to get your polish, you can even use another gel polish if you want, you don&#x27;t have to get the gelish polish, just be sure to get a gel polish, not regular polish, I havnt tried to use a gel kit with regular polish</li>
            <li> Ready for work again and totally dry.</li>
            <li> So the first couple times didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I have done 4 manicures so far on myself saving a total of $90 so far</li>
            <li> , it did not come with a clipper, they are only a few dollars though, and tips are cheap as well, there are even tips for toe nails on here, along with designed tips and colored tips), so you can get those items and mix it up, along with all kinds of additional tools,</li>
            <li> I love IBD hands-down over any other brand right now for ease of use, fewest number of coats, and the fact it&#x27;s half the price or less of Gelish.</li>
            <li> With regular polish I&#x27;d spend easily an hour on it only to mess it</li>
            <li> bought the Gelish kit when it was on major sale at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li> The word \\&quot;mini\\&quot; does mean mini, so you will only get 2 treatments out of the foundation and top coat.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Gelish or any other comparable item on the market.</li>
            <li> major</li>
            <li> all major plus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This kit has it all and some basic tools .There are Gelish kits for the same price minus all the extras that have full size bottles.</li>
            <li> This kit has it all and some basic tools .There are Gelish kits for the same price minus all the extras that have full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> I followed directions to a T and did very light thin layers.</li>
            <li> I was very careful when first applying (even though I&#x27;ve had this process done at</li>
            <li> At first, I winced at price of kit and UV lamp (36 watt, Salon Supply Store online, $25), but now I can have numerous applications for the price of a single trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews about doing all the steps in this, and they were right.</li>
            <li> Back off on how much you use, it really takes about half of what you think it does.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the package comes pretty fast, undamaged, unopened, as described, with everything listed included, and directions, which are really really simple, it is a little time consuming at first, but not much, and after a couple times, and doesn&#x27;t take that long unless you are doing something fancy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, anyone that is having issues with this system has to be doing something wrong with applications.</li>
            <li> The important thing to doing it yourself is getting at least a 32 watt lamp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 50% of their available colors and when I want an opaque color, that&#x27;s what I want.</li>
            <li> I have done dishes every night, cleaned two bathrooms and general housekeeping.</li>
            <li> The polish is generally tacky until you finish with the Nail Surface Cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> garden, craft... use my hands a lot in general.</li>
            <li> it just takes longer (keep it under a UV light for at least 2-3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Note, I&#x27;m not advocating PEELING it off, but if you have had it on so long that it&#x27;s ready to give up, that&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li> I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li> I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li> I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly??</li>
            <li> Removing the old polish took me quiet awhile.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t think I filed the old polish off enough.</li>
            <li> My friend and I have had several applications from one kit so far.  </li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> Complete package with all necessary items need to do my nails.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are nearly the same.  </li>
            <li> I can livewith short natural nails.</li>
            <li> I think I have enough of each left for at least one or two more nail applications</li>
            <li> and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  </li>

            <li> This kit is a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; kit so the bottles are small, but it is more than plenty to do a lot of manicures especially since they last longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li> Professional product, the same quality as nail salons.</li>
            <li> I am pretty rough with my hands and for this set to last through what I do day in and out...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of doing my own nails after having a gel polish manicure in a salon.  </li>
            <li> One suggestion, be sure to apply thin layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just go lighter than heavier with the gel do a thin coat and make sure you coat the ends of your nails just like when you paint them and paint the tips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;7)  Place a thin coat of the Top</li>
            <li> The shop still forced me to pay full price because he \\&quot;fixed it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I did one hand first and after wiping them down with the cleanser, the cotton ball stuck to a nail on the undone hand.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine how long the large bottles will last me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think anybody, other than me, will notice them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with other gel-type products (Not Gelish) and they work very well together.  </li>
            <li> I have typed, cleaned my bathroom among other tasks and my nails are holding up really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s is the only place where I live that sells their stuff, and they carry way fewer colors and they only sell the tiny .5 oz bottle, like the size that comes in this kit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t change my polish very often, so the smaller sizes will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Simple Sheer is their basically clear color coat.</li>
            <li> Getting your gel set up started gets expensive, so this is a nice way to cut that initial cost.</li>
            <li> The key is to make sure all the coats are thin.</li>
            <li> The polish would not dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for busy people who hate to wait to get there</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needs step by step instructions and tips like use very dry brush not thick layers</li>
            <li> That is probably fine with bond, foundation, and sealer as a single user might not use enough before the product got old and thick.  </li>
            <li> Most of the gals I know that have their nails done professionally, acrylics, or whatever, come out looking like they have these thick, white-tipped little spatulas growing out of the ends of their fingers.</li>
            <li> This is half the price of Sallys for EXACT same thing !!!</li>
            <li> I used half the tiny bottle in my first use...</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get my skin clean and not mess up the paint.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get my skin clean and not mess up the paint.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m becoming a pro with each \\&quot;fix\\&quot; to the broken nail.  </li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> Skip the Gelish Acetone as it is exactly the same as regular acetone except they water it down some.  </li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li> and it does last for a couple weeks, without chipping off, so it saves on mantaince, just keep your cuticules oiled and groomed and your hands and nails will look good for at least 2 weeks if not more!</li>
            <li> I have attempted to use this kit twice but the foundation just simply will not dry (even with a nail dryer).</li>
            <li> And also the foundation got really thick really quickly,</li>
            <li> it gets thick quick with all the layers -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an owner of thin nails that tear off constantly and for my 21 years I&#x27;ve NEVER had feminine, long, healthy nails.</li>
            <li> For those who wonder why it drys tacky all I have to say is that you have never gotten your nails professionally done because when a manicurist does a gel set they are always tacky until they are wiped off after the last coat so don&#x27;t expect them to be dry after each cycle.  </li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> I love IBD hands-down over any other brand right now for ease of use, fewest number of coats, and the fact it&#x27;s half the price or less of Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;*Shellac and Lomasi are hardly in my rotation because they are pricier</li>
            <li> The kit had a shrink wrap and appears new, however, I notice other buyers have had the same experience.  </li>
            <li> personal nail chemistry makes it hard for me to keep on even salon applied solar gel nails on for more than a few days.  </li>
            <li> after 2 and a half weeks it was still shiny and chip free, i had to soak it off merely because my natural nail grew out quite far!!</li>
            <li> So I tried it on my toes with the same company polish and light it took at least 4 times as long to dry as  it said it would.</li>
            <li> I paint it THINLY on the acrylic nail first, and then I start from the cuticle and paint towards the acrylic nail to cover the new growth area.</li>

            <li> The worst burning I ever experienced was at a salon with Gelish Starburst with UV lamp, I thought it was just the fact that the tech was really putting it on and curing it too long, but this feeling can happen and doesn&#x27;t signify that you are being burned.</li>
            <li> , it comes with everything you need, other than polish, which you don&#x27;t need if you just want clear nails</li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> I even went crazy and did black with a glitter french tip and can&#x27;t believe how good they look.</li>
            <li> My biggest tip is to have manicure sticks to clean excess polish off your skin/around the edges, and apply thin coats.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t grow my nails out long; however, for the first time, I can grow them past my finger tips and they don&#x27;t look like I chew them.</li>
            <li> The only problem for me now is it lasts so long I have to wait to try the next color combo!</li>
            <li> The bottles look small at first, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The base coat is thicker and the top coat leaves a slightly higher shine.</li>
            <li> I Youtubed a few things, didn&#x27;t bother with the DVD and got right down to business.</li>
            <li> Ten years later I taught myself to do do my own acrylic nails after a bad experience; the manicurist I went to ignored what I was telling him</li>
            <li> not sure if maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li> you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second Gelish kit.</li>
            <li> I left my gel on so long that it just peeled off after about six weeks</li>
            <li> I left my gel on so long that it just peeled off after about six weeks</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t have to guess if I&#x27;ve kept my nails in long enough.</li>
            <li> Long lasting,</li>
            <li> that was another reason they weren’t lasting as long as they should.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> that was another reason they weren’t lasting as long as they should.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Keep nail polish remover and a flat brush</li>
            <li> Remover bottle will not last long.</li>
            <li> Even though this is a starter kit, everything will last a long time except maybe for the acetone which can be purchased inexpensively at any store.</li>
            <li> The bottle are really tiny but a lot goes a long way with the gelish.</li>
            <li> This kit IS tiny, but I can see how it would last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> The bottles that are included are the smaller size, but after doing my own and a few friend&#x27;s nails, it&#x27;s obvious that the only product that might need replacing in  the next 6 months is the artificial nail remover.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still pliable after you&#x27;ve carefully applied THIN layers, consider that your light may be the culprit.</li>
            <li> and then I stopped when I had kids because I didn&#x27;t have the time to spend waiting for regular polish to dry</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> Oh and today I found out you can&#x27;t do your nails outside, the suns uv rays dry the brushs out.</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all small bottles, but you don&#x27;t use much each time, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I wear pink and white acrylic and never had a problem keeping it on with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Strong like acrylic, wont damage your nails the way fake nails do.</li>
            <li> and I still had to pay full price and then go home to file them down myself because she had made them so thick</li>
            <li> great product bad customer service !</li>
            <li> You may have to google on the order of the application steps as the instructions were not very clear.  </li>
            <li> and im not sure how well that would turn out, so I suggest getting a gel polish, there a few different ones, opi makes one, sensationals, red carpet, ibd, and quite a few more, these brands also have the other items needed to do gel nails as well....), I do have the sensationall nail kit</li>
            <li> I am a novice to the gel nail polish thing, but I bought the OPI starter kit with the polishes and it was difficult to work with, the polishes will very gooey, the brush was extremely narrow and it was very time consuming to prep the natural nail.  </li>
            <li> Even if just a couple to let the novice know that this is the final step to dry the polish!</li>
            <li> There are no instructions included with the product other than the basic guide on the back of the box.</li>
            <li> Delivery was actually a day earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The bottles are pretty small, but you use such a small amount for each manicure that the tiny bottles will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased with UV gel nail dryer for my nails that are very thin, break  and split easily.</li>
            <li> If you are not completely familiar with this product and completely sold on it, do not purchase . . .</li>
            <li> but, still the whole polish would come off in a hard piece.</li>
            <li> but the products were very sticky and hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> You can find a very limited selection of gelish polishes at your local sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li> but seriously you can&#x27;t mess this up unless you get too close to the cuticle bed or don&#x27;t clean the polish up from side of the nails before it sets.</li>
            <li> It’s hard to do at first, but it’s better to do 3-4 coats of thin polish rather than 2 coats of thick polish.</li>
            <li> It’s hard to do at first, but it’s better to do 3-4 coats of thin polish rather than 2 coats of thick polish.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t survive as long as acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I do both fingers and toes and the kit lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> but that was after a long time.</li>
            <li> This is very sheer, and the photo online appeared to be a frosty pink.</li>
            <li> This is very sheer, and the photo online appeared to be a frosty pink.</li>
            <li> (Since Lomasi is harder to find, I have gone back to Gelish for top/bottom.</li>
            <li> This is very sheer, and the photo online appeared to be a frosty pink.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll have to take the polish off long before I ever get a chip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of this, so my nails are not yet salon quality (there will be a learning curve if your not a professional)  </li>
            <li> I got everything I needed and spent maybe $100 total.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ROUGH on my nails (opening boxes for several hours a day) and my nail polish has stayed in tact.  </li>
            <li> However, upon opening up the package both the pink and blue solutions were exploded all over the box holding them.</li>
            <li> We soak off polish at home since that takes too long for break time.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on as long as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> how long I used it.</li>
            <li> From the box it is obvious it did not drain out during shipping but that I was shipped an empty bottle.  </li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner,easy to use, lasts long on nails.</li>
            <li> Is it old and dried</li>
            <li> The bottles are literally mini and there are no instructions on how to use the polish (i.e. what order and how long to cure each one)</li>
            <li> I can still bend my nail somewhat but not nearly as flexible as before.</li>
            <li> the ph bond was empty and the polish remover was open and leaked in the box.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife a long with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I started doing my nails with gelish long time ago</li>
            <li> Not Guiness Book record long but over my finger</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews on here have said how long it lasts for them.</li>
            <li> that long</li>
            <li> Gelish nail product does last me about 5 days with minimal micro chips; this is a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> i have had mine for over a year and have done LOTS of mani, pedis and just now had to buy a new top an base coat.</li>
            <li> got SIX WEEKS out of my gel manicure with pale or clear polishes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, now, after the third manicure (and about 4 weeks of constant wear), I find that my nails are weaker and less shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lookiing forward to using this for a long, long time!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the colors since I only wear very pale, or clear type polish.</li>
            <li> So out of all the products  you will likely purchase the remover long before any of the other products in this have to be purchased again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it seems a little expensive at first, but this whole system (</li>
            <li> I do sometimes mix the polish&#x27;s and such, I don&#x27;t always stick to using the same brand polish with the same gel kit (base and top coats ect), and havnt had a problem with any of that</li>
            <li> Using non-acetone nail polish remover, with an artist paint brush (we highly recommend a quality paint brush as little hairs can cause issues from other types of brushes--especially those designed for make-up!)</li>
            <li> (I have very thin nails) and quickly wore a hole in the middle of my nail with his Dremel while trying to \\&quot;ruff up\\&quot; my nail.</li>
            <li> Also the remover is such a minimal amount it will be gone in no time!</li>
            <li> i bought the basix kit along with june bride, little princess and sleek white for french manicures.</li>
            <li> I only bought the starter kit and one other polish to get started</li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s never grow due to constant splitting and breaking.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews and still had some mixed feelings but gave it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> and there is no way to send product back due to return policy on returning chemicals.</li>
            <li> noted by some other reviewers, there are no instructions in the Mini Basix Kit, only a description on the box of each product.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, it will get on the sides of your fingers, on the cuticle, past the nail, which can make your manicure not last as long.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like (which has NOTHING to do with the product) is how you have to be VERY careful not to let the gel polish get on the side of your skin.</li>
            <li> Except the part about trimming cuticles, but that&#x27;s because I already have really dry cuticles and prefer them not to be cut.</li>
            <li> Any cuticle oil can nourish your skin, and you should use oil as the process can really dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for layers to dry to put on another layer  3.</li>
            <li> Wash hands and allow to dry fully.</li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I just use my mini size curing lamp to dry mails.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t be dry  until you wipe them off at the end</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as soon as I am done, I have totally dry nails.</li>
            <li> and I always end up messing them up before totally dry.</li>
            <li> Moreover I had to wipe away the polish from my nails since nothing would dry.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 hours trying, it just won&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few extra seconds for a longer color payoff.</li>

            <li> Back then the coolest thing was when they came out with a green or blue color</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands and always find myself coming back to Gelish.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and it barely takes off regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails twice so far and kept the colors on about 2 weeks, but could have left on longer because no chipping at all or color fading (at least with the glitter polish I used).</li>
            <li> Soaking off the old polish, filing, cleaning, takes me a minimum of 30 minutes, base coat, top coat, two coats of polish and curing time between.</li>
            <li> I used it anyway and am certain this is the culprit for several of my nails just popping off the entire color in one piece, like a fake nail.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> small bottles and lots of uses thus far</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>

            <li> : I bought \\&quot;Strawberry Smoothie\\&quot; and at first was annoyed that the bottle did not seem to match the picture.</li>
            <li> Till now my life has been full of nail fail.  </li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> The bonus items weren&#x27;t in the box and the cover of one of the nail polishes was loose and leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> New to Gel nail polish, I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it is to get it OFF when you want to.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> to the review of this kit, there is nothing wrong with it, I really do like it, I only give it 4 stars, as I have with most of the other gel products and kits I have got, because I have noticed that my nails have gotten weaker (I have always had weak nails), since I started do gel nails, and I&#x27;m not sure if its</li>
            <li> This system is highly recommended especially if you&#x27;re tired of paying through the nose at the salon.</li>
            <li> I was a nail bitter for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I do the same thing in the salon of using cotton and foil to wrap my nails and in less than 15 minutes, the gel is off.  </li>
            <li> I do it about every week and a half religiously.</li>
            <li> I do it about every week and a half religiously.</li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> And once I got a woman who could not do my nails properly because they were \\&quot;too petite\\&quot; (not too short, my nails are just small).</li>
            <li> The small quantity is enough for several mani pedis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say that ever after a week and a half her nails still look like they were just done the same day.</li>
            <li> AND the odor is so much less than regular polish.</li>
            <li> but as I&amp;#34;m only one person I get the feeling they will last me quite some time despite their small size.</li>
            <li> The Gelish lamp does feel pretty warm though, it was a little shocking compared to what I was used to.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very diluted and weak...</li>
            <li> Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps, Debra Lynn Black 240/320 Grit Nail File ,  Professional 100/100 grit Nail files zebra file emery board,  Harmony Gelish Vitagel - Strength- green bottle  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about filing too deep.</li>
            <li> Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  </li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand,flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go.</li>
            <li> The very last thing you do is wipe the nail off with a little nail remover/cleaner on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> next time - I&#x27;m putting a little bit of Acetone in a bowl and just soaking the polish off.</li>
            <li> I have done my nails quite a few times already and this little kit goes far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard or professional looking.  </li>
            <li> some people say they don&#x27;t need the oil, but I do use it, it helps keep your cuticales from drying out and such, and again cuts down mantience, plus with this you save all the money of going to the salon to have your nails done!</li>
            <li> : I made the mistake of getting some acrylic nails for a wedding; the guy did a bad job on top of picking tips that make it look like I have Frito Scoops on the ends of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting some acrylic nails for a wedding; the guy did a bad job on top of picking tips that make it look like I have Frito Scoops on the ends of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on fake nails and not on my real nails</li>
            <li> Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The mani does last 2-3 weeks when using all Gel Polish and my \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; mani&#x27;s last at least 2 weeks if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*First, use the nail square buffer to lightly rough the surface of your nails.</li>
            <li> then just lightly, carefully, rough up the nail bed between the cuticle and acrylic nail area.</li>
            <li> And then just lightly, carefully, rough up the nail bed between the cuticle and acrylic nail area.</li>
            <li> The product performed what I expected it to</li>
            <li> I called amazon to tell them to replace just the empty bottle</li>
            <li> Just like the salon (except no tip and no gas money spent).</li>
            <li> THE PROBLEM I HAD, WAS THE PH BOND WAS EMPTY WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I have to say about Harmony Gelish is that the colors that I have bought so far as MUCH lighter than pictured in the advertisement or all together wrong.  </li>
            <li> and my kit is not even close to being empty.</li>
            <li> Rough up nails</li>
            <li> I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet ..</li>
            <li> just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> The item&#x27;s product box was crushed on one side.  </li>
            <li> It took longer to receive it than expected.</li>
            <li> Only holds up for a few days and then it begins to peel.</li>
            <li> I went and purchased a bottle of the missing item at a local Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> cure under lamp for 120 sec.</li>
            <li> Cure 120 sec.</li>
            <li> Cure under lamp for 120 sec.</li>
            <li> It has everything we need to get started minus the gel polish in the color of our choice and the UV machine to cure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> For the last few of these years I&#x27;ve been going to a place that does &#x27;gelicures&#x27; and uses Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> I bought the mini in December and used it every 2 weeks for myself and to do my sister&#x27;s nails a few times and still have some left at the start of April.</li>
            <li> Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still wet even after UVing them 4 minutes...</li>
            <li> It looks like a regular manicure on natural nails, and doesn&#x27;t feel so thick and heavy like acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;Plus,</li>
            <li> but when I opened it, one of the bottles was completely empty.</li>
            <li> No real damage to existing nail.  </li>
            <li> (If you use a cotton ball or something linty, it will show up later on your dried nail).</li>
            <li> I got a gelish at my local salon, and they did a horrible job with the application, but I loved the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I would save your money and just get two regular sized bottles of the base and top coats (instead of the mini ones that come with this set).  </li>
            <li> base coat and top coat are what I would consider the only required products in the set.  </li>
            <li> We really liked the fact that the base coat (princess) went on first-then under the lamp for 120 secs.</li>
            <li> The products are about half the size of a bottle of nail polish but you use so little that it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> the bottles are small, but it does last a long time!</li>
            <li> get six weeks out of the pale, sheer colors; by the time six weeks have gone by, my nails have grown and there are dings and chinks in the color here and there</li>
            <li> I also have to wash my hands alot and usually polish does not last very long before it is peeling and chipping off.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using the ProGel as the base, any color pretty much pops off as a whole piece, leaving whatever nail (at least 2 per manicure within days) to look like I had put on press on nails.</li>
            <li> (Once it&#x27;s dry, the thick, hard coat can be peeled off, basically breaking the secure, hard gel.)</li>
            <li> Five seconds for your base coat, 20 seconds color coat (regular colors) or 30 seconds dark colors, and 20 to 30 seconds for top coat.</li>
            <li> *EDITED TO ADD: I wasn&#x27;t being careful to not expose the bottle to the UV lamp while it was on; I have purchased a new bottle of polish since and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the hard lumps.</li>
            <li> Gelish applies extremely easy and I took the advice of other reviewers and applied very thin!</li>
            <li> The items were not held down in the package, and were loose in the box that they came in.</li>
            <li> just a touch more than what 2 manicures would cost me if you factor in the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products arrived, at first I was a bit shocked by the size of the bottles in this kit, they seem very small but after using them I realize that although they&#x27;re small these bottles will probably last me at least a dozen manicures.  </li>
            <li> A little polish goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only instructions were on the bottles which are small since this is an introductory kit, but the print was so small and light, I was unable to read the labels even using a magnifying glass.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting these tiny hard lumps within the gel, they aren&#x27;t clearly visible until I cure them under the lamp, so it&#x27;s hard for me to scrape them off before I \\&quot;set</li>
            <li> I found a bottle of my Gelish base coat that was over a year old, was very thick and kind of gloppy.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The Gelish Basix Kit (although small bottles) is plenty to do several manicures with.</li>
            <li> I have short small nails too</li>
            <li> I made other cheaper lights work</li>
            <li> but they have other colors.</li>
            <li> I listened to the other reviewers in that I did not use cotton balls to finish off the nails -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfectionist, so I&#x27;ve always had problems with other people doing my nails...</li>
            <li> Small enough just for trying the product.</li>
            <li> you have endless chances to do it over because you can remove your mistake with non acetone polish remover ( use a brush to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li> despite the small bottles, it is going to last for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> This kit works well with other Gel nail polish products.</li>
            <li> We can apply the process on each other in case we smudge a bit.</li>
            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> Have any experience with any other type yet</li>
            <li> Regular polish is a thing of the past for me.</li>
            <li> (If someone is helping you, while one hand was under the lamp, the other hand can be painted.  </li>
            <li> Also they will definitely last a while even though they are small, except maybe the polish remover.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, but it still seems to last a while.</li>
            <li> Use a cotton ball or small cut paper towel to use the blue liquid Nail Surface Cleanse over each nail&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> again, the only reason for the four star is because im not sure if this is what made my nails weaker or not, if/</li>
            <li> do recommend this item, and the seller, since I didn&#x27;t have any issues with any of theproducts being opened, or shipping/packaging issues, ect, like I have with another seller of gel kits (see my other reviews....)</li>
            <li> Having two kids in FT childcare requires me to make cuts and spa services didn&#x27;t make the top of the keep list :(  </li>
            <li> The bottles are small but don&#x27;t let the size scare you, you will definitely get TONS of mani&#x27;s from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you got the person who thinks acrylic nails should be an inch thick, then go ahead and lay that barrel parallel to the nail surface and work some of that extra thick acrylic down too, in back and forth motions.</li>

            <li> as well I purchased the gelish soak off gel structure, it is like a base that is made to strengthen your nails, and you can use it with the gel kits or alone, and it comes in clear and pink, and you can use it with acrylics as well, so it is multi purpose, and I normally use it when I do my nails, no matter how im doing them, with or without gel, and with or without polish, it seems to help a lot, I have wrote a review on it as well since I got it on here, and ibd makes the same product as well...</li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I accepted the package from the postman only to open it and find one of the bottles had broken and glass was shattered everywhere.</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> Other times, I look down one day and there is a hole where the crystal/item was.</li>
            <li> Every other nail polish (even ones that stated they last at least a week)</li>
            <li> Just need a little practice with the application and the amount of polish (a little does go a long way).</li>
            <li> and it came with one polish as well, and the other needed items, base and top coat,ect.</li>
            <li> The foundation solution formed little empty circles on my nails, about 3 or 4 little empty circles on each nail</li>
            <li> Be careful to tighten the lids well though, if you don’t they tend to leak a little.</li>
            <li> The foundation and top it off gels are very thick and hard to manage to apply a thin coat.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*Lomasi is now second runner up because it&#x27;s hard to find and pricey.</li>
            <li> It was hard to apply and it last for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Need a Tan is similar to Caucasian flesh tone and Bashful is a very pale pink with very slight sparkles.  </li>
            <li> File the nail down slightly and repeat on the other hand.  </li>
            <li> Not worth all the work.</li>
            <li> you first get this kit, don&#x27;t be shocked at how tiny everything is.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> The only complaint is there were no instructions and</li>
            <li> Tried it out one more time, what a disappointment, am sending the kit and the UV LAMP back, the burning sensation continued, my nail tech advised something must be wrong with the gel application kit or UV Lamp or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> Not sure why it took that long to ship.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how long this type of gel polish lasts.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is in regards to the packaging.</li>
            <li> Apply a thin coat of the foundation, which is a gooey clear polish.</li>
            <li> They are compatible with Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> They are compatible with Gelish base and top coat.</li>
            <li> So at the end of the day if I had to rank all these products in order of preference, with QUALITY and ease of use being the factors (not price): *IBD and Gelish would share the top spot for application, endurance, some Gelish has opacity problems but just follow my trick for the horizontal tip-painting and see how that works for you.</li>
            <li> My nails feel more like I have acrylic nails on, which I like as I hate having breakage on my nails</li>
            <li> Try 30 seconds base, 60 each color, 60 top coat.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come with any colors, just the PH bond, base coat, and top it off.</li>
            <li> I use it after base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> The Foundation base and the Top</li>
            <li> The rubbing alcohol gets off the stick top cot and cleans the nail before applying the base coat.</li>
            <li> It the coats are too thick it will not cure (set) properly.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my skin sting (because you leave it on to soak for 20-ish minutes), but because I was clumsy with all those silly tin-foils tips on my finger, I knocked the bottle over, and it ruined (like, really ruined) the finish on my night table.</li>
            <li> I have crumby nails that split, so I keep them covered in just base &amp; top coat</li>
            <li> Gel Polish goes on THIN and each coat must be cured COMPLETELY before applying another coat.</li>
            <li> you use it, avoid letting it get on your cuticles or running down the sides of your nails.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll hold it at an angle and just take that &#x27;hump&#x27; of acrylic on that edge, down to where it&#x27;s NOT to the nail but not still...hump-y.</li>
            <li> While you are at it, you might run the barrel attachment down the sides, you know how sometimes you get lifting edges down there too?</li>

            <li> Comes with instructional DVD that breaks down everything.</li>

            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight pink tint, but once it&#x27;s on your nail</li>
            <li> about a week and a half before they start to chip or peel.  </li>
            <li> If you plan on leaving the polish on for 2 weeks, go slightly shorter since they will grow quite a</li>
            <li> Another tip is go beyond the end of the nail as the polish shrinks slightly and can leave the tip of the nail</li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> I have never seen one for less.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t compare prices, but my guess is that you can buy at a drug store for less.</li>
            <li> but on the Amazon product info they vary slightly.  </li>

            <li> One less thing to fuss with.</li>
            <li> Just go to any drugs store and buy some for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Takes less than an hour, lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses and this same kit was $49.99 and on Amazon it was 47 % less expensive for the same kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used store bought gel polishes before and usually later in the day or by the next morning they are already chipping or having those weird looking cracks in them.</li>
            <li> This package is half the price of what I would have paid at a beauty store.</li>
            <li> the price is half of what it costs at retail stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is very common.</li>
            <li> and I was sick of painting my nails every 5 days, I was forced to search for a better way of doing my nails:  </li>
            <li> $40 later my nails were still thin and very short but the Gel manicure made them hard.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily true.</li>
            <li> No sticky nails for a while to mess up.</li>
            <li> I spent about $125 including the lamp thing and in a few months it will pay for itself!</li>
            <li> My back came broken and few of the bottles were nearly empty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this five stars because the brushes in the little bottles are slightly curled.  </li>
            <li> Gel nails lasts a very long time, at least 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    </li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly and leave noticeable growth; going two weeks would look really bad because of the growth although the polish has not chipped.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but if you get your hands in water (to bath my little girl) it will start to peel off.</li>
            <li> b/c it keeps forming a little cocoon of solution around the brush and then hardens.</li>
            <li> Wrap a little around the tips of your nails too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it get anywhere else...and don&#x27;t forget to cap the end of your nail tips a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;*Make</li>
            <li> And keep in mind, this product DOES spread out a little bit.</li>
            <li> on the tips, painting horizontally across the ends, and wrapping a little color around the tips.</li>
            <li> Wrap a little bit of the color around the ends of the acrylic tips too&lt;</li>
            <li> on the tips, painting horizontally across the ends, and wrapping a little color around the tips.</li>
            <li> Wrap a little bit of the color around the ends of the acrylic tips too</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little longer than it needs to.  </li>
            <li> My nails were weak and fragile  4.</li>
            <li> It took me a little over 1/2 hour from start to finish to do my manicure.  </li>
            <li> Cap the nail, meaning put a little polish on the edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you put a little polish on the edge it seals it.</li>
            <li> When you put a little polish on the edge it seals it.</li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to turn into a gookey mess and a waste of money</li>
            <li> Any little problems have to do with my novice painting techniques rather than Gelish.  </li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the box and the print on the bottles was to small to read even with a magnifying glass due to the color of print and the color of bottles.  </li>
            <li> Start with a pale one so mistakes show less as you practice this.  </li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  </li>
            <li> rather than keep buying the Artificial Nail Remover just buy pure acetone...</li>
            <li> Given this little bit of trouble, I&#x27;ll be sticking with the product line once I&#x27;ve used up the kit.  </li>
            <li> to save you a little time, here are a few things I learned over the years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to clip and file it down because it would not budge!</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that I&#x27;ve used the product for several weeks now</li>
            <li> /&gt;To remove the gel, saturate a cotton ball with the pink solution Artificial Nail Remover and put directly on nail, wrap it with a piece of tin foil</li>
            <li> but you can get quite a few applications out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of painting my nails or having them done only to have chips and peeling in a day.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> ;: I&#x27;ve had this happen a few times with both UV and LED lights.</li>
            <li> but if it does, at least you know it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Not &#x27;light shining through my nail tips&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble keeping the foil on.</li>
            <li> I invested in a few colors and change them every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I should add, a few of the Gelish brand polishes fade, so use caution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails done for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to find a few colors that I like.</li>
            <li> With any of these products don&#x27;t put on heavy coat.</li>
            <li> Moisture in the nails will be trapped by the polish and shorten the life of your manicure.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> There’s polish pooled on the sides, my cuticles are covered in polish, the layers are uneven.</li>
            <li> it’s a thin later, then I redip it in the bottle and finish that nail</li>
            <li> it’s a thin later, then I redip it in the bottle and finish that nail</li>
            <li> We did have trouble curing the color gel with the LED lamp</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money ...</li>
            <li> and although, it is a MINI size, I&#x27;ve used it quite a few time now.</li>
            <li> My kit was unopened but it was missing a bottle of</li>
            <li> but there are a few cons.  </li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream in the round tin.</li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream in the round tin.</li>
            <li> In a few minutes, you will see it start to crackle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to face the fact that I wasted all of my money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Well initially they were thin like tissue paper.</li>
            <li> I feel that it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I watched a few tutorials on youtube before I ordered it</li>
            <li> you get the uneven look</li>
            <li> you get the uneven look</li>
            <li> other complaint is that it came with two foundation gels and was missing the \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li> All the bottles are very small but don&#x27;t let that fool you, I JUST had to replace my top coat and base coat about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I find myself redoing at least one nail every other day.</li>
            <li> Wish the bottles of Nail Cleaner and Acetone were a little bigger, but that is the easier and less expensive product to replace.  </li>
            <li> I also got a bottle of plain acetone at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and a bottle of non-acetone polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike acrylics which are stiff and don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me waste of hard earned money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Don’t get discouraged if your first few manicures turn out bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about how small the containers were going to be</li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> Plus, I use two coats of the structure gel as I felt the polish alone just wasn&#x27;t tough enough for my hard working hands.</li>
            <li> The gelish kit arrived on time but the bottle labeled \\&quot;artificial nail remover was 3/4 empty and the entire box had a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> If one bottle in the kit is missing or has been replaced w a duplicate bottle of polish the entire kit is useless.  </li>
            <li> I had had no experience with gel products, but was tired of waiting for polish to dry</li>
            <li> I usually grow tired of the color long before it comes off</li>
            <li> I have weak nails and polish comes off after one day but with this stuff it stays on for 3 weeks and nails seem harder.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will make a little sharp &#x27;ledge&#x27; if you get sloppy, and this will tend to catch on things.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails and one that constantly splits.  </li>
            <li> It seems like this kit was either not stored correctly, or it was just way past</li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> But the dvd is small and I don&#x27;t have any players that can play it.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned that the sample sizes were small, and they are, but I caution you to use the product sparingly or else</li>
            <li> I wish it had a small sample of nail polish so that you can practice.</li>
            <li> It’s sometimes annoying, but the end result makes it worth</li>

            <li> so for years I have shelled out a small fortune having them done.  </li>

            <li> of the bottles in this kit are the small ones</li>
            <li> The contents are small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> The box was never opened, nor was the plastic wrap on the outside of it broken either!  </li>
            <li> Small bottles but</li>
            <li> If you paint the coats too thick, they won&#x27;t cure correctly and may start to peel after a few days.</li>
            <li> They are so small, I even got a magnifiy glass and still couldn&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> I cured for 60sec using the MelodySusie 12w LED lamp (didn&#x27;t try it for 30sec) and it dried in one shot!</li>
            <li> and I have done my nail many times with the mini bottles which is shocking</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s the pale, barely-there color, it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel hard and stiff like acrylics.</li>
            <li> they file them wrong, they look messy when dry, \\&quot;are</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d do my nails now and then but am a perfectionist and would get frustrated waiting so long for polish to truly be dry.</li>
            <li> I wear a very pale color (almost nude), so when they grow out its not that noticeable.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately it takes a lot longer than recommended  to dry and pealed off after 1 day.</li>
            <li> you can either do a color coat here at this step; if you do color, do a couple of THIN THIN layers, but this time stroke the color from cuticle to nail tip, one long stroke each time, so you don&#x27;t get color pooling at the front edge of the acrylic.</li>

            <li> Not acrylic hard</li>
            <li> It works just as well... isn&#x27;t too hard to do...</li>
            <li> With a little practice I might just start doing people&#x27;s nails on the side!!</li>

            <li> It stays on at least 1 week before any signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for at least two weeks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> I now have at least an 1/8 inch growth.</li>
            <li> Depending on how sensitive your skin is, it might be painful or just feel like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I received my basix kit and was somewhat disappointed, there was a leak in a bottle but not enough to send it back, I tried and the instructions were so small it made it difficult to read</li>
            <li> (at least once a month)and haven&#x27;t come close to running out yet.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s too late to return.  </li>
            <li> It loses a star because the directions on the box and bottles is unreadable because of text size and color.</li>
            <li> Wish the size of the nail cleanser &amp; Artificial nail remover were bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like at least a price match</li>
            <li> Just wish the polish wasn&#x27;t so thick and easier to apply</li>
            <li> 99% of the time, it&#x27;s going to be that your layers are too thick.</li>
            <li> too thick layers will peal easier.</li>

            <li> the bottles type/font is REALLY small!</li>
            <li> That means the small bottles in this kit lasted me 2 years!  </li>
            <li> Not a lot for what you pay for and the bottle were very small.</li>

            <li> bottles are very small.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the primer, base coat, top coat etc. were in small sizes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These bottles are very small, like a sample kit.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I was spending a ridiculous amount of money at the salon getting my nails done.</li>
            <li> hard to get thin cotes.  </li>

            <li> Before this my nails were short and ugly.</li>
            <li> Not good when bumping into things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaints/observations are these:&lt;br /&gt;The base coat (foundation) is way to thick, stringy, gooey.</li>
            <li> The ph base was completely evaporated, the gels are too viscous and gooey, resulting in a poor finish, even with the aid of curing lamp.</li>
            <li> Used to do acrylic, but that took to long, and the smell was bad.</li>
            <li> When you remove it, your nails are not stunted and weak like they are with acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I have weak nails that have tons of groves.</li>
            <li> For weak nails get the structure.</li>
            <li> I have always had weak, split nails.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasts at least 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s outrageous how much they charge!</li>
            <li> I have tried others and also a friend has recently tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Gel system and we have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> was small and totally expensive.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what im doing wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> Cut them down to size, soak them in the artificial nail remover, put them on the nails and wrap with foil.  </li>
            <li> I am a nurse and very hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have weak, paper thin nails.</li>

            <li> *I deleted the Red Carpet paragraph because I just found it to be worthless.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t get Gelish, Lomasi, or Red Carpet to &#x27;stick&#x27; to the ProGel base.</li>
            <li> My nails were thin as tissue paper after it was all removed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had nails that grew as they are thin and chip, split and break.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order this kit because i was tired of paying to get my nails done at the salon every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It’s thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Wipe the brush off well and apply a thin coat.&lt;br /&gt;11.</li>
            <li> Think thin:</li>

            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> The color was runny and did not adhere as a thin coat, so I had to use 2 coats.</li>
            <li> it will be approximate of course, but to give an idea.</li>
            <li> Something had clearly broken inside the envelope.</li>
            <li> also ordered the IBD Superbond base and a bottle of the Gelish \\&quot;Simple</li>
            <li> : Apply everything in thin coats, and don&#x27;t get polish on your cuticles or it will lift and peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I have previously tired either an acrylic or gel kit the nails pops off after three days or so.  </li>
            <li> I never experienced this at the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I gave 4 out of 5 because my pH bond bottle was broken during shipping</li>
            <li> Just follow the steps to a tee and put the coats on thin</li>
            <li> Use the pH Bond on each nail&lt;br /&gt;4)  Place a thin coat of Foundation on each nail and the tip of the nail....</li>
            <li> The 2 things that stand out in my mind is to avoid getting polish on your cuticles and fingers -- and to apply thin coats.</li>
            <li> The secret is to apply in THIN coats.</li>
            <li> The cuticle oil container was broken and oil was everywhere.</li>
            <li> should be THIN.</li>
            <li> They are very small!</li>
            <li> If you are a sloppy nail painter I do not recommend any gel system, as it is unforgiving one</li>
            <li> Usually after only hours, my nail polish chips and looks terrible by day 2.  </li>
            <li> that as soon as you take your fingers out of the UV lamp, it&#x27;s hard and you&#x27;re done!!</li>
            <li> I can do my base coat in 5 seconds and other coats in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> IBD is supposed to be a stronger bonding agent than the Gelish (or any other) base.</li>
            <li> After everything arrived I really put off trying it because I was sorta afraid that when I was finished my nails would look awful</li>
            <li> you have had a bad past experience</li>
            <li> (so weird) and is still noticeable after color is applied.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot get anything to stick to my nails.</li>
            <li> all coats of product THIN!</li>
            <li> (THIN!)</li>
            <li> (THIN!)</li>

            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a candidate for fake nails as I have hobbies that get in the way of fake nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fake nails</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but compared to my friends who get their manicures at a salon for $30</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> I hope my review helps anyone out who is skeptical....</li>
            <li> Sorry Gelish you wont be getting my money towards animal cruelty and suffering.</li>
            <li> Therefore the kit is useless.</li>

            <li> This product is not at all what I expected and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dark colors are especially difficult to learn to apply without getting the color under the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Common sense people!!!</li>
            <li> Anywhere the polish touches the skin is where it will lift and drive you crazy.</li>

            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 1 minute under UV light.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> so mad</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very difficult to read.  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad that you can&#x27;t work with them, because when you apply pressure, they do react and I can apply the liquid evenly.</li>
            <li> I figure that isn&#x27;t so bad compared to the 1 hour at the salon plus my driving time.  </li>
            <li> FUZZ IS BAD.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good Starter kit for Shellac. Includes everything you need to get started EXCEPT the light and color gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sizes are mini but you can get quite a few applications out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but if you get your hands in water (to bath my little girl) it will start to peel off. Not worth all the work.</li>
            <li> Super excited to be using this gel kit!!! I used to regularly get my nails done at a shop but not anymore. I save lots of time &amp; money now that I do my own nails. Very easy instructions &amp; excellent results, Extremely happy with this kit.</li>
            <li> I still have. I got it like more than 4 months and I still have it. Nice</li>
            <li> Perfect kit which looks like it will last long. Perfect use</li>
            <li> Love this whole kit cause it started my gel nail polish obsession I have now. But as I expand my collection and try new other gel brands, I have come to realize that the ph bonder in this kit isn&#x27;t that great. And also the foundation got really thick really quickly, so it&#x27;s a good started but now in retrospect I thing it would have probably been better for me if I would have went with a different starter kit, probably one that came with an LED light as well.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Gelish line and so far I&#x27;m impressed.  One of the reviews said to look for instruction videos on YouTube, so I did and that really helped.  I&#x27;ve had no chipping so far (been on for a week).  As others have said, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kit, but that&#x27;s fine for personal use (just replace the items that you run out of when the time comes).  Remember to purchase the color separately and you&#x27;ll need a LED or fluorescent lamp light for it to cure properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this gelish kit for about 2 years now. I&#x27;ve never had the problems I had with the kit I purchased from this seller (HAND &amp; NAIL HARMONY INC). The foundation solution formed little empty circles on my nails, about 3 or 4 little empty circles on each nail (so weird) and is still noticeable after color is applied. Also, the top it off solution brush would continuously need to be wiped off (causing most of the product to end up in the garbage) b/c it keeps forming a little cocoon of solution around the brush and then hardens. It seems like this kit was either not stored correctly, or it was just way past it&#x27;s expiration date and should have been thrown away - not sold! :(</li>
            <li> nice starter kit. i like it. small bottles and lots of uses thus far</li>
            <li> Excellent starter kit, it was delivered promptly...and &amp;#34;as described&amp;#34; just so you know this is a starter kit, everything is tiny, but priced right. Does not come with a color you need to order that separate.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit  over two months ago.  I have nails that when done in the salon or at home, the  polish starts coming off after about two days.  They break easy and I work out a lot and clean a lot which doesnt help the nails.  After doing some research and reading all the comments I purchased the Basix Kit and about 6 nail polishes.  I won&#x27;t be going back to the salon unless I&#x27;m just tagging along with a friend.  My nail polish literally stay on for weeks!  I just took off my last polish because my nails had grown out too much.  Other than that, they still looked fine after 3 1/2 weeks.  Follow the directions to a \\&quot;t\\&quot;.  A little polish goes a long way. Don&#x27;t coat it on thick and make sure you stay within the nail bed.  Definitely seal the edges throughout every step.  For darker polishes, sit under the dryer for minute or two longer during the last step.  If still tacky at the end after you&#x27;ve added the cleanser, just sit under the dryer for a bit longer instead of redoing the nails.  Most compliments with \\&quot;Good Gossip\\&quot; color.  Looks like Dorothy from Oz shoe color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set hoping to save some money on manicures.  The directions are easy to follow, the colors are great and the product works really well.  As I applied the product the first time, I was a little panicky because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not the surface should be sticky between layers.  I followed the directions and they turned out perfectly!  Would definitely purchase this set again...</li>
            <li> I got this product and used it and it seemed to work fine.  Then the second time I tried it the foundation still worked great, but the top it off got really sticky and gummy.  It was horrible.  I loved the gel polish manicures and I get it done at the salon all the time.  Think I will try a different brand.</li>
            <li> The Gelish Basix Kit (although small bottles) is plenty to do several manicures with. I have changed my polish 3x&#x27;s now. The Gelish system is fantastic. Just be sure to take your time and follow all the steps and you will have a chip free manicure. I have wore my pedicure for about a month now and am finally going to remove it. My manicures I have been changing about every 10 days but that has been for my own practice.</li>
            <li> This kit is just awesome.  It&#x27;s easy and looks great.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I was so tired of painting my nails or having them done only to have chips and peeling in a day.  I have done dishes, changed diapers and washed my hands a billion times and still they look awesome. Buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect for replacement for original one</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I could do my own gel manis at home. This is the kit the salon used so I figured this would be a great place to start. Unfortunately I cannot get anything to stick to my nails. This started peeling and lifting the next day. I followed directions to a T and did very light thin layers. No luck for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife as a gift, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Not able to get this to stay on for more then a week. I would like two weeks but that could be that I am in the water a lot. No complaints especially because with the light I purchased I am able to have beautiful nails in 15 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> hard to get thin cotes.  It does come off well though.  Just wish the polish wasn&#x27;t so thick and easier to apply</li>
            <li> Great system its as easy as painting your nails.  My nails look great. No more trips to the salon. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after seeing great reviews and I love it! Manicures are easy and long lasting without the expense of the salon.  This is the easiest manicure I&#x27;ve done!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It does not chip! I got a gelish at my local salon, and they did a horrible job with the application, but I loved the quality of the product. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and it will definitely pay for itself after a couple of uses. Please don&#x27;t be deterred by the word \\&quot;mini\\&quot;. It will last a long time because a little goes a long way. You can find a very limited selection of gelish polishes at your local sally beauty supply. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for first timers. I originally tried to do a gel manicure myself with a cheap 9 watt lamp, a base coat, a white polish for a french manicure, and then a top coat. It didn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money and time. The important thing to doing it yourself is getting at least a 32 watt lamp (I spent only $50 on mine, worked great) and this Gelish Basix kit. I read the previous reviews about doing all the steps in this, and they were right. It won&#x27;t cure properly without all the steps involved. Except the part about trimming cuticles, but that&#x27;s because I already have really dry cuticles and prefer them not to be cut. If you&#x27;re just starting out, this is perfect. I just finished my manicure and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is awesome...worth every penny. The pamphlet inside gives pretty clear instructions and there was an instructional dvd in the box as well. I didn&#x27;t use the dvd since I had been researching it a lot online before I bought and I had seen some videos already. I got fantastic results using a 14 watt uv light I purchased on Amazon. I&#x27;m pretty good at diy beauty and enjoy it, I can see some people not taking their time or reading the instructions with this. For those who aren&#x27;t into this type of thing or don&#x27;t like to take their time, just pay the salon to do it for you. If you are into diy beauty, BUY IT!. One thing I wondered before buying was how many applications this mini kit would provide...the pamphlet inside says 15-20 applications which is an amazing savings (even with the purchase of a uv light) over the cost of a salon application. I have short small nails too so I&#x27;m guessing I will get closer to 20 applications out of it. Love, Love, Love it. I hope gelish comes out with more polish colors and/or polish color kits.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails now and they look nice but they don&#x27;t survive as long as acrylic nails. I find myself redoing at least one nail every other day.</li>
            <li> This is my first time applying gel polish.  It was very easy.  I did watch a u-tube video on the process which I also believe made it easier, and also gave some good tips.  The product was well described and the directions made it so anyone could use it.  I&#x27;m lookiing forward to using this for a long, long time!  I also saved myself about $40 buying from Amazon compared to our local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I had gotten my first Shelac manicure at a salon and the girl had used Gelish color and said the two brands work together. I was going to buy all the steps and then found this starter kit with everything you need except a color. They are tiny bottles of the steps but I think they will last quite a while. It has instructions with it and a dvd as well. But the dvd is small and I don&#x27;t have any players that can play it. The written ones are pretty clear and easy to follow. You need a UV light as well, which I also ordered from Amazon. I tried it out on both my hands and feet and it seems to work as well as in the salon. It is pretty easy, and I think I will get better with time. You have to make sure you don&#x27;t get it on your skin or cuticles or it will not sure well and will peel off. I did have some peeling on a nail but I was able to do the steps and touch it up.   Overall, I think this is a great starter kit. You just need to add a color and a light.</li>
            <li> The kit is AWESOME I was a little nervous about how small the containers were going to be but they are perfect.  The pH bond and the Nourish will last a long time and I will only have to get a restock of the Foundation and The Top Coat sometime in the future.  The product looks really nice on your fingers and it is very durable.  My first manicure lasted about a week but I picked at them so that is why is didn&#x27;t last.  My second manicure lasted 2 weeks and I only had to redo my manicure because of my nail growth.  I love this product and love the compliments I get on my nails!!</li>
            <li> ***Updated everything, deleted old recommendations and added new products&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Gelish kit when it was on major sale at a beauty supply. I also bought a collection of polish colors. If I knew THEN how long-lasting a gel manicure is, I would not have amassed such a huge collection of regular polish! The gel manicures ROCK! [Update: Youtube &amp;#34;Gelly Sandwich&amp;#34; for videos on how to use regular polish with gel for quick-change color]&lt;br /&gt;When you first get this kit, don&#x27;t be shocked at how tiny everything is. I was really ticked off at first (because I didn&#x27;t read specifics when I bought it, thought I was getting full size products) but this is truly an intro-sized kit. Don&#x27;t be alarmed though, as there is plenty of product in the kit to get you through MANY manicures! I do both fingers and toes and the kit lasted a long time. You&#x27;ll use different amounts of products at a different pace, so just buy the components separately as you run out. You&#x27;ll even find some items are not truly necessary. Some people say there is enough product for 10-12 manicures but I got way, way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;You might find the instructions overwhelming at first, I would recommend you Youtube some instructional videos. There are hundreds of how-to videos on not only the basics of the gel manicure, but also special effects like french tips and nail art. You will be amazed at all you can do with the gel! Once you see the steps in action it makes reading through and utilizing the instruction manual much easier. Some kits have a mini-dvd; good luck with *that* thing. There are curing times listed on the back of the box. (Curing times are different with different brands and colors, be prepared)&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need, in addition to the kit: a UV or LED lamp, lint free nail polish removal pads, a microfine buffer, 70% alcohol would also be good. Updated note: SHAKE YOUR GEL POLISH WELL--all brands--before each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED LAMP NOTES: (SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE GET THE GELISH LIGHT) I first bought a 32w UV light to use with this instead of the 9w that was sold by the place I got the Gelish set from. The 32w seemed to make the steps work in the amount of time suggested in the Gelish instructions. My first attempt, with the lower wattage 9v UV light, created some problems with bubbling and lifting.  You might want to buy a tube of broad-spectrum SPF hand cream also if you are concerned about the effects of the lamp on your skin. There are fingerless gloves sold that help block the rays also.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have since found the UV light to be a less economical purchase. Not only does it take longer to process the gel, but you eventually have to replace the bulbs. As the bulbs age, you&#x27;ll start to notice issues with your nails. Most sites selling UV lamps professionally say you need to change them every &#x27;several years&#x27;. That, my friends, is hoo-ha!&lt;br /&gt;2015 UPDATE: Just save yourself the money and buy the Gelish light.  I made other cheaper lights work but once I got the Gelish light, I stopped having ANY issues whatsoever with any brand. I also use the builder gel (Harmony and IBD) to build my own nails and this light works with those too. Universal success across many brands with one light--NO MORE ISSUES. It&#x27;s worth the money I promise.  Five seconds for your base coat, 20 seconds color coat (regular colors) or 30 seconds dark colors, and 20 to 30 seconds for top coat. This is a lot less than the USpicy light that I used, and I wish now I&#x27;d just gotten the Gelish light to begin with.  The Gelish lamp does feel pretty warm though, it was a little shocking compared to what I was used to. It also seems to work so quickly that polish doesn&#x27;t have a chance to spread out like it does in other lamps. IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT GET THE GELISH LAMP TO BEGIN WITH: you will not be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I got SIX WEEKS out of my gel manicure with pale or clear polishes. The interesting thing about the gel is how strong it is, how strong it makes your nails (I had to clip my nails to shorten them, they were so break-proof!). The gel is substantial yet flexible, so it moves with your nails (sometimes we accidentally hit them on things!). This stuff wears off rather than chipping, and after the sixth week I ended up peeling some off. After eight weeks I finally peeled more off, you&#x27;ll probably need to soak it with acetone to remove it. It peeled off my nails cleanly and with no damage but that was after a long time. When you remove it, your nails are not stunted and weak like they are with acrylic nails. It&#x27;s well worth the time to do a gel manicure on yourself and if you use a very light color you can go a long, long time without any noticeable dings! (Note, I&#x27;m not advocating PEELING it off, but if you have had it on so long that it&#x27;s ready to give up, that&#x27;s different. Otherwise you could damage your nails if you peel something that isn&#x27;t ready to let go yet)&lt;br /&gt;NAIL ART: Put the decal on top of your color, before you put on the top coat and cure. The nice thing about gel color, is how STICKY it is, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get a decal on without lifting. I don&#x27;t use the water decals for many reasons (mainly because it wets the gel layer) but you can use them if you have much more patience than I do! The cured top gel layer makes a great sealant on nail art, and it will last and last. I have had mixed results with crystals and add-ons; sometimes if I set them into the top layer before curing, they will stick nicely for weeks. Other times, I look down one day and there is a hole where the crystal/item was. Oops. Regular nail glue on top of cured top coat will still hold them just like regular polish top coat, if you want to try that.&lt;br /&gt;TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;*I get six weeks out of the pale, sheer colors; by the time six weeks have gone by, my nails have grown and there are dings and chinks in the color here and there but since it&#x27;s the pale, barely-there color, it&#x27;s hard to tell. If you use any of the bright colors, you can probably get about 2 weeks or so before you either get edge wear or noticeable gap in color from the cuticle due to growth. Once the color starts lifting up and catching your hair at the cuticle edge, that&#x27;s usually enough to drive you nuts enough to remove it (or buff it down lightly and put on a new top coat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*First, use the nail square buffer to lightly rough the surface of your nails. Don&#x27;t saw back and forth, stroke it from cuticle to nail tip, lightly. Then take the &#x27;nail cleaner&#x27; (or 91% alcohol) product on your lint free cloth and swipe your nails. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on them.&lt;br /&gt;*Next you&#x27;ll use your &#x27;ph bond&#x27; product (or skip if you used alcohol)&lt;br /&gt;*Then use the foundation product; brush it on THINLY but cover your nail surface. Wrap a little around the tips of your nails too. THINK THIN......&lt;br /&gt;*If using a pale/sheer color you can get by with one coat. I like two. THIN THIN THIN, and wrap a little around the tips of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;*Top coat, again think thin. But make sure you carefully cover your nail surfaces with it. Don&#x27;t let it get anywhere else...and don&#x27;t forget to cap the end of your nail tips a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;*Make all coats of product THIN! THIN IS GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;*When you use it, avoid letting it get on your cuticles or running down the sides of your nails. If this happens, get an orange stick and take care of it before you set it! And keep in mind, this product DOES spread out a little bit. The best way to guarantee that your polish job will lift and peel off, is to not do thin layers, and to let this get outside of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure to take the time to carefully paint down the sides as far as you can, covering the color coat. This will help it last longer, without the lifting problems that can happen. Sometimes it will make a little sharp &#x27;ledge&#x27; if you get sloppy, and this will tend to catch on things. Or if you are like me, it will make you want to pick at it. You can take a buffer or light board and gently sand this ridge down, and do another stripe of top coat if you want to. If you don&#x27;t, the integrity of your polish job is compromised and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it starts to deconstruct. It&#x27;s up to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TROUBLESHOOTING:&lt;br /&gt;*If you consistently get &#x27;pliable, peely&#x27; color, there are several things to consider. 99% of the time, it&#x27;s going to be that your layers are too thick. Back off on how much you use, it really takes about half of what you think it does. (And the plus side is that it will go farther!)&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s still pliable after you&#x27;ve carefully applied THIN layers, consider that your light may be the culprit. I bought an LED light (look around for best price!) that is large enough for one whole hand; I didn&#x27;t find the &#x27;portable&#x27; lights (especially those that do 4 fingers!!) to be great. I also have UV light but I think that the bulbs are not as effective despite the ridiculous long life claims of the seller I bought them from. (UPDATE: The Gelish light solved every problem I ever had)&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second Gelish kit. UPDATE 8-22-12: I found a bottle of my Gelish base coat that was over a year old, was very thick and kind of gloppy. I used it anyway and am certain this is the culprit for several of my nails just popping off the entire color in one piece, like a fake nail. I tossed the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;IT FEELS LIKE MY NAILS ARE BURNING UP&amp;#34;: I&#x27;ve had this happen a few times with both UV and LED lights. Apparently this is very common. The worst burning I ever experienced was at a salon with Gelish Starburst with UV lamp, I thought it was just the fact that the tech was really putting it on and curing it too long, but this feeling can happen and doesn&#x27;t signify that you are being burned. Even though it can burn like a biotch! I&#x27;ve had it even with very thin coats. It probably won&#x27;t happen very often to you but if it does, at least you know it&#x27;s to be expected. It is a process of the color curing.&lt;br /&gt;*If you get color on your wipe when doing the cleansing step on your top coat, this means that not all the nail color was sealed with the top clear coat. It could just be some that ended up outside your nail bed (but I already told you not to let that happen!), but it is also likely there is a side that didn&#x27;t get all the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;FOR LONGER NAILS: You may find that a color isn&#x27;t as opaque as you like, when on your tips. It is frustrating when you can see light through your nail tips, or see strokes of color as the light shines through! I like to make my first base color coat (THIN!) on the tips, painting horizontally across the ends, and wrapping a little color around the tips. Bake that . Then go for layer 2 and even 3 if you need it, painting from cuticle to tip. I&#x27;ve found this is the best way to get opaque color to the very ends of my nails, especially when they are long, and it has dramatically increased edge wear on my darker colors. It only takes a few extra seconds for a longer color payoff. You won&#x27;t need more than 2 layers on your nail bed MOST of the time, but the tips are where you need opacity: with this horizontal first-layer method, you can get full color on your tips with no shine-through, and still get by with two coats on your nail bed, which helps stave off bubbling and lifting. I changed my mind about several Gelish polishes I was about to give away because they were so thin that I couldn&#x27;t be happy with the tips, now that is not a problem. By the time you add another two coats of color plus your top coat, you cannot tell there is a heavier layer on your tips.&lt;br /&gt;USING THEM WITH ACRYLIC NAILS: I made the mistake of getting some acrylic nails for a wedding; the guy did a bad job on top of picking tips that make it look like I have Frito Scoops on the ends of my fingers. (Where&#x27;s the bean dip?!?!?!) Here is how I dealt with that fugly garbage!&lt;br /&gt;**As the acrylic nail grows out, you get that space between it and the cuticle, and that HUMP right where the acrylic starts. That&#x27;s also where you&#x27;ll get lifting and stuff like your hair getting caught in it UGH. So take that nail dremel and put on the barrel sanding attachment. You&#x27;ll hold it at an angle and just take that &#x27;hump&#x27; of acrylic on that edge, down to where it&#x27;s NOT to the nail but not still...hump-y. While you are at it, you might run the barrel attachment down the sides, you know how sometimes you get lifting edges down there too? You&#x27;ll just want to smooth that down. If you got the person who thinks acrylic nails should be an inch thick, then go ahead and lay that barrel parallel to the nail surface and work some of that extra thick acrylic down too, in back and forth motions. No sense in looking like you bring your own Frito chips to the party.&lt;br /&gt;*And then just lightly, carefully, rough up the nail bed between the cuticle and acrylic nail area. With your buffer block, NOT THE DREMEL!&lt;br /&gt;*I use a lint free wipe to wipe down the area with alcohol, to get the dust off. You can either leave it at that or use the PH Bond. I know a lot of people say oh it&#x27;s just alcohol (it has something else in it too), but hey if you have the bottle you may as well use it up.&lt;br /&gt;*Next is the foundation. I paint it THINLY on the acrylic nail first, and then I start from the cuticle and paint towards the acrylic nail to cover the new growth area. I found that if you have had some lifting at the edge, this helps make a nice seal.&lt;br /&gt;*Then you can either do a color coat here at this step; if you do color, do a couple of THIN THIN layers, but this time stroke the color from cuticle to nail tip, one long stroke each time, so you don&#x27;t get color pooling at the front edge of the acrylic. Wrap a little bit of the color around the ends of the acrylic tips too&lt;br /&gt;*next you do the top coat, again one long stroke each time, and make sure to wrap it around the ends a little. Just helps make it look good longer&lt;br /&gt;If you use a sheer color you can pretty much make the acrylic nails invisible with this method, or something light. I found that a bright color emphasized the &#x60;hump&#x27; area, but the lighter colors made the acrylic and real nail appear pretty seamless. You&#x27;ll be surprised once you do all the layers, how even the whole thing looks! The gel polish fills in the gap between your new nail growth and the acrylic. It took me several months but I eventually got to the point that when I clipped my nails to shorten them one day, the acrylic was so far to the tips of my nails that it just broke off. Voila, no weak soggy breaking nails! *OH one thing I forgot to mention: if you ever see darkness or discoloring under your nails as you are growing these out, remove your acrylic! It&#x27;s probably fungal growth and you need to get that acrylic off!&lt;br /&gt;(NEW) BUILDER GEL: You can use IBD or Harmony Builder Gel to fill in your growth. You&#x27;ll need the ProBond IBD and IBD Bonder (superior to Gelish) no matter which brand you buy. The process is more complicated and I&#x27;d recommend some Youtube videos. It takes a bit of practice but is amazingly easy and you can get the supplies for less than the cost of a fill in at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;*if you soak off the gel, the product used to soak off the gel will also affect the integrity of your acrylic nail.

So if you already have the Gelish and want to explore Red Carpet&#x27;s color realm, you don&#x27;t need to buy their kit to do it! But I did use LED light for this. I have since found that I prefer the dramatically shortened cure time (and longevity of the light) of the LED. My first color was \\&quot;Camera Flash\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not opaque enough for me for fingernails but they have other colors. Most of the Red Carpet I relegated to toes, where opacity on long nails is not an issue. 8-22-12: While I like that Red Carpet&#x27;s gel colors work with the Gelish kit, I have decided to not recommend Red Carpet any more. So many of their colors are mid to sheer, and with the four layers needed to get even relative opacity, come bubbling and lifting. I like how easy the Red Carpet goes on, but lasting power? Nah. Opacity? nah. I&#x27;ve purchased at least 50% of their available colors and when I want an opaque color, that&#x27;s what I want. Not &#x27;light shining through my nail tips&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*LOMASI: I used the Lomasi brand of color (Here, no longer sold by Ulta) and so far it&#x27;s great with the Gelish products. In fact I almost hate to say it but I think I like the Lomasi brand of color better. I&#x27;ll try their base and topcoats and see how they compare to Gelish. Lomasi is slightly more costly but the application and wear are top notch. 8-22-12: Right now Lomasi is THE brand I love. I have given away almost all my Red Carpet colors and find that I reach for Lomasi first now. I love their base and top coats, and their colors are RICH. Two coats, smooth and opaque and they STICK. I get good results with Lomasi color whether using my Gelish base/top or the Lomasi brand. As my Gelish runs out, I&#x27;m replacing it with Lomasi. The brushes in the bottles are superior to the dinky Gelish/Red Carpet brushes. The overall feeling of the Lomasi nails, is &#x27;sturdier&#x27; and thicker.My nails feel more like I have acrylic nails on, which I like as I hate having breakage on my nails and I use them a LOT. (Since Lomasi is harder to find, I have gone back to Gelish for top/bottom. But still love their rich, quality colors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PROGEL: Loved that the bottles were huge. Loved the great brush they have for the products! But I can&#x27;t get Gelish, Lomasi, or Red Carpet to &#x27;stick&#x27; to the ProGel base. Within a few days of using the ProGel as the base, any color pretty much pops off as a whole piece, leaving whatever nail (at least 2 per manicure within days) to look like I had put on press on nails. How embarassing. I paid $14.50 a bottle, I&#x27;d rather spend the $11.50 for Lomasi (or whatever price you may find it for). I&#x27;m using proper preparation so I don&#x27;t know WTH is up with the ProGel. Won&#x27;t buy more that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SHELLAC/CND: I bought \\&quot;Strawberry Smoothie\\&quot; and at first was annoyed that the bottle did not seem to match the picture. This is very sheer, and the photo online appeared to be a frosty pink. However, after using it, and achieving what seems like the perfect neutral go with anything nail, I love this. I love how the Shellac applies, how it cures, and how it wears. (Warning, it does smell like normal nail polish until you cure it!) I love how absolutely rock-hard and glassy it feels. I never wonder, wow did I cure this properly?? It also works perfectly with the Lomasi brand of top/base coats. Works with Gelish. Most Shellac colors I have had to cure longer than with Gelish. Try 30 seconds base, 60 each color, 60 top coat. For darker colors, and for 3rd layers, try 30 base/60 1-2 coats/90 3rd coat/90 top coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at the end of the day if I had to rank all these products in order of preference, with QUALITY and ease of use being the factors (not price):&lt;br /&gt;*Gelish and Shellac would share the top spot for application, endurance, some Gelish has opacity problems but just follow my trick for the horizontal tip-painting and see how that works for you&lt;br /&gt;*Lomasi is now second runner up because it&#x27;s hard to find and pricey. But it&#x27;s some of the most opaque polish I&#x27;ve ever found, especially pinks&lt;br /&gt;*Red Carpet only if I had to (and mostly only on my toes....)&lt;br /&gt;*Progel NEVER</li>
            <li> I have weak nails and polish comes off after one day but with this stuff it stays on for 3 weeks and nails seem harder.</li>
            <li> The product performed what I expected it to but I think instructions would have been helpful. Also the remover is such a minimal amount it will be gone in no time! Overall for a mini size, the kit met expectations.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to find Gelish and how well my nails are doing with it!!! I have weak nails that have tons of groves. I have been battling gorgeous nails all my life - and had to resort to acrylics - that made things worse!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is just for me... My Acrylics were gorgeous pink and Whites - but - I was done paying 45 Dollars a month. I had to find something better in this economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily - I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice - Buy a GREAT UV lamp. DO not buy the Piece o crap lamp that is sold at Sally&#x27;s ( the teeny one)&lt;br /&gt;Now I have french manicures - all at home.. No splitting nails. and I can always look \\&quot;polished\\&quot; lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don;t really do colors - so this is perfect for me. It is difficult to remove - but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ususally use two coats of foundation.. use a brush to clean up my smile line with white Gelish 2 times, then hit it with a coat of Top it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and decided to get it based on the positive reviews.  In using it myself, I love this system and prefer it over paying $30 a pop in the salon.  Is it as good as a professional?  No, but in only doing my nails three times with this system, I have gotten many compliments.  I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it since I&#x27;m a novice.  I purchased colors from eBay (the same Gellish brand) and I love those as well.  I had already had a bottle of 100% acetone and suggest using that instead of buying it from the company. Get it from Walmart to take the nails off.  I do the same thing in the salon of using cotton and foil to wrap my nails and in less than 15 minutes, the gel is off.  I listened to the other reviewers in that I did not use cotton balls to finish off the nails - I use a cotton free towel which has worked well.  This system is highly recommended especially if you&#x27;re tired of paying through the nose at the salon.</li>
            <li> First, this seller is awesome. Well packed and a speedy delivery (several days before the estimated arrival).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for what you really want to know - how does it work? EXCELLENT! I&#x27;m a perfectionist, so I&#x27;ve always had problems with other people doing my nails... they file them wrong, they look messy when dry, \\&quot;are you trying to make me bleed,\\&quot; etc.(you know, they&#x27;re just not... perfect.). I bought the 36 watt dryer for under $30, followed the timing guidelines on the back of the Gelish Basix Kit, and have amazing nails right now. I even went crazy and did black with a glitter french tip and can&#x27;t believe how good they look. The salon I (used to) go to uses the Gelish stuff, so I know I&#x27;ll have to take the polish off long before I ever get a chip simply because my nails will have grown so much. Another reviewer mentioned that the sample sizes were small, and they are, but I caution you to use the product sparingly or else it gets thick quick with all the layers - a little goes a loooong way. all around, an amazing product that will save you lots of money in the end! So happy right now :-)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of doing my own nails after having a gel polish manicure in a salon.  When I when back to have the polish removed, my nails were ruined!  The technician had me soak my nails in acetone and then proceeded to file off the remaining gel polish.  My nails were thin as tissue paper after it was all removed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reviewing other comments, I decided to try it on my own.  I am so glad I did!  Best home mani EVER!!  I made sure to follow the directions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and had no problems with removing the gel polish and my natural nails were in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had a bad past experience, I suggest you purchase your own mini kit and follow the directions precisely!  You will never pay $35 in a salon again!!</li>
            <li> i bought the basix kit along with june bride, little princess and sleek white for french manicures. it turned out perfect the first time i tried it. after 2 and a half weeks it was still shiny and chip free, i had to soak it off merely because my natural nail grew out quite far!!</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect! Small enough just for trying the product. The product is awesome, it lasts for about two weeks and protects my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a real started kit  It does what it says on the tin.  It would have been nice to have included a colour  in the box as well.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit to use the Gelish products and to help decide which products you will continue to use and which products you will supplement with similar items (I.e. rubbing alcohol, acetone). If you don&#x27;t go for the set I suggest you purchase the foundation and top it off. For weak nails get the structure. You can use rubbing alcohol to clean nails and purchase any acetone to remove polish. Any cuticle oil can nourish your skin, and you should use oil as the process can really dry your skin out. I really like Gelish products. It is fairly easy to use and low maintenance. It lasts 10 plus days! My final recommendation is to use lint free or fuzz free wipes, otherwise you will be dealing with fuzzies stuck in your polish which is no fun. Especially after all the work you put into painting them. Good luck in finding the perfect product and enjoy your nails!</li>
            <li> Just started doing my own gels. Follow the directions and you will have a great manicure in no time. I am  extremely hard on my nails so my gels last about a week and a half before they start to chip or peel.  Much longer then regular polish (one to three days). I cannot wait to get some more colors!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the products yet, but sure they will be fine.  Purchased the smaller kit because thought would stay &#x27;fresh&#x27; better than the larger sizes.  Package was &#x27;squished&#x27; because it was sent in a padded mailer, but products were intact.&lt;br /&gt;It does come with an instructional DVD which would not work in my MacBookPro, which only accepts 4 1/2\\&quot; discs and this DVD is a &#x27;mini&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other complaint is that it came with two foundation gels and was missing the \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; cuticle oil.  The package was sealed so don&#x27;t think it was a fault of this seller, but did not receive what was supposed to be in the box, but too inconsequential to return.  Guess will just use sesame oil or something in place.</li>
            <li> I am a novice to the gel nail polish thing, but I bought the OPI starter kit with the polishes and it was difficult to work with, the polishes will very gooey, the brush was extremely narrow and it was very time consuming to prep the natural nail.  So I decided to try this kit, it was a fraction of what I paid for the OPI gel nail polish kit.  My nails turned out great, not a lot of prep and the color looked amazing.  I only bought the starter kit and one other polish to get started but I am back to buy more polishes.</li>
            <li> First of all, my kit came (sealed) with an open PH bottle that had emptied into the box.  Fortunately, it wasn&#x27;t really necessary.  The only two items you need from this kit are the foundation and the top coat.  The nail surface cleanse and PH can be substituted with alcohol pads ($1.99 at Target in the pharmacy section).  The Nail Remover is just acetone for the most part (also available at Walmart/Target for super cheap).  The \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; is just cuticle oil, which isn&#x27;t really necessary and can also be purchased elsewhere inexpensively.  I would save your money and just get two regular sized bottles of the base and top coats (instead of the mini ones that come with this set).  That said, everything works great and I&#x27;m happy with the products.  I just won&#x27;t bother with this kit again.</li>
            <li> I always love gellish polish and gellish itself.  And I will always recommend these awesome products to everyone who wants extra protection to their natural nails or even fake nails it work&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I just received my gelish mini basix kit from Amazon and did my first DIY gel polish. My nails are beautiful!. I had been paying $30 to have them done in a salon.I have had many compliments on them!&lt;br /&gt; Removing the old polish took me quiet awhile. I had trouble keeping the foil on. Also, I don&#x27;t think I filed the old polish off enough. I was a little nervous about filing too deep. Next time I will probably use the soak off gel wraps and file a little more off. I am very pleased with the way they turned out.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the old polish, everything else was easy to use. My only problem was no instructions or instructional DVD came with it. But,I had watched several videos online so I was somewhat familiar with the process.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 36 watt u spicy gel light and am very happy with it.I will definitely keep doing my own nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of this, so my nails are not yet salon quality (there will be a learning curve if your not a professional)  Kit does not include color, Lint Free Wipes or UV dryer, make sure to buy them before you start... I&#x27;d also suggest watching some youTube video&#x27;s of the process prior to this DYI project to get some tips.  I bang my nails around all day &amp; they remain unblemished &amp; without chips for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> First time doing gel nails on myself and this starter kit was great. After doing many sessions and talking to others, I found out that you only really need the base aka &amp;#34;foundation and the top coat aka &amp;#34;top it off&amp;#34;. The ph bond and the nourish is extra stuff you don&#x27;t really need. Overall, its a great buy if you are just starting.</li>
            <li> I love this starter set for helping me learn the process of Gelish nails.  As other reviewers have said, you need more than just this kit to do your nails; but it&#x27;s an economical way to get started.  I didn&#x27;t give this five stars because the brushes in the little bottles are slightly curled.  It would be easier to apply a nice thin even coat with better quality brushes.  It&#x27;s not so bad that you can&#x27;t work with them, because when you apply pressure, they do react and I can apply the liquid evenly. It just takes a little longer than it needs to.  If I run out of the products at about the same rate, I&#x27;ll probably just order another set because it&#x27;s so much more economical than buying individually.   It takes me about 2 hours to remove and recoat.  I figure that isn&#x27;t so bad compared to the 1 hour at the salon plus my driving time.  I may get faster with practice.  Oh, and it defintely takes a while to soak these off..but that&#x27;s why my nails are so much stronger and have such a nice glossy coat for two weeks!</li>
            <li> My natural nails have a nice shape but are so flimsy that they can&#x27;t survive the rigors of my job, hobbies, or day to day chores. I don&#x27;t care for what I call the \\&quot;salon scoops\\&quot; look. Most of the gals I know that have their nails done professionally, acrylics, or whatever, come out looking like they have these thick, white-tipped little spatulas growing out of the ends of their fingers. Very artificial looking. I&#x27;ve always thought there should be something out there that I could simply coat my natural nails with to allow them to grow out long and strong, but a traditional manicure never lasted more than a day, ditto on wraps, hardeners, etc. Plus I wanted something that was do-it-yourselfer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish is the answer. After using this product for a month, my nails are beautiful! My last manicure lasted nearly two weeks, and as hard as I am on my hands, I don&#x27;t forsee it ever going past that, but, as I said, regular polish never lasted more than a day or two, if I didn&#x27;t manage to gunk it up before I ever got the top coat on. One key to making the manicure last is getting a good coat on the free edge of the nail, and that wasn&#x27;t easy with my first couple of times because my nails were short. So the first couple times didn&#x27;t last as long. The free edge starts to wear first, and then the polish can lift and peel. It&#x27;s also important to not run the products up on the cuticle, as that is another place for it to lift and peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can say I have with this system is the time factor, I guess. When you put on the top coat, cure it, and cleanse your nails, you are done. No guarding the polish til it gets fully hard, it&#x27;s good to go. However, between coats, your nails are tacky and a real fuzz magnet. FUZZ IS BAD. You can&#x27;t quit midway so I have to find a time when I can get through a manicure uninterupted. Soaking off the old polish, filing, cleaning, takes me a minimum of 30 minutes, base coat, top coat, two coats of polish and curing time between. Plus, I use two coats of the structure gel as I felt the polish alone just wasn&#x27;t tough enough for my hard working hands. I already had a one bulb UV light that I can carefully put both hands in at the same time, but I&#x27;ve been going three minutes just to be on the safe side. I may spring for an LED light in the future just to save some time. I guess this is all offset by the fact that I won&#x27;t have to repeat the process for two weeks if I don&#x27;t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this product. It&#x27;s the best thing to come along since the fork. My nails are long, beautiful, strong and natural. Will continue to use it and order from this seller who is very prompt.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent way to get familiar with the Gelish products, without the upfront investment.  The Basix Kit contains everything (besides the UV lamp, and lint free wipes) that you need to get started at home.  My only disappointment is that I&#x27;ve used the product for several weeks now and I&#x27;m getting these tiny hard lumps within the gel, they aren&#x27;t clearly visible until I cure them under the lamp, so it&#x27;s hard for me to scrape them off before I \\&quot;set/cure\\&quot; my nails.  I&#x27;m wondering if my product is old.  Given this little bit of trouble, I&#x27;ll be sticking with the product line once I&#x27;ve used up the kit.  I expect to have enough product for several months of manicures. **EDITED TO ADD: I wasn&#x27;t being careful to not expose the bottle to the UV lamp while it was on; I have purchased a new bottle of polish since and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the hard lumps. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail fanatic off and on since I was a teenager in the 1970&#x27;s. Back then the coolest thing was when they came out with a green or blue color but that was about it. In the 80&#x27;s I wore acrylic nails with a trip to the salon every two weeks for repairs and fill-ins, did that for years! Then I took a hiatus from that and never did go back to it. I&#x27;d do my nails now and then but am a perfectionist and would get frustrated waiting so long for polish to truly be dry. Or two days later one would chip and I wouldn&#x27;t have time to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I treated myself to the new gel polish I&#x27;d been hearing about and had my nails done at the salon before a vacation. I was so totally thrilled with it! It was amazing how it was dry and ready to go minutes after the last coat. But that was just the beginning. My French manicure lasted 3 weeks and could have lasted even more... The amazing thing was how shiny it still was, and I&#x27;m a klutz with my hands, not to mention I wash my hands 10 million times a week, it seems, being in the health care field and I garden, etc. This polish held up like nothing had ever done before. It was nothing short of amazing, everyone&#x27;s dream come true if you are into nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out it could be done at home. I got everything I needed and spent maybe $100 total. My first manicure turned out flawless, and I did a French manicure on myself for the first time ever. Tips and tricks are on YouTube. If you don&#x27;t get the tip right you have endless chances to do it over because you can remove your mistake with non acetone polish remover ( use a brush to&lt;br /&gt;get the smile line right) and it doesn&#x27;t affect your base color layer since that is cured already when you go to do the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like a miracle to me, this is what I fantasized about as a teenager, some kind of indestructible polish that stayed fresh and new looking forever. I LOVE THIS STUFF! The only problem for me now is it lasts so long I have to wait to try the next color combo!</li>
            <li> Professional quality - love the $aving as long as I have enough time &amp; patience to slow down enough to do a good job. I did have to print out instructions from the internet thought - the bottles type/font is REALLY small!</li>
            <li> I got this set as a Christmas gift it took some getting used to to get it right but once you get it right it works great! I can&#x27;t wait to get a bigger uv lamp and more colors.. I&#x27;m happy with the product..</li>
            <li> I liked this kit for the most part. New to Gel nail polish, I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it is to get it OFF when you want to. It literally sticks that good. I used a UV light with this polish and it worked great. This includes everything you need except for the color!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping...you get full sized polishes and smaller cleanser and polish remover to help you get started with your gel polish manicure. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. No good directions included but there are tons of instructional videos on Youtube. My biggest tip is to have manicure sticks to clean excess polish off your skin/around the edges, and apply thin coats. too thick layers will peal easier.</li>
            <li> I love gelish! So much more cost effective than going to get my nails done every other week. I absolutely LOVE the fact that I can choose whether or not I purchase their own nail polish, or even use something like Essie and it stays on all the same!</li>
            <li> Love Gelish! I will never go back to regular nail polish</li>
            <li> Wonderful Starter Kit. Bottles are tiny compared to a regular size bottle, but PLENTY. The box has instructions on the back of it so it helps when you are just starting out. Works with CND brand as well. I like that it has all the items to do your nails. Don&#x27;t need to buy anything else except the nail polish. I wish it had a small sample of nail polish so that you can practice.</li>
            <li> I actually love the product its the customer service that sux...The gelish kit arrived on time but the bottle labeled \\&quot;artificial nail remover was 3/4 empty and the entire box had a chemical smell. I called amazon to tell them to replace just the empty bottle and I got the biggest run around about how Id have to send the whole thing back and wait for a refund then order another one.....so that&#x27;s why I only gave it a four ! great product bad customer service !</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and just applied the kit yesterday.  The results were amazing!  Compared to traditional polish, this was fantastic.  I can&#x27;t speak to the durability yet, since I just applied yesterday, but the finish seems very tough.  Make sure to apply the coats very thin to get the best results.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great products but doesnt come with instructions. I easily found some online though.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to get gel manicures at $36 every two weeks, so I bought this kit, one light harmony gelish color [[ASIN:B003VMTZ8C Harmony Gelish Uv Soak Off Gel Polish -Light Elegant (0.5 Oz)]]and the Thermal Spa uv light [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] to start doing it at home. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and my manicure looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: they&#x27;re easy to use - on the box it gives instructions on the order in which to apply them and the UV curing times, so I just line them up in that order before I start my manicure and have the box handy for the # of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: be aware the bottles are mini, not the full-sized.  Also, they are the only gelish nail products I could buy with my Amazon prime account and you don&#x27;t really need everything in the kit: the soak off (can use acetone) or the \\&quot;Nourish&#x27; which is just cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I now know what I need, I&#x27;ll probably buy the items separately next time, but again, I&#x27;m happy with them because the process was easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Great product. Brand new just as the description said. The shipping was very fast! The set was a great deal, the price was right and worth the money. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great starter set. I gave it as a Mothers day gift and she loved it and could hardly wait to use it. The instructions are vague but there is a great video on you tube on how to use this Gelish Kit.</li>
            <li> 1)midwest+2)winter+3)nails that split and peel&#x3D;nasty looking nails.  This product has been wonderful!  It stays on at least 1 week before any signs of wear.  And, I&#x27;m not ashamed to let others see my nails.  Thank-You!</li>
            <li> Gives you a good idea of how this product works for you before you invest in the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I have never had nails that grew as they are thin and chip, split and break.  So while on vacation I decided to try a gel nail polish and see how it stood up to regular polish.  My sister and her daughter got regular polish.  After 3 weeks I got home and polish still looked good but was growing out so needed to come off.  Meanwhile sister and niece had already removed their polish that was peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to invest in the system and bought the Gelish system, ordered a LED light (which I highly recommend) and went to town.  There is a learning curve, but I love my nails now.  I invested in a few colors and change them every few weeks.  I do my toes now too.  I should add, a few of the Gelish brand polishes fade, so use caution.  But overall, I highly recommend this system.  I do the 15 minute soak off with foil.  Toes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a candidate for fake nails as I have hobbies that get in the way of fake nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is waiting for them to go bad so I can try a new color.  Ha, ha.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use. No issues with this set and what a money saver! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This kit IS tiny, but I can see how it would last a VERY long time! I was very careful when first applying (even though I&#x27;ve had this process done at the salons)...but my nails turned out beautifully!!! If you&#x27;re wanting to &#x27;try out&#x27; gel nails, this is the perfect kit to use.  I had to buy a color separately, a UV lamp as well as gloves without fingertips, but it was all worth it for gorgeous nails.  Here&#x27;s a tip: My nails grow REALLY fast and the first application had too much polish on my cuticles which caused lifting after just a few days. When I redid my nails, I was super careful to put a VERY THIN layer near my cuticles, however, I used the included cuticle oil twice a day and by the end of the week, my nails looked SUPER fresh.  After a week, I applied 1 new layer of top coat and cured it. This along with my twice daily cuticle oil treatment makes all the difference in prolonging the beauty of these gel nails!</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Great service and got it fast.  Good to have a kit for  starting out doing gel nails.</li>
            <li> This product is so worth raving about. Because i like to watch my spending and I was sick of painting my nails every 5 days, I was forced to search for a better way of doing my nails:  1. I didn&#x27;t want to go to the salon every 2 weeks  2. I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for layers to dry to put on another layer  3. My nails were weak and fragile  4. I always like to look my best  If any/all of these apply to you, Gelish is your answer! I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty and picked up this starter kit along with some colors. I&#x27;m so happy I did! With a little practice I might just start doing people&#x27;s nails on the side!! Comes with instructional DVD that breaks down everything. The shine on the nails is amazing! I&#x27;ve had my nails done for a few days and I&#x27;m ROUGH on my nails (opening boxes for several hours a day) and my nail polish has stayed in tact.  Now let me just say that prior to Gelish, I would use OPI every 5-8 days to maintain a neat manicure. Now, I don&#x27;t worry about it. Hell, I might even give my coveted OPI collection to my sister now. I&#x27;m not one to rant and rave about a product but I was compelled to write this.  ADVICE: Purchase a 36 watt UV lamp not the rinky dink one made by GELISH when you buy this. Also I will warn you that initially it is an investment (about $100), but well worth it if I don&#x27;t have to redo my nails every 5 days.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this kit!  I just did my first gel manicure at home and it looks like I paid for a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look up a tutorial on YouTube to be sure I used to product correctly because the directions (if you could call them that) on the box aren&#x27;t specific.  One suggestion, be sure to apply thin layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how easy it was to do this and how professional my nails look.  It normally costs me $30 to get my gel set at the salon.  This kit costs about that and despite the small bottles, it is going to last for quite a while.  Absolutely worth it, invest in the kit, some colors, and a dryer and save yourself $30 every three weeks!!</li>
            <li> Great idea for new customers who are trying out the routine of doing their own gel nails. Also would like a little more liquid material in the new box.</li>
            <li> No issues. Works well. I like the timer, so I don&#x27;t have to guess if I&#x27;ve kept my nails in long enough. I&#x27;m SO glad I don&#x27;t have to do each nail individually!  Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so well, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Walmart sells the same stuff in a much cheaper package. I wish I had seen it before I shelled out for this stuff. I&#x27;m only buying my gel from them from now on, eventually all of these companies will start realizing there&#x27;s COMPETITION out there and knock it off with the ripoff prices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great starter kit and the instructions are amazing. Follow the steps and viola, and actually i did a pretty good job for doing it the first time. I&#x27;m just a regular person with no experience on manicure. I bought the U/V light and i&#x27;m very proud of my job, and my nails don&#x27;t look thick.</li>
            <li> Pro: Long lasting, Chip free, High Gloss, Dries completely after curing it under UV light&lt;br /&gt;Con: Thins out nails, expensive, time consuming, heavy use of UV Light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:I LOVE LOVE LOVE GELISH however, I will probably only use it for special occasions and when I am going on vacation.</li>
            <li> small, but good to start with! i am happy with my buy :) i can now have perfect gelish nails!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying gel nails.  This kit gave me the opportunity to try them without spending a fortune.  I have used it for 2 months now and absolutely love the product.  I would highly recommend getting an electric nail drill to go along with this.  It makes the removal so much faster.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It makes my nails longer and stronger and it is durable. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> These are mini so don&#x27;t be suprised when it arrives. It&#x27;s a great kit to get started and see if you want to do your own at home shellac mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s. The gelish website provides excellent instructions on how to use all the products. After one manicure it pays for itself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!! These are the same products used at my nail salon.</li>
            <li> I have no experience in manicures, but did this myself and it looks beautiful! Cotton balls will get fibers on your nails so make sure you get lint-free nail wipes and a 180 grit file to use with this kit. Of course you&#x27;ll also need a UV nail lamp. Follow the instructions that are on the \\&quot;nail harmony\\&quot; website and your nails will look great! I also manicured my toenails with this kit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for maintaining nails between salon appointments, or even as a replacement. At first, I winced at price of kit and UV lamp (36 watt, Salon Supply Store online, $25), but now I can have numerous applications for the price of a single trip to the salon. N.B. I don&#x27;t use the gel polish, which is about $12 or thereabouts. I just use regular polish, even the cheap stuff, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Great starter product. Everything you need to get started, plus clear instructions. My nails look awesome. and stay \\&quot;no chip and glossy\\&quot; for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to compare it to Shellac.  I have had equal amount of success with this as i have had with shellac (and it is cheaper).  very glad i tried it.  i</li>
            <li> Despite a lot of great reviews, I purchased this kit with some hesitation. A number of years ago I went to a salon where they did this kind of gel system. My friends who had it done had great success...but mine quickly lifted from the sides of my nail. I figured that I would be happy to get a week out of this system. I did my nails 4 days ago, and no sign at all of chipping or lifting. So far, I am very satisfied with the kit. I also purchased Need a Tan - even with two coats, the color is considerably lighter than I anticipated. I&#x27;m hoping to find a few colors that I like.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this kit because i was tired of paying to get my nails done at the salon every 3 weeks. It was $25 (+tip) each time i got my nails done, plus the gas money to drive to the salon. So- i thought- what the heck- i can do this myself. I am by far- no nail pro. I honestly am terrible when i do my nails at home. I got this kit today and tried it out (using the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer, and It&#x27;s a Lilly gelish polish). I took my time making sure i put the polish on slowly- and WOW! It turned out great. Just like the salon (except no tip and no gas money spent). Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> As pictured. As described. A+. I have only used it on fake nails and not on my real nails yet but I love the finish it gives.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experimented around with these products much. However, upon opening up the package both the pink and blue solutions were exploded all over the box holding them. It looks like the seal is still in place so I have no idea how the contents leaked all over the package. It&#x27;d be great if I could get those replaced but it doesn&#x27;t like that is a possibility with this product. Also, mine did not come with instructions in the box.</li>
            <li> THE PROBLEM I HAD, WAS THE PH BOND WAS EMPTY WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  I FIGURE IT IS A MANUFACTURERS PROBLEM AS THE PACKAGE WAS SEALED IN PLASTIC WRAP.  BUT THE OTHER BOTTLES IN PACKAGE WERE FINE</li>
            <li> This is only a mini kit, but more than enough to get you started.  Also a great place to start to be sure you want to do your own manicures/pedicures.  Just follow the instructions and it works great.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit, one Gelish color, and a 48 watt UV light.  I have used it once so far and I love it!  It took me a little over 1/2 hour from start to finish to do my manicure.  I can do dishes, clean, whatever and my nails don&#x27;t chip!  I used to have polished nails all the time and then I stopped when I had kids because I didn&#x27;t have the time to spend waiting for regular polish to dry and they would chip in a day or two anyway.  I have already orderd a few more colors and I am so happy that I can have nice looking nails again.</li>
            <li> Feel the product is old...have purchased new kit from beauty supply store --works much better.  With any of these products don&#x27;t put on heavy coat.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for almost 3 years. I have tried a few different brands and always find myself coming back to Gelish. It lasts longer than other brands I’ve tried and is a great price. Doing your own gel nails has a bit of a learning curve. I’m guessing you’re looking at this set because you’re wanting to try it out. I’ll say off the bat that Gelish is great. This kit gives you nearly everything you need to get started (minus a light and color). The mini bottles last long enough to get you through more 20 manicures in my experience, so for $1-2 a manicure, this is a wonderful deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the basic steps to doing your own manicure:&lt;br /&gt;1. File and clip nails to your desired length. If you plan on leaving the polish on for 2 weeks, go slightly shorter since they will grow quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2. Buff the nails well. Especially the creases and up by the cuticile. I like using a buffer block, it gets in the creases better. If the nail is still smooth and shiny it will probably lift early.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash hands and allow to dry fully. Moisture in the nails will be trapped by the polish and shorten the life of your manicure.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use cleaner in lint free wipe to clean nail. I use an alcohol pad for this step.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use the pH bond. It’s thin and watery. It takes about 30 seconds to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply foundation. This is the thickest of all the polish. Make sure not to get any on the skin, if you do use the stick to wipe it off before curing! Cap the nail, meaning put a little polish on the edge.&lt;br /&gt;7. Cure under light for the required amount of time. It’s 5 seconds with my Gelish light.&lt;br /&gt;8. Paint a coat of color, putting some the edge. Again, make sure not to get any on the nail or cuticle, but get as close as you can.&lt;br /&gt;9. Cure for required amount of time. Mine is 20-30 seconds. Paint another coat, cure again. Do this until you have the coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;10. Apply top coat. This is the one that is the thinnest. I used  to always get it pooled in the creases between my skin because I put too much on. Wipe the brush off well and apply a thin coat.&lt;br /&gt;11. Cure under light. Its 30 seconds with the Gelish light.&lt;br /&gt;12. Wipe down with either alcohol wipe or the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to save you a little time, here are a few things I learned over the years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Practice: Practice makes perfect. Don’t get discouraged if your first few manicures turn out bad. I took pictures of my first couple and they look pretty horrid. There’s polish pooled on the sides, my cuticles are covered in polish, the layers are uneven. Now my friends are amazed that my nails I did at home look as good as theirs that they spend a lot of money on. Doing my right hand took quite some time, but now I’ve developed great fine motor control and it looks perfect. Practicing on friends or fake nails is a great also. I have fake nails I use to practice designs on.&lt;br /&gt;• LED: I initially bought a UV light that fit both hands for about $50, I used it for over 2 years. I recently bought a Gelish LED light for about $200. I’m so mad I didn’t buy it earlier. Yes, it is expensive, but compared to my friends who get their manicures at a salon for $30+ it’s absolutely worth it. Say I do my nails every 2 weeks for 2 years, that’s 52 manicures. At $30 a piece, which is a very conservative estimate, that’s $1,560 in manicures. I do Gelish pedicures on myself as well, so that increases the savings by a lot. Spend the extra money to get a nice light! I’ve invested about $400 in my gel nails with the lights, a variety of colors and a couple sets of Gelish top/base coat. It’s been worth every penny. I can do my base coat in 5 seconds and other coats in 30 seconds. I also experiment around more with designs now since the process is so quick. I also don’t mind fixing just one nail since it only takes a couple minutes with the LED.&lt;br /&gt;• Prep: Your manicure will only be as goodas the prep you do on your nail. This includes taking off all the old polish, filing the nails to a nice length (they will grow over 2 weeks so go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well. I used  to not prep my nails good enough and  that was another reason they weren’t lasting as long as they should.&lt;br /&gt;• Time: Set aside a big block of time to do it, rushing through will not give you the nice finished product you want. Make sure you’re comfortable with your painting elbow supported. Find a good TV show or put on some music. Make sure all your supplies are handy, including some paper towels and the sticks to get in the cracks. Don’t do it after drinking a ton of coffee (made that mistake and was too jittery).&lt;br /&gt;• Cap the edges: This is one part of the whole process that it took me awhile to appreciate. I never knew why my nails lifted at the tips so quickly. I wasn’t putting polish on the free edge and as I did tasks the gel at the edge slowly started lifting. When you put a little polish on the edge it seals it. I do this by painting a nail, when I’m done with that nail my brush doesn’t have much polish on it. I run it along the edge, since it doesn’t have much polish it’s a thin later, then I redip it in the bottle and finish that nail I just “capped”. This prevents me from having a bulge at the tip, like you get if you cap the nail after painting it.&lt;br /&gt;• Complete kit versus basics: This kit has more products than you absolutely need. Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off. The bottle of &amp;#34;artificial nail remover&amp;#34; is the same (or similar) to acetone remover, the bottle of &amp;#34;Nail surface cleanse&amp;#34; can be substituted with 70% alcohol wipes and the &amp;#34;Nourish&amp;#34; cuticle oil I’ve never used. This kit has it all and some basic tools .There are Gelish kits for the same price minus all the extras that have full size bottles. I do like the mini bottles because it gets replaced before it ever gets old.&lt;br /&gt;• Watch your skin: Pick up a wood stick (a toothpick could probably work) and get everything off your skin and cuticle prior to curing. This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration. Anywhere the polish touches the skin is where it will lift and drive you crazy. When I was using my UV light I did both hands at the same time to save money. It was very hard to get my skin clean and not mess up the paint. I find it much easier now that I do one hand at a time.&lt;br /&gt;• Think thin: Thin layers are best. It’s hard to do at first, but it’s better to do 3-4 coats of thin polish rather than 2 coats of thick polish. This will prevent the excess from dripping in the creases, make it cure better and make it look better.&lt;br /&gt;• Commitment: Once you get started you will be addicted. I feel like I have to have gel polish on at all times now. Before this my nails were short and ugly. I bit them, peeled them and they weren’t cute at all. Now they are medium length and always kept up beautifully. If I take my polish off and even go a day without it my nails chip and are horrible. Between taking the old nails off and redoing them it’s about an 1 ½ to 2 hour process. I do it about every week and a half religiously. It’s sometimes annoying, but the end result makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now got to the point where I have started experimenting with nail art and do some of my friends nails. I gave away my UV light to a friend, got her hooked on them and now she bought the Gelish light. This kit is a great way to try it out without a huge commitment. Although I do love my Gelish light, there are smaller, cheaper ones out there if you’re not sure you want spend that much upfront. I do recommend LED though, for health reasons and because it’s so much faster. If you have any questions feel free to ask.as the prep you do on your nail. This includes taking off all the old polish, filing the nails to a nice length (they will grow over 2 weeks so go slightly shorter than you want), a good buffing and letting your nails dry well.

            <li> This product is a great starter kit. It has everything you need, except the light, to give yourself a nice clear manicured nails. The price is great and the company sent this product in a very timely manner. FYI Sally&#x27;s is advertising this product this week in their circular for double the price. Plus you must be a member to purchase from them. Good Luck using this product and happy nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  The top coat makes your nail so super shiny.  The only thing I was a bit diappointed in that the bottles are so super tiny.  Wish they were just a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product!!! It lasts for at least two weeks with no chipping. Very simple to use, and much cheaper than getting your nails done at a salon. I would recommend this to everyone!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I have always had weak, split nails. Polish would chip within hours of applying. I used to do acrylics but that just ruined my already bad nails. I am into the third week of just foundation and top coat. I have done dishes every night, cleaned two bathrooms and general housekeeping. Can&#x27;t believe that they are still so shiny with no chips, just growth. When I first used the gelish four weeks ago the nails were just to the top of my finger. I now have at least an 1/8 inch growth. YAY!!!! We did have trouble curing the color gel with the LED lamp but I don&#x27;t even care about that. I have nails that are long, strong and flexible. I will continue using the gel on my nails, foundation and top just because it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I am happy that someone made this polish available for the diy girl.  It will make your fingernails \\&quot;shine like justice\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to do my nails because most of the reviews I read stated that this manicure will last up to three weeks.  Every other nail polish (even ones that stated they last at least a week) only last on me up to 3 days then the polish peeled off.  I have very weak nails and one that constantly splits.  Although I was hesitant to spend so much money on nail polish and also have to buy a UV lamp to cure the Gelish, I did it anyway thinking that if this product works, it will be well worth it.  And it is.  So I must tell you, I LOVE Harmony Gelish due to the fact that it lasted on my fingernails around 12 days with no chipping, peeling or nail breakage.  I did purchase the clear Structure Gel also to help strengthen my nails and let me tell you it sure works.  My nails are growing so I will be able to do a French Manicure when I do my nails next.  (That will be my third manicure).  This product has lasted 4 weeks on my toes so far.  Also, I do my Mom&#x27;s nails.  Her&#x27;s never grow due to constant splitting and breaking.  Her manicure has lasted over three weeks and her nails are growing nicely.  Make sure you follow the instructions exactly and your manicure will last.  You can do a Google search for Harmony Gelish Application.  There are a bunch of videos out there that show you how to apply this product.  The first time I did my nails it took me two hours.  The next time it took 1.5 hours so I am hoping that the third time only takes 1 hour.  However, it is well worth spending the time to do the manicure correctly.  Oh yes, make sure you wipe any product off of your skin before curing in the UV or LED light.  If you don&#x27;t, your nails will probably peel.  The only negative I have to say about Harmony Gelish is that the colors that I have bought so far as MUCH lighter than pictured in the advertisement or all together wrong.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake I made at first by not reading the reviews of the colors.  I am expecting three more colors soon.  I ordered darker colors than I would normally order with the hope that they actually turn out lighter than the color on the computer.</li>
            <li> As close to professional as it gets. I was trying to save money on gel polish manicures @$30 per mani. With one at home manicure I have already gotten my moneys worth. I have done 4 manicures so far on myself saving a total of $90 so far and my kit is not even close to being empty.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The word \\&quot;mini\\&quot; does mean mini, so you will only get 2 treatments out of the foundation and top coat.</li>
            <li> I can finally have nails without getting acrylics!  I was a nail bitter for a very long time.  I recently stopped and have struggled with my nails looking nice.  I felt like I might as well bite them since they don&#x27;t look nice anyway.  If my nails were exposed to water for any length of time they would just tear or bend and break.  Even with nail strengthner polish they just couldn&#x27;t hold up to my daily wear and tear.  The gellish lets me have nails longer then I could ever achieve.  Now I can have all my nails the same length so they all look consistant.  So easy to apply, the first time I used to much product and it will \\&quot;pool\\&quot; around the cuticle when under the UV.  Use very thin coats.  The product is still flexible when cured.  I am very happy with Gelish.  I am a DIY&#x27;er, I do my own toenails with a french and understand that not all people have time of patience for that, but the gelish system is very easy, very fast.  Just be sure to follow the directions and use very little product.  Don&#x27;t worry if you see brush strokes, they even out and disipate when under the UV.</li>
            <li> I bought these with USpicy Macaron UUSND-3603 Professional UV Acrylic Gel light.  I can do my nails when I want (around 14 days) and the results are great.</li>
            <li> The Gelish mini kit is terrific.  I am getting used to using it and getting that nice gel polish finish on my nails.  Found a lamp that works well now...first one I got &#x27;blew up&#x27; the 2nd time I went to turn it on.  This kit is terrific for me and I just need to find the right color gel and I will be all set now.</li>
            <li> The products are about half the size of a bottle of nail polish but you use so little that it will last a long time.  It is nice to have all the products that you need in one kit.  If you want color you will a have to buy is separately.</li>
            <li> been using this as a first timer it works good and love it... the gel polish remover works fast when you have to take it off..time frame is right when using the LED.</li>
            <li> i love the gelish system and in fact i only use gelish for my manicures. i bought this kit when i started out with gelish. however, looking back i should have listened to the reviewers and only bought the full size foundation and top coat and the colors i wanted. you can buy everything else at your local drugstore (i.e., alcohol, acetone, cuticle oil). it works just as well and is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions included with the product other than the basic guide on the back of the box. (Colors are not included.) A quick Google search will provide useful info on how to apply. The timing guide on the box for the curing process is helpful and includes a variety of lamp strengths. The foundation and top it off gels are very thick and hard to manage to apply a thin coat. I usually do not wear a color, and wearing the top it off coat as clear is pretty. Dark colors are especially difficult to learn to apply without getting the color under the cuticle. And the color seems to contract or move on the nail before curing. I always need two coats to fill in the edges of the nails where the color has shifted. Another note about buying color gel is that the color on the bottle is NEVER close to what the finished color will look like. Gelish needs to do a better job with this. With proper nail prep, I have been able to go a week with no chipping. My nails grow quickly and leave noticeable growth; going two weeks would look really bad because of the growth although the polish has not chipped. What I like about the product is that when you are finished with the last step, you could literally go wash dishes. When it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. And my nails seem stronger with the gel.</li>
            <li> This kit works well with other Gel nail polish products. My friend and I have had several applications from one kit so far.  Buying an extra bottle of remover and cotton maybe helpful if you are snowed in like us!. The other ladies bring their own baggie of orange-sticks. We had other  co-workers at break time getting their nails done and there is still more product to use.  So fast, so easy once you get the hang of it. We can apply the process on each other in case we smudge a bit. We line up the kit so it is easy to grab, loosen caps if alone, or in a rush like us. Done in 15mins.!! (Kept the boxes to transport) Ready for work again and totally dry. We soak off polish at home since that takes too long for break time. All kinds of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Overall Startup cost for all pieces/machine were a lot for me because I wanted to buy a moderately priced machine.  My friend has a $20.00 machine and LOVES hers as well. But in comparison with some prices,  this GELISH Basix Kit and price is excellent and works just great to get started.  I will buy another one this week.  KT</li>
            <li> Gelish is right.  Not Gel but Gelish.  If you are good with polishing and filing your own nails, then this is just o.k.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for awhile now and I still have not run out of anything yet, and I do my nails every 3 weeks. It&#x27;s great and I love it!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this kit.  I&#x27;ve seen it for $45+ in stores.  I have been doing my own gel nails for over a year now and I tell anyone who is thinking about buying this kit and a UV lamp to GO FOR IT! Yes, it seems a little expensive at first, but this whole system (polishes included) pays for itself after a few uses! Great product/price.</li>
            <li> this product just peels off my finger it is a waste of money ...i advice every1 not to buy this product..it i could i would have not given them a star at all..</li>
            <li> so easy and it doesn&#x27;t take any time at all. love the oil i use that in between to nourish nails. Loved the file ti came with too</li>
            <li> Happy with the starter kit and good bargain compared to what local beauty store was charging for it.  Wish the bottles of Nail Cleaner and Acetone were a little bigger, but that is the easier and less expensive product to replace.  Overall prompt and fast service from vendor.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit locally, for $20 more than Amazon wants for it. It was still a good deal. I got my nails done with gelish at the (cheap) salon for $25 plus tip-I will make my money back for this kit and the light within 3 times of doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I did my own gel nails, and they look as good as they did at the salon. They look much better than when I do my own nails with normal polish, because you can wipe off the mistakes before curing and it&#x27;s like they never happened. I can tell my nails will look even better after doing this a few times, but they look amazing even after my first try. They&#x27;re very strong, shiny, cure well, and are pretty easy to use-I didn&#x27;t even watch the DVD tutorial, but I will. Great product!</li>
            <li> First time using it, and it okay.  Does not stay on as long as I thought it would.  It&lt;br /&gt;is good for a week and you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Bond &#x3D;alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser &#x3D; acetone mix &#x3D; nail polish remover&lt;br /&gt;Remover &#x3D; acetone&lt;br /&gt;Nourish&#x3D; cuticle oil&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper to buy the generic items.  The foundation is an awesome ridge filler. The top it off is probably polyurethane but not sure, top it off works well,but the brush needs soaked in acetone to get the hardened stuff off.  I hope this helps you save money. The beauty industry seems to really gouge the prices. .</li>
            <li> I have attempted to use this kit twice but the foundation just simply will not dry (even with a nail dryer). I threw it away today. A waster of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size of these mini gels! I&#x27;ve been using these almost every week for almost a year and still using it. Great kit for a great price.</li>
            <li> I am basing this review simply on the fact that there are NO directions. How is one supposed to know how to use this stuff? There are 6 bottles of chemicals. If you are a trained professional you would be buying a professional set not this. This set is clearly for do it yourself at home so it really needs directions! I was so excited to get this but now that it&#x27;s arrived I&#x27;m very disappointed and nervous to just start using products that I have no clue how to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Little tip if you get fine glitter and mix it with a little top coat you can do French manicures that look amazing. It works great. I stole the idea from my nail lady</li>
            <li> Not a lot for what you pay for and the bottle were very small. Would not try this is you are a beginner.</li>
            <li> For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon. The product is a great product with a great price. The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set!&lt;br /&gt;Needs step by step instructions and tips like use very dry brush not thick layers&lt;br /&gt;and do more than one coat if necessary. Another tip is go beyond the end of the nail as the polish shrinks slightly and can leave the tip of the nail uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would like to see alcohol wipes added to this kit!  Even if just a couple to let the novice know that this is the final step to dry the polish!</li>
            <li> Does not come with instructions so I watched the Gelish tutorial on Youtube. Loving the results!</li>
            <li> I was having issues getting my gel polishes to last. They always seemed to peal off with in a day or two. Not anymore, this kit makes my nail polish last almost two weeks. I usually grow tired of the color long before it comes off</li>
            <li> Lasts okay but nothing like getting professionally done.  I use when I can&#x27;t get to the salon.  Easy to use.  Would be great for a teenager also.</li>
            <li> GELISH Products are  GREAT !  Highly recommend : )&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;My gel manicure lasts longer than when I paid $40 at a nail salon !&lt;br /&gt;I bought the MelodySusie 2013 Upgrades 12W Violetili LED Lamp Gel Nail Dryer to go with.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)     The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application    AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application [...]  1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand,flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.  7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.  d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!  e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  TECH TIPS:  [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.  **I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]  **clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do. **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking. **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.  **  [...]    TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  *****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out. Would recommend highly recommend.    BEAUTY~NAILS~GEL-JULY 2012  **VIDEO:  [...]</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish and this was the first brand I used. There are a lot more gels on the market now, but this is still one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best kits out there.  it is very easy to use and my nails look wonderful.The best part is I have saved $$$$ and not had to wait at the salon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Still using this original kit after 10 months of doing my own gel nails.  Lasts a long time!  I like the Gelish brand of polish best.</li>
            <li> First set I got when I bought my light so don&#x27;t. Have any experience with any other type yet but I do like it, seems to work good.  Oh and today I found out you can&#x27;t do your nails outside, the suns uv rays dry the brushs out.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product once. I used BMC color with it. The color was runny and did not adhere as a thin coat, so I had to use 2 coats. It may work better with Gelish nail color.</li>
            <li> This kit contained everything I needed as I was traveling &amp; couldn&#x27;t  pack all of the necessary bottles for my nails. I had a UV light at the final destination.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to try. The mini bottles works great for travel. The products are easy to use, and directions are very clear. I would recommend this product if you are interested in at home gel nails. Thank you .</li>
            <li> For the starter who wants to see if they like to do this at home this is a wonderful little set. Includes all the basics and sets you right on tract to beautiful gel manicure. Just buy the color and lamp and you are set! Definitely recommend! Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> enjoying this product.  thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased with UV gel nail dryer for my nails that are very thin, break  and split easily. I had been going to a nail salon and did not want to pay $30 every 2 weeks to keep my nails looking nice. This starter kit was great and I have been very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This has everything you need to practice using gel. Takes a bit of practice but it definitely works, instructions are lacking</li>
            <li> I liked the kit very much and it has lasted and looks just like my nails were done at a salon!  I used with a Royal UV dryer I bought on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Complete package with all necessary items need to do my nails.  Products were excellent and easy to use.  My nails turned out great!</li>
            <li> Great shipping time, but when I received it my box was smooshed and two of my bottles &amp;#34;top it off, and pH bond&amp;#34; were busted and all over everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price! Delivery was actually a day earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Great kit! Best I have used.  It actually lasts the 2 weeks!! I had a problem with my gel nails lifting but with this product they do not.</li>
            <li> The kit has everything you need.  The only complaint is there were no instructions and the words on the bottle were TINY...there was no way I was able to read them and I have good eye sight.  So I looked up a youtube video on how to apply gel manicures so I know what to do.  I have used it twice so far and thus far, its good.  I do wonder how many applications I can get out of these little bottles.  I will update once I know-- it will be approximate of course, but to give an idea.</li>
            <li> super size for travel . Went on vacation for 3 weeks and was able to keep my manicure beautiful. small size makes it easy to pack . I just use my mini size curing lamp to dry mails.</li>
            <li> Very good product for geling your nails. I advise getting the different nail polish remover the one in this box did work very well. I ended up picking and digging the polish off.</li>
            <li> Great gel polish!  Don&#x27;t forget that you need a gel cure light, not included.  If you run out of last step top cure liquid you can use rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> The item&#x27;s product box was crushed on one side.  The outside shipping box was intact but smelled very nice inside, like a musky/minty perfume.  I found the cause when I opened the product box, the ph bond bottle had opened and spilled its contents throughout.  Very disappointed because someone packed this crushed/oily/smelling box in a shipping box and sent it out!  Poor quality control for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with it.  Everything was packaged nicely and I got it before the date I was supposed too which was nice. The artificial nail remover can also remove gelish polish and so can acetone either one is fine I have used the artificial nail remover so far and it has worked great!</li>
            <li> I bought this size for my teen and its perfect! She gets very creative with her nails and it is so much cheaper than taking her to the salon.</li>
            <li> Works well can be over price depending on where you buy it but good product honestly all you really need is the top coat ;) lol if you want a high uv shine</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price was very reasonable.  It is so much better and easier and quicker than regular polish.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and still had some mixed feelings but gave it a try anyway. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!! Now I can get no chip mani at home after my baby goes to sleep. The package didn&#x27;t give me clear directions but I followed youtube tutorial, many ppl skip the phbond so I did the same thing couple of times but using the phbond makes a difference.  Also you have to purchase the nail polish sepertly but looking at the colors on line is totally different then going to the beauty store like Sally&#x27;s.  I ordered a red color online but when it arrived it was more pink. So excited to use this kit again and again.</li>
            <li> I like the product!! I like that they made smaller ones so that u could try it..  It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> good bang for the buck..but even after watching the dvd and following the explict instructions.it doesnt last more than 2-3 days before literally peeling off of my nail. Even sought out help from my nail salon; after going through the same steps they do and the same brand light...i cant get my polish to last. Kind of disappointing since i did this to save money....</li>
            <li> This set is a dream. For starters, I&#x27;d like to mention that a set of gel nails at any salon where I live is $35-$40. I have never seen one for less. So, you may look at the price of this kit or the refills and cringe. But it pays for itself AND it looks as good as if someone certified is doing them. I&#x27;d also like to mention that the best place to get the gelish colors is here on amazon. Sally&#x27;s is the only place where I live that sells their stuff, and they carry way fewer colors and they only sell the tiny .5 oz bottle, like the size that comes in this kit. You&#x27;ll get double the product, better price, and possibly a shade that you can&#x27;t just go buy! This stuff feels so good. I can&#x27;t stop feeling how smooth my nails are. Regular polish is a thing of the past for me. I&#x27;m an owner of thin nails that tear off constantly and for my 21 years I&#x27;ve NEVER had feminine, long, healthy nails. This system promises to deliver that, and I&#x27;m so excited. However, you can save a bit of money after using up the trial sizes. Like I said, get all your refills from amazon. Also, the nail cleanse is just blue isopropyl alcohol. I used both on the same set and got perfect results from both. The cuticle oil isn&#x27;t a must-have either, so once you use it it&#x27;s really not necessary to buy more unless you just like using it. And the artificial nail remover? It&#x27;s acetone. But be warned-dollar stores sell \\&quot;100% acetone nail polish remover\\&quot; but it&#x27;s very diluted and weak...I have used it in the past and it barely takes off regular nail polish. (What hasn&#x27;t chipped off by that point!) You need professional grade 100% acetone from either wal mart or Sally&#x27;s but don&#x27;t worry; it&#x27;s a very cheap purchase. Pair it with cotton balls and foil and that saves money for the removal process because Gelish and other Shellac brands have developed their own removal kits that I&#x27;m sure are nice, but who has money for all the extras these days? The cotton ball method is cheap and very easy. BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW: a good light (uv or led, it&#x27;s all about your preference) is important. I had initially bought the 9 watt gelish mini light and it is absolute garbage. It wouldn&#x27;t cure any of the steps no matter how long I used it. I now use a 54 watt by Royal Nails and it really ties this whole kit together. I regret not investing in one sooner. I hope my review helps anyone out who is skeptical....it&#x27;s so worth it for the DIY girly girl. Comment if you have any questions or advice. Good luck!

            <li> I bought this as a gift so I have not used it, but the same kit was at Sally Beauty for double the price- that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I am a professional manicurist and this starter kit is great because of the cost.  Never having applied gel nails before, and learning how, this product is easy to apply and my customers love it!  Lasts a long time and your nails will stay shiny and beautiful for 2 weeks.  Very good price from this seller.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> and this was a great little starter kit. the stickers help in getting the white tip just so. Great for beginners</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that I could save myself money and not have to go to the salon. My significant other bought me an LED light for Christmas that only takes 45 seconds to cure plus a cute pink gel nail polish. I set myself up and did the manicure. So far no chips, no peeling, no dents and its been over a week. Everything I could have hoped for. Just follow the steps and DO NOT get the Foundation or the Top Coat on your skin! If you do, during curing it will BURN. Depending on how sensitive your skin is, it might be painful or just feel like a burning sensation. I think Gelish made this kit perfectly for the average person. Just do thin coats of Foundation and Top Coat and make sure to clean and prep your nails prior to doing this. If you do white tips, get STRONG ones. I used cheap ones and all they did was break off and take the gel polish with it.</li>
            <li> I wish this basic kit came with a polish color, but otherwise it works out great!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great set for gel nails. I bought it as I had just decided to start doing my nails with gel. Great set. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package I was surprised to find that the gelish Ph bond bottle was completely empty.  From the box it is obvious it did not drain out during shipping but that I was shipped an empty bottle.  I am disappointed to have paid for a product and not received it.  I used the rest of the set and it worked well.  Just wish I would have received the whole set.</li>
            <li> very good product, durable, and for natural nails. takes about an hour to soak off though, but better than CND and not watery at all.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of the foundation that came out really clumpy and there was no way to get it to go on nicely. I wrote a note to the company and never heard anything back. I went back on and they had no longer been listed on the product at all. I have found that the OPI set comes in a larger amount and works better. This stuff works after getting a new bottle of the foundation from Sally B. The opi goes on smoother and for me has lasted longer on the nails.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product on the 7th &amp; it arrived on 14th. Love this product. Its the same stuff salons use. I also ordered the Gelish Structure,which is pretty much the same thing as the Foundation but its much thicker. I can&#x27;t wait to try the Hard Gelish.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and brand new (still in packaging with plastic wrap)! I love this brand&#x27;s top quality for a fraction of the cost in stores.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal because it gave you everything you needed to be able to do a gel manicure/pedicure at home without purchasing each item individually at a much higher cost. It is also helpful because for a beginner, it made sure I had everything I needed to be successful at doing this at home.You have to follow all the steps and directions or it doesn&#x27;t turn out right. The very last thing you do is wipe the nail off with a little nail remover/cleaner on a cotton ball. If you do not do this, it will feel sticky. After you do that last thing, they are shiny, and no longer sticky. Read tips and tricks online and you will be able to do this at home.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated by the size of the bottles but trust me, you can get a ton of manicures out of this amazing set!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  It took longer to receive it than expected.</li>
            <li> Works ok but probably will go back to the nail salon was not really what I expected.  Only holds up for a few days and then it begins to peel.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with my purchase! This was my first time using Gelish or any other comparable item on the market. I did a lot of research before deciding and found this item on Amazon priced much better than local retailers, so I gave it a shot. So happy I did!</li>
            <li> It worked fine , its more so for a person that has alot of time. I think investing in rhe larger lamp and gel polish, for people on the go it would serfice.</li>
            <li> Item came very quickly . Although box came factory sealed, one of the bottles (top it off) inside was open and leaked all over. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it when I did my nails. My nails where unbelievably shinny and chip free for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to trying out my Gelish kit, but when I got it in the mail, the envelope itself smelled VERY strongly of acetone. Something had clearly broken inside the envelope. I couldn&#x27;t even leave it in my apartment to mail the next day, it smelled so strong -- I had to immediately print out the return label and run to the mailbox to get rid of the offending smell. Blech! This really should have been shipped in a box instead of an envelope!</li>
            <li> I new to gel polish and found that I love Gelish. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> For a first time buyer, this kit is great. Good way to invest small amount and get what you need. The videos on You tube are helpful too.</li>
            <li> I think it is pretty good brand to use. however, it does peel off. not every nail but enough to re-do them just after 2-3 days after applying original coats. what I like about it is that I can grow my own nails long because the gel hardens them enough to withstand all the dishwashing and house cleaning and lotion applying. and although, it is a MINI size, I&#x27;ve used it quite a few time now. definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner,easy to use, lasts long on nails.</li>
            <li> Great kit, cheaper priced than most beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> So far this kit has done a great job, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as in the salon, but it might be me. I have only done it a couple of times, so I may need to practice a little more.</li>
            <li> All was great with product and I have used these products before. My kit was unopened but it was missing a bottle of Top It Off and there is no way to send product back due to return policy on returning chemicals. I went and purchased a bottle of the missing item at a local Sally&#x27;s so I can use the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  Thanks so much for quick and great service.  Love this product and works just like in the salons.</li>
            <li> Great. Easy to work with. Hardly any smell, not like the smell in a nail shop.&lt;br /&gt;Have to get more colors.</li>
            <li> Good value and fast shipping.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great starter kit.  This did not include an instruction sheet but I was able to watch a you tube video.</li>
            <li> You would be better off buying bigger bottles of the starter kit. It does NOT come with any colors, just the PH bond, base coat, and top it off. They are the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; bottles, so you will get a decent amount but for the price you can by the .5 ml bottles.</li>
            <li> Gave 2 for Christmas gifts along with lights. Both ladies were happy to have something to use to do their nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit for those of you out there who are considering the idea of doing your own gel manicures! I bought this kit and it has everything in it you need to do a gel manicure, just choose a nice Harmony gel nail color to go along with it! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I started using Gelish three months ago. I have weak, paper thin nails. Often a crack on the side of a nail becomes a painful problem. The Gelish coating protects and strengthens the nail bed. I work with my hands but I love a great manicure. Great price for the Basix Kit.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this kit!  Since it didn&#x27;t come with color gel, I ordered Princess and Sleek White in order to do a French manicure.  I had my daughter-n-law do my nails for me.  We were both impressed at how easy it was!  My nails looked as if I had just been to the salon!  Everything arrived as it should.  My kit did not come with any instructions, but I went to youtube and we learned from that as to how to do this.  We really liked the fact that the base coat (princess) went on first-then under the lamp for 120 secs. Then we put on the sleek white polish.  Using non-acetone nail polish remover, with an artist paint brush (we highly recommend a quality paint brush as little hairs can cause issues from other types of brushes--especially those designed for make-up!) we were easily able to shape the smile for the french tips.  It removed just the white polish very easily!  Then under the lamp for another 120 secs (we used a 36 watt UV curing lamp) We followed this with the top coat (included in the kit) and left it under the lamp for 180 secs.  (my lamp has two different timer settings)  Using lint-free nail wipes we used the nail surface cleanse (also included in kit) to wipe the nails clean. You can also use alcohol once you run out of this cleanse.  You end up with professional looking nails when you are finished.  One more tip--be sure to clean any polish off your skin before curing.  We used the non-acetone polish remover to do this as it can&#x27;t remove the polish below that has already been cured. Below are the steps we used:  1. buff nails and shape nails  2. Paint nails with the pH bond  3. Paint nails with the foundation  4. cure under lamp for 120 sec. (If someone is helping you, while one hand was under the lamp, the other hand can be painted.  5. Paint on your base color (Princess, bashful etc.)  6. Cure 120 sec. under lamp  7. Add Sleek White for the french tips (we did 2 coats curing between the coats) .  8. With an artist brush and non acetone polish remover, form the \\&quot;smile\\&quot; for the French tips. Take your time with the first coat and get it exactly how you want it.  The second coat will be easier because you now have something to follow.  9. Cure under lamp for 120 sec. (remember--do this with each coat)  10. Paint on the Top if Off Sealer  11. Cure under lamp for 180 secs to make sure it is well cured.  12. Using a lint free nail wipe, clean nails with the Nail Surface Cleanse.  This removes the tackiness leaving you with beautiful smooth, sleek, shiny nails!  Your beautiful nails should last several weeks.  This is only day two for me and already I am impressed because a typical French manicure using regular polish will only last me a day before it starts chipping off. If I can get a week I will be pleased!  I gave this 4 stars because I think they should include directions.</li>
            <li> I received my basix kit and was somewhat disappointed, there was a leak in a bottle but not enough to send it back, I tried and the instructions were so small it made it difficult to read not only did I have to use my reading glasses I had to use a really good magnifying glass. I managed to do my left hand and it didn&#x27;t seem to cure even with my uv light. I am not sure I will keep either one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this starter kit thinking the bottles were full size, however they are not.&lt;br /&gt;The products work well, but I probable didn&#x27;t need all of them.[[ASIN:B0081SGUC0 Harmony Gelish Mini Basix Kit]]</li>
            <li> I bought this as a starter kit, my first time using shellac nail polish. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, in conjunction with a UV light [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] and Gelish Magneto Polish [[ASIN:B00762XOA8 Harmony Gelish Magneto - Electric Metal Lover .5 Oz. W/free Matching Magnet Lacquer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottles are small, as described, but a great starter kit for people like me that had no idea what I needed to start polishing my nails with shellac/gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it took more time than instructed under the light to cure polish (and other layers). Not necessarily true. The polish is generally tacky until you finish with the Nail Surface Cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints/observations are these:&lt;br /&gt;The base coat (foundation) is way to thick, stringy, gooey. Is it old and dried up?&lt;br /&gt;The pH Bond is basically rubbing alcohol in a nail polish bottle. No need to repurchase when gone. Just refill at home.&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish Remover is basically acetone, a.k.a. nail polish remover. Again, no need to repurchase through Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish Nourish is just cuticle oil. I haven&#x27;t compare prices, but my guess is that you can buy at a drug store for less.</li>
            <li> Love Gelish so far! Even though the bottles are small in the starter kit, it&#x27;s good to have all the pieces when first learning how to do your own gel nails, makes it easier to follow all the steps. Also they will definitely last a while even though they are small, except maybe the polish remover. I&#x27;ve done my nails twice so far and kept the colors on about 2 weeks, but could have left on longer because no chipping at all or color fading (at least with the glitter polish I used). I just can&#x27;t believe how shiny the polish stays for so long, it&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want to worry about having your hands in water doing dishes or whatever, the polish stays on!</li>
            <li> this polish is so easy to use &amp; it looks great</li>
            <li> Package arrived early in perfect condition. Perfect! Great job!</li>
            <li> If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is easy.  A great system if you can afford a decent 36V UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that I only recommend the Gelish system for people who can paint their nails, with traditional polish, if they can paint neatly.  If you are a sloppy nail painter I do not recommend any gel system, as it is unforgiving one you &#x60;cook&#x27; the polish under the UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EACH PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BASE COAT AND TOP COAT&lt;br /&gt;The base coat and top coat are what I would consider the only required products in the set.  The ingredients are nearly the same.  On the box they are EXACTLY the same but on the Amazon product info they vary slightly.  The base coat is thicker and the top coat leaves a slightly higher shine. So if you run out of one, and are in a pinch, you can just use one of the products.  I did so successfully on 2 occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GELISH PH BOND&lt;br /&gt;Although not required for the system, it does help people that have a nail chemistry that resists keeping on polish.  So if regular polish starts to chip on you, within the first day or two, your nail chemistry will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal nail chemistry makes it hard for me to keep on even salon applied solar gel nails on for more than a few days.  Gelish nail product does last me about 5 days with minimal micro chips; this is a long time for me.  Once I do dishes thought they are ruined since I don&#x27;t use any dish gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GELISH NOURISH&lt;br /&gt;This is a similar product put on every time I have ever gone to get a salon manicure.  It is helpful to keep cuticles from drying out and maintain a healthy (and healtly looking) cuticle.  I find this important more so when using this Gelish system since the gel does dry hard and can irritate cuticle when placed slightly on top of cuticle; and the UV light is a little harsh on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GELISH CLENSER&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for wiping of the tacky residue.  I use it after base coat and top coat.  Be sure to use a lint free cloth.  I recommend, to save some money, purchasing some non-acetone polish remover in its place.  Non-acetone remover removed my fear of degrading the chemical process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GELISH REMOVER&lt;br /&gt;This product works as described. Just soak your nails in product for 30 seconds and remove.  I do have to kind of scrape off the product.  A more economical replacement is just buying a bottle of pure acetone.  It does the trick.</li>
            <li> The best product that I use to my nails</li>
            <li> it works like their sir post to work</li>
            <li> Gelish is my favorite soak of polish kit! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> First, read A. Crafton&#x27;s review.  Then buy your kit, a light and lint free wipes.  I bought the Thermal Spa 49135 light and love it.  Buy a color as well.  Start with a pale one so mistakes show less as you practice this.  I bought Need a Tan and just got Bashful yesterday.  Need a Tan is similar to Caucasian flesh tone and Bashful is a very pale pink with very slight sparkles.  Both are perfect for the professional environment. I also got a bottle of plain acetone at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and a bottle of non-acetone polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keys I have found is put the polich on very thin.  Never let it touch your cuticles as it will peel up in that spot.  Get a good \\&quot;cap\\&quot; on the ends of the nails, even if it gets on the skin of your finger tips- that will peel off without effect.  2 minutes in the thermal spa to cure is plenty.  If the polish starts to peel at the edges or back, just use a nail clipper to clip it off.  To remove, soak in a small amuont of acetone for 10-15 minutes and use a tool to scrape it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool thing is that you can put regular polish on over the Gelish (one coat is plenty) and take it off with the non-acetone remover with no effect whatsoever on the Gelish.  Amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes an hour or so to take off the old Gelish and put on a new coat.  And It only takes 4-5 times to pay for itself.  My manicures last 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just got this last night.  Used with the 36w UV light.  My only issue was there were no directions included or written on the outside of the box.  However, a quick internet search and I found the directions on the Harmony Gelish website.  Highly recommend.  I bought the french manicure polish (sleek white and simple sheer).  Looks great.  A little time consuming the first time, but once you know all the steps, pretty quick.  But hey, if it lasts 3 weeks, no problem!  So far, my nails look great.  Usually after only hours, my nail polish chips and looks terrible by day 2.  So far, looks like I just stepped out of the salon.  Whoohoo!</li>
            <li> Ive used the more expensive CND shellac and this is just as good if not better. I actually think it lasts longer than the shellac. Why I would get this one over shellac:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper&lt;br /&gt;2. More colors (better colors)&lt;br /&gt;3. Their is a nourish step that makes cuticles feel healthy&lt;br /&gt;4. There is a dehydration step that seems to make these last longer&lt;br /&gt;Love this system...just wish I had a Led light instead of a UV so it would be faster to do.</li>
            <li> This basic starter kit is just that, gets you started.  It&#x27;s great for anyone wanting to start doing their own nails at home but there are a few cons.  There is no color polish included in the kit.  The bottles are literally mini and there are no instructions on how to use the polish (i.e. what order and how long to cure each one) but once u figure that out they work as advertised.  I was able to figure out the proper order online by watching some YouTube videos and will share with you below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: pH Bond (nail prep - use sparingly)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Foundation (base coat)&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Color polish (not included in kit)&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Top It Off (top coat)&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: Nail Surface Cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Step 6: Nourish (rehydrates the cuticle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this review a 4/5 stars simply because they dont include instructions. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Works really well for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> Please read \\&quot;A. Crafton\\&quot; review. Excellent review and comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got my \\&quot;Gelish Mini Basix Kit\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gelish Mini Pro: 45 LED Curing Light\\&quot; today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many others, the 8.5x11 bubble mailer for the kit was damaged (a 3 inch tear in the middle), yet the kit itself was intact, though a bit squished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PH Bond prep is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol. The Foundation base and the Top It Off sealer appear to be nearly exactly the same ingredients listed in the same order. The foundation appears to be a bit thicker than the top coat. All the small bottles with brushes are .30 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nail Surface Cleanse appears to be mostly Isopropyl Alcohol with some Acetone thrown in. And the Artificial Nail Remover is mostly rose scented Acetone. These two items are in 2 oz bottles with a foil seal under their caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, in the early 90&#x27;s, I bought some type of clear gel product and UV Lamp at a state fair. Worked good but I worried about the repeated use of the UV lamp. It felt very hot. I scared myself out of using it and gave it away. Ten years later I taught myself to do do my own acrylic nails after a bad experience; the manicurist I went to ignored what I was telling him (I have very thin nails) and quickly wore a hole in the middle of my nail with his Dremel while trying to \\&quot;ruff up\\&quot; my nail. It cut the nail bed and he insisted on \\&quot;fixing it\\&quot; by covering it with the acrylic stuff. It bled a great deal and stung worse... I should have walked out after he damaged my nail. The shop still forced me to pay full price because he \\&quot;fixed it\\&quot;. Others have changed the shape of my nails to suit their whims in spite of asking them not to shape my nails. And once I got a woman who could not do my nails properly because they were \\&quot;too petite\\&quot; (not too short, my nails are just small). It took her two extra hours and I still had to pay full price and then go home to file them down myself because she had made them so thick they looked like animal claws! It took me hours! So I don&#x27;t trust manicurists anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Gels are much different, and easier, and barely any detectable odor with the Foundation and Top It Off. Which is so nice because the acrylic nail products reek! I also really want \\&quot;clear\\&quot; nails so I don&#x27;t have to commit to a color. This has been stopping me from trying Gel Nails. After surfing the net and YouTube, I came across this trick: One can use just the foundation and the topcoat and have a \\&quot;clear colored\\&quot; nail. One person wrote: \\&quot;Harmony recommends for best performance you use a \\&quot;color\\&quot; layer. Simple Sheer is their basically clear color coat. It has a very slight pink tint, but once it&#x27;s on your nail you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s anything but clear.\\&quot; Another person wrote: \\&quot;I just used IBD Superbond, Gelish Foundation and Top-It-Off and it wore like steel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the IBD Superbond base and a bottle of the Gelish \\&quot;Simple Sheer\\&quot; in case the base/top coat alone isn&#x27;t enough. IBD is supposed to be a stronger bonding agent than the Gelish (or any other) base. Those items haven&#x27;t arrived yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing is, once I have the clear gels set, I can paint my nails with regular (non gel) nail polish. The polish is easily removed with NON-acetone remover and won&#x27;t affect the gel nail underneath. Halloween is coming up and I don&#x27;t want to be stuck with Halloween nails for 3 weeks after Halloween! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just did my nails, (only using the Gelish PH Bond, Foundation, Top It Off) and I am pleased with the results. They don&#x27;t feel hard and stiff like acrylics. They feel like a very durable version of a good quality top coat. I can still bend my nail somewhat but not nearly as flexible as before. Unlike acrylics which are stiff and don&#x27;t bend. Not good when bumping into things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I used a Bounty paper towel instead of special lint free wipes and had no problems with lint/fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I garden, craft... use my hands a lot in general. Gotsome gardening tomorrow so we will see how they hold up. I do wear gloves, but they make my hands perspire, so not sure how they nails will react. I&#x27;m going to make sure I use gloves doing dishes and laundry to keep the manicure looking nicer longer. I&#x27;m wondering how they will do after being in a pool. Will post again when I have some more feedback on wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing is... I&#x27;m NOT using the cuticle oil. In the past, oil has made my acrylics lift faster and I suspect this may happen again with the gels. I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream in the round tin. I might try that sparingly, later, and see what happens. It&#x27;s more waxy than oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by some other reviewers, there are no instructions in the Mini Basix Kit, only a description on the box of each product. Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them. However, the \\&quot;Gelish Mini Pro: 45 LED Curing Light\\&quot; (that I purchased through Amazon) did have a booklet with instructions as to using the light and how to apply the gel products. Now that I look at it, it appears to be a booklet for another Gelish light: the LED6G battery operated... so maybe that booklet got in my packaging by accident. Hey, lucky me! (Lots of Sally Beauty Supply advertising in it too.) No matter, the info still applies. I&#x27;m assuming my LED light does come with a booklet too, just not the one packed in my lamp box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 6, 2014: I stand by my above review. It is a good product. However, this is not for me. I used this off and on for several months and after awhile my nails became thinner and my nail beds became bumpy. Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics. I&#x27;ve always had thin nails anyway, so I think even this less damaging product is not for me. Someone with thicker nails may not have this issue. It took quite awhile for my nails to grow out smooth again. I can live with short natural nails. One less thing to fuss with.some gardening tomorrow so we will see how they hold up. I do wear gloves, but they make my hands perspire, so not sure how they nails will react. I&#x27;m going to make sure I use gloves doing dishes and laundry to keep the manicure looking nicer longer. I&#x27;m wondering how they will do after being in a pool. Will post again when I have some more feedback on wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing is... I&#x27;m NOT using the cuticle oil. In the past, oil has made my acrylics lift faster and I suspect this may happen again with the gels. I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream in the round tin. I might try that sparingly, later, and see what happens. It&#x27;s more waxy than oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by some other reviewers, there are no instructions in the Mini Basix Kit, only a description on the box of each product. Not a problem, since there are many tutorials available on YouTube, one only has to type in \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; to find them. However, the \\&quot;Gelish Mini Pro: 45 LED Curing Light\\&quot; (that I purchased through Amazon) did have a booklet with instructions as to using the light and how to apply the gel products. Now that I look at it, it appears to be a booklet for another Gelish light: the LED6G battery operated... so maybe that booklet got in my packaging by accident. Hey, lucky me! (Lots of Sally Beauty Supply advertising in it too.) No matter, the info still applies. I&#x27;m assuming my LED light does come with a booklet too, just not the one packed in my lamp box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 6, 2014: I stand by my above review. It is a good product. However, this is not for me. I used this off and on for several months and after awhile my nails became thinner and my nail beds became bumpy. Not unlike when I used to have my nails professionally done with acrylics. I&#x27;ve always had thin nails anyway, so I think even this less damaging product is not for me. Someone with thicker nails may not have this issue. It took quite awhile for my nails to grow out smooth again. I can livewith short natural nails. One less thing to fuss with.</li>
            <li> This Gelish Basix kit is a must for those who are starting out with gel nails.  It has everything we need to get started minus the gel polish in the color of our choice and the UV machine to cure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are the following:&lt;br /&gt;* pH Bond&lt;br /&gt;* Foundation&lt;br /&gt;* Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;* Nail Surface Cleanse&lt;br /&gt;* Nourish&lt;br /&gt;* Artificial Nail Remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are very small.  Two of them are opaque, so I don&#x27;t know how much I have left after doing my nails twice.  I think I have enough of each left for at least one or two more nail applications and then I may need to start replacing as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are on the bottle and the box, but the font is so small, it&#x27;s very difficult to read.  I don&#x27;t know if I do everything by the book, but here is what I do and it works for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) pH Bond -- 2 minutes UV light&lt;br /&gt;2) Foundation -- 2 minutes UV light&lt;br /&gt;3) gel color of your choice -- 2 minutes UV light (repeat for total of 3 coats)&lt;br /&gt;4) Top It Off -- 3 minutes UV light&lt;br /&gt;5) wipe off with Nail Surface Cleanse -- no UV light&lt;br /&gt;6) Nourish the cuticles and surrounding skin -- no UV light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Apply everything in thin coats, and don&#x27;t get polish on your cuticles or it will lift and peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the artificial nail remover to remove the polish when done.  I recommend a very absorbent cotton, like the type used in disposable powder puffs.  Cut them down to size, soak them in the artificial nail remover, put them on the nails and wrap with foil.  In a few minutes, you will see it start to crackle.  At that point, the polish is easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is very complete.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and not each and every bottle individually.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  Just wish the instructions were easier to read.</li>
            <li> Great for people who want to try make no chip manicure at home. Has everything needed and quality is pretty satisfying.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> I had this done in a salon that was very expensive and thought, wow, I can do this myself.  If you can paint your nails, you can do this.  Be aware that yes, the layers stay tacky until you put on the top coat.  And I mean tacky! I touched it with my finger and it left a fingerprint. I thought it was going to turn into a gookey mess and a waste of money but once you put on the final coat and then clean it off it is beautiful and looks very professional.  I bought a LED light at another place that cures in 45 seconds.  This stuff is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product works as described if instructions are followed. The small quantity is enough for several mani pedis. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Did not contain lint-free pads as advertised. Other than that, I have no complaints. I don&#x27;t change my polish very often, so the smaller sizes will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Contains everything you need to complete a gel manicure-EXCEPT THE COLOR. You have to buy the colors separately. You may be dissappointed to see how tiny the bottles are, but I&#x27;ve been using mine for 5 months now (at least once a month)and haven&#x27;t come close to running out yet. It takes awhile to get used to the technique, but this set is totally worth it! My manicure lasts at least 3 weeks! No chipping or flaking, even though I wash dishes and do alot of typing. This stuff is almost bullet proof. If you are used to using regular polish, this is not much different-you&#x27;ll be able to figure it out pretty quickly. You have to buy a UV-Lamp. Get the big one that will do one hand at once, it&#x27;s a big time saver. You&#x27;ll be happy with all the money you save not having to go to the salon. I&#x27;m a big fan of this system.</li>
            <li> I brught tGelish Basix Kit and a UVA curing light.  It was hard to apply and it last for about two weeks.  Im going to try the Gelish color polish next.  The treat is to wripe each nail between coats.  I use regular alcohol pads from drug store.</li>
            <li> Product worked perfectly. Just like the salon. Used with uv light. One thing to note is that your nails will be tacky after using the top it off coat. You have to wipe the layer off using the finishing cleanser. I didn&#x27;t know that at first so ended up doubling my time under the uv light before I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li> Love this mini kit because it has everything I need for a home gel manicure all in one kit!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and great price!</li>
            <li> I tried this polish and loved how it looked and how long it lasted. However, the fumes from it made me cough and cough and I nearly completely lost my voice. I am a singer and can&#x27;t be around something this toxic. I wonder how people who work in nail salons tolerate these fumes.  Although I love the way it looks and how long it lasts, I truly can&#x27;t stand the fumes from this product. It also made my nails very brittle and one just peeled and tore right off.  I am no longer doing gel manicures because of the toxic fumes, but will go with something like Butter London, which is supposed to last quite a while but not require all the steps of a gel manicure. It is also fast-drying.</li>
            <li> I loved this little set for starting to do gel nails at home :) thanks!</li>
            <li> Great starter kit. Getting your gel set up started gets expensive, so this is a nice way to cut that initial cost. My bottle of PH was open and had evaporated. I&#x27;ve read reviews of this happening before. Luckily the vendor I purchased it from sent me a new, full sized bottle!</li>
            <li> Every time I have previously tired either an acrylic or gel kit the nails pops off after three days or so.  Till now my life has been full of nail fail.  :(     Not so with Gelish!!  the For the very first time I can do my nails without them falling off in under a week.  Yay for Gelish! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> First time doing shellac/gel nails myself, pretty easy to understand, wish the bottles were larger though. They were more at sophora though.</li>
            <li> every things ok and I like them. but to small items I had thought. it help me better for my work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl and she really likes it, we had to watch a you tube video on which bottle to use first but works good, her nail look good.</li>
            <li> Love the kit, it has everything I need to do my nails just like a salon.  The top coat can go on a little thick, so that is something you&#x27;ll want to use sparingly but overall well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not a very good product....gave it away</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the gel nails I get done at the salon, but the process seemed simply enough for me to try to do it at home. I ordered this set and was excited as it was supposed to come with a DVD or instructions. All that was shipped was the box with the different application bottles, which seemed damaged in shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go on youtube and research on my own to figure out how to and what to use each bottle for.&lt;br /&gt;The Foundation seems way more gummy and it will take some practice I guess on applying thinner coats? Like they seem to do in the salon, but since it is the same brand my salon uses I decided to not send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One concern I had, my nails are very healthy, but when i apply the foundation/base code(mind I do not omit any steps) and put it under the UV light, if burns for the first 3 seconds. I never experienced this at the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since others left such positive reviews I will continue to try it out. Tried it out one more time, what a disappointment, am sending the kit and the UV LAMP back, the burning sensation continued, my nail tech advised something must be wrong with the gel application kit or UV Lamp or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile it definitely took a toll on my nails and I definitley will go back to the salon to get my gel nails done the right way.</li>
            <li> Nail polish never stays on my nails longer than a day without chipping. I&#x27;m not a fan of acrylics. Gelish solves my problem. My nails look great until new growth gets obnoxious. I am a nurse and very hard on my nails. Even two weeks after my nails are done the color still looks shiny and perfect! With this kit, color and a UV light, I can keep my nails up at home for what two trips to the salon would cost. Thank you Nail Harmony!</li>
            <li> it said that it should last 2 weeks but it was more like 2 days, I was really trying to be good wearing gloves to do the dishes but, still the whole polish would come off in a hard piece. I will try it again but not sure it will work</li>
            <li> I ordered a Gelish Basix Kit - when I opened it the ph bond was empty and the polish remover was open and leaked in the box.  and now it&#x27;s too late to return.  BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> I like this product because it lets you decide if you want to buy the product in larger amounts without spending too much. I’m still using my bottles a year after buying them. That tells you how much you’re getting. Be careful to tighten the lids well though, if you don’t they tend to leak a little. Also don’t waist your money on restocking of the liquids that come with this. They are just acetone and pure rubbing alcohol. Just go to any drugs store and buy some for a lot less money. The rubbing alcohol gets off the stick top cot and cleans the nail before applying the base coat. Then soak your nail in the acetone to get the polish off. Try using cotton balls and tin foil wrapped around the nail for about 15-20 minutes. I hope this review helps anyone wanting to start using this product themselves.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this item here on Amazon! Purchasing from here really saved me some money! Everything was brand new and it all works perfectly. I LOVE Gelish! :D</li>
            <li> its a perfect kit for getting into the gelish products.  I love gelish nail products and it has everthing except the light to get you off to a good start.  clear directions and everything all in a sample size box which is great for travel.</li>
            <li> Great kit for someone just starting and not sure about gel soak off polish.  Has everything you need! Just had to purchase a color to go along with the kit</li>
            <li> Deffenitly not what I expected for the $$$ lessen learned !! If you are the kind of person that don&#x27;t have the time to pack and send items back when you are not satisfied stay away. So you don&#x27;t wast your money like I did!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife a long with the [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]. She went from getting gel nails at the salone ($35 and chip after about 3 days), to having her nails look professionally done for weeks at a time. When used properly, this stuff is very high quality and looks amazing. I&#x27;d have to say that ever after a week and a half her nails still look like they were just done the same day. She loves this stuff and when this kit runs out we will upgrade to the larger size.</li>
            <li> This set is definitely &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; sized.  Don&#x27;t even try to read the instructions on the bottles.  But I do think this is a good way to decide if you like a product or not.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> perfect set if you just want to try. i have had mine for over a year and have done LOTS of mani, pedis and just now had to buy a new top an base coat.</li>
            <li> used it the first time with my 54 watt royal nail uv light machine... And my nails looked like I actually went to a salon and had them done!!</li>
            <li> Works well! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Products are old. The ph base was completely evaporated, the gels are too viscous and gooey, resulting in a poor finish, even with the aid of curing lamp.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit! I have done my nails quite a few times already and this little kit goes far. The box has has step-by-step instructions as to which bottle to use in which order. Also, each bottle is clearly identified with it&#x27;s purpose so doing gel nails is pretty easy!</li>
            <li> I started doing my nails with gelish long time ago but it was always my sisters. Now that I have my own I have to say that I really like this starter kit. It really lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This kit had all the tools that my daughter needed to complete her Nail care.  She was pleased with how the products worked.</li>
            <li> The bonus items weren&#x27;t in the box and the cover of one of the nail polishes was loose and leaked in the box. I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet though.</li>
            <li> This kit is great.  You will be able to do your nail many times.  The look is professional.  Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a very good product. I never thought I would be able to take care of my own nails, but this kit is great for learning how to do it.</li>
            <li> I chose this because i&#x27;m new to the whole &amp;#34;diy&amp;#34; nails. It loses a star because the directions on the box and bottles is unreadable because of text size and color. I had to research it online. Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product. Stays on well, which is no small feat for my nails. Using this product has allowed my nails to grow out.</li>
            <li> I received this within 2days! And I used it right away! The mini&#x27;s are just that mini&#x27;s LOL but if your just starting off its perfect! Will be ordering the regular size foundation and top coat next week! Its so easy to do just have to be careful around edge of nail! I did have to do my thumb over but Im very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beginner kit. Keep in mind it&#x27;s small, but it still seems to last a while. I purchased a LED lamp with it which is about $120ish, but you can also get a UV. It will be slower, but my guess is it still works.&lt;br /&gt;When using the top coat, be aware that it is very thick and tends to clump. If you&#x27;re not careful, it will get on the sides of your fingers, on the cuticle, past the nail, which can make your manicure not last as long. (Once it&#x27;s dry, the thick, hard coat can be peeled off, basically breaking the secure, hard gel.) if you get used to that, though, it&#x27;s great to have a manicure last so long, and be able to use your hands IMMEDIATELY after doing your nails. No more scuffs!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the directions on the bottle are SO small. Try to find them online or at another beauty store if you&#x27;ve never done this before. It&#x27;s important to start with the ph balance, which they don&#x27;t tell you.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with your gorgeous nails!!</li>
            <li> I loved the kit!  It worked perfectly.  I took my time and I loved the results. I think buying the mini bottles for home use makes sense.  You won&#x27;t have to toss product out.  Shipping was fast and I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> the only issue I have is the price for the amount of product, it IS clearly in the description that this is a MINI kit, but it does have everything that I NEED (except the UV light), I wanted the kit for the first time I did gelish, as with many of the other reviews say, you can get more product for cheaper, but I wanted to KNOW that I did everything just right, so I was fine with paying a little higher price for the amount gotten, I am totally sold on Gelish!! It really does last, does not chip, stays well and looks amazing, and totally shiny AND the odor is so much less than regular polish. I won&#x27;t order the kit again, but I LOVE the product, I am totally hooked on Gelish!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love everything you get with this starter kit. Even though they&#x27;re mini sizes, it&#x27;s still a great deal because with gel polish manicures, you only need a very thin coating and that in turn means you get a lot of uses out of these mini bottles. I gave 4 out of 5 because my pH bond bottle was broken during shipping and I didn&#x27;t get the chance to try it out. However, the pH bond is simply a nail dehydrator and so any brand will work just as well.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for a 1st time user to the gelish uv nail polish experience.  Has everything a person needs.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. Everything you need all in one box. I use a 36W UV light and it works great with the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> I love getting no-chip manicures but it can get pricey!  I was excited to learn there were options to perform no-chip manicures at home.  I purchased this Gelish set as well as a UV lamp and I could not be more happy!  My at-home polishes are just as great as those done in the salon, stay on as long, and don&#x27;t chip!  I&#x27;ve also tried to remove and it was super easy to do at home.  So excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  If you can paint your own nails without painting your cuticles and fingers than this is for you.  Just go lighter than heavier with the gel do a thin coat and make sure you coat the ends of your nails just like when you paint them and paint the tips.  For those who wonder why it drys tacky all I have to say is that you have never gotten your nails professionally done because when a manicurist does a gel set they are always tacky until they are wiped off after the last coat so don&#x27;t expect them to be dry after each cycle.  They won&#x27;t be dry  until you wipe them off at the end and you shouldn&#x27;t be touching them anyways a manicurist would flog you for that one.  I bought a 6w led light from Sally beauty for $55 and it worked beautifully.  So bottom line if you can paint your own nails then you can do this.  Just follow the steps to a tee and put the coats on thin and you will have an awesome shiny long lasting manicure.  Pays for itself the first application.  This would have cost $50-$100 at a nail salon since they would have considered this a new gel set. Be creative and have fun!</li>
            <li> The Gelish Nail kit is amazing. This is a mini kit, but you will get plenty of uses out of it. Its very easy to use all you need to do is stay on your nail. Keep nail polish remover and a flat brush handy incase you need to make quick fixes before curing. Takes less than an hour, lasts for weeks. Strong like acrylic, wont damage your nails the way fake nails do. Saves me money and time!!</li>
            <li> I have never been particularly gifted when it comes to painting my own nails so for years I have shelled out a small fortune having them done.  For the last few of these years I&#x27;ve been going to a place that does &#x27;gelicures&#x27; and uses Gelish products.  Frankly, the whole gel process looks like it would be a lot easier to do at home than the more old school acrylics, wraps, etc.  With the cost of everything else going up I decided that now might be the time to give an at home manicure a try and boy am I glad I did!  I ordered this kit, a thermal spa light, some lint free wipes and a couple of colors here on Amazon; the whole thing cost me right around $100 (I purchased 3 colors)...just a touch more than what 2 manicures would cost me if you factor in the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products arrived, at first I was a bit shocked by the size of the bottles in this kit, they seem very small but after using them I realize that although they&#x27;re small these bottles will probably last me at least a dozen manicures.  After everything arrived I really put off trying it because I was sorta afraid that when I was finished my nails would look awful and I&#x27;d have to face the fact that I wasted all of my money but today I got brave, opened the packages and went to YouTube and watched a couple of videos on how to both take off my existing gel as well as put on a new set.  Unless you already are familiar with the process of applying gels you&#x27;re probably going to have to do this because the kit does not come with instructions.  I have to say, the process wasn&#x27;t too bad at all.  In fact, because it&#x27;s self leveling I found it MUCH easier to apply than traditional polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, my nails do not look quite as fantastic as they do when I come out of the salon, but darned close...especially for a first try.  The product did exactly what it was supposed to do and works beautifully.  Any little problems have to do with my novice painting techniques rather than Gelish.  This being said my nails LOOK GREAT!  I did learn that the topcoat seems to move a bit when curing so next time I will use less and not get it quite so close to my cuticles but other than that it&#x27;s all great.  Overall, I&#x27;d say the &#x27;less is more&#x27; approach to applying the product is probably a big key to success.  I also think that using a light color until I get used to the process was a really good idea (a big thanks to one of the previous reviewers for this tip).  The light pink I used really keeps my little errors from being noticeable.  I really don&#x27;t think anybody, other than me, will notice them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re thinking about trying this system I say go for it!  If I can get my nails looking good, anybody can!  And, even if I end up buying 10 more bottles of color and rebuy some of the basic products I figure I&#x27;ll be saving about $1000 a year AND I can actually put the product on my toes so I don&#x27;t walk around with slightly smudged or dinged pedicures :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wasn&#x27;t really sure what all I needed to do my own gel nail polish. I think that these are definitly worth purchasing rather than going and buying them all individually at the beginning. It is important to note that these are MINI bottles, which is what it says in the picture. I have done at least 4 different gel manicures so far and there is still plenty of the nail polish for many many more. The gel nail remover does go quite fast I have noticed because if you do not put a lot on your cotton pad then it does not come off as easily and you end up scraping a lot off. So out of all the products  you will likely purchase the remover long before any of the other products in this have to be purchased again. Also note that you have to purchase the nail color separately! I would suggest Bashful first so that you can practice with it and that way if you mess up then you don&#x27;t have a bright red nail polish mistake. Great beginner purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome kit when you begin to start doing gel manicures.  Gives you everything you need.  You may have to google on the order of the application steps as the instructions were not very clear.  But it was easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish nail color...the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the box and the print on the bottles was to small to read even with a magnifying glass due to the color of print and the color of bottles.  Bad packinging.  I found limited instructions on the internet and the product is good, I have experience with another product similar and was able to use it.  If someone did not have prior knowledge probably wouldn&#x27;t work for them</li>
            <li> I would for sure buy this product again from this seller it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying from the store it&#x27;s outrageous how much they charge! Maybe the size of all the products are small but I guess that&#x27;s my only complaint but there is nothing this buyer has to do with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that cannot for the life of me keep regular polish on my nails for more than a day or two without it chipping badly, so to no one&#x27;s surprise, my discovery of gel nail polish was nothing short of earth shattering to me.  After getting my nails done twice at the salon, I did however, get tired of paying $25 bucks a pop for my awesome nails.  Mind you, to some this is totally worth it considering the mani&#x27;s last for close to three weeks but I&#x27;ve always been a DIY kind of girl so when I found this kit (same brand my tech was using) for such a good price, I jumped on it.  This kit is great.  It comes with everything you need to get started, minus the light and actual colored polish, and the product itself is super easy to use.  There are a few steps but the product&#x27;s consistency makes perfect application super easy, and it&#x27;s very easy to fix mistakes, should you make them, prior to curing the layers.  The bottles that are included are the smaller size, but after doing my own and a few friend&#x27;s nails, it&#x27;s obvious that the only product that might need replacing in  the next 6 months is the artificial nail remover.  A friend of mine had previously bought another brand name kit through a living social special and she was much happier with the results of the gelish kit, and plans on buying one herself now.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this until I found Gelish tests on animals.  Sorry Gelish you wont be getting my money towards animal cruelty and suffering.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first gel kit and have not regretted it since! I just upgraded to the full size kit. I bought the mini in December and used it every 2 weeks for myself and to do my sister&#x27;s nails a few times and still have some left at the start of April. This is a Great product. I have tried others and also a friend has recently tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Gel system and we have been disappointed. Nothing seems to last like the Gelish. It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this Gelish basic kit.&lt;br /&gt;It has no instruction no color gel just base stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I thought It has gel inside.&lt;br /&gt;Size was small and totally expensive.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1MVAE6L6TWPJG]]My wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails so they looked professional.  We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses and this same kit was $49.99 and on Amazon it was 47 % less expensive for the same kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also checked Amazon for Gelish UV nail polish and the prices were lower for the 0.5 ounce size for the same product that the beauty supply house was selling for $15 for the 0.3 ounce size. You can also find a broader selection of colors on Amazon.  Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the bottles in this kit are the small ones but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use. You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time. We also use alcohol swabs and regular fingernail polish remover. We spend a lot of money on fingernail polishes from Gelish and there are a lot of great colors available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process of doing gel nail polish was new to us so we had to do some research to find the right technic.  We used a UV cure nail lamp and had great results.  Here are the steps we followed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape nails using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish pH Bond to nails.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 1 minute under UV light.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV cured gel polish to the nail surface and to the nail edge.&lt;br /&gt;* Place hand into the USpicy UV light for 2 minutes for a light color and 3 minutes for darker colors&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail.  (Condition your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish.  The quality of the products is very good and the results are spectacular.  Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly.  If you enjoy doing your own nails and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon you will love these products. For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  My wife has already had several compliments on her nails in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this kit and the Gelish products including the nail polish and she recommends them to you.es for darker colors&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail.  (Condition your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish.

            <li> I am very happy I decided to invest in this product. I have used store bought gel polishes before and usually later in the day or by the next morning they are already chipping or having those weird looking cracks in them. I have only had this one on for four days and with the excetption of one nail they are still perfect but that is because that nail was peeling before I put the gel on. I work in retail and am very hard on my nails and am excited to have something so easy to use and to be able to now do it myself. I am definitely going to recommed this product to my friends and am doing my mom&#x27;s nails tomorrow :) I haven&#x27;t tried the colors yet but look forward to seeing how they turn out.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit to get started. Everything is miniaturized and comes in a cute little box. Gel nails are definitely the way to go these days and gelish has a great product here. The first time I had gel nails done I went to the salon and they used gelish so that&#x27;s why I bought it and it&#x27;s been very easy to do and fun! I would also recommend getting an LED light, because UV can damage your skin. Amazon sells a great little LED light for around $80-90</li>
            <li> Great starter kit! Has the pH bond, nourish, foundation, and top it off in mini size bottles. Perfect for trying a little sampler. Also comes with a small cleanser, which removes the sticky tack off the top it off, and a polish remover sampler. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick sample, this is perfect. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying the big bottles, which can me $10 bucks a piece. The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like (which has NOTHING to do with the product) is how you have to be VERY careful not to let the gel polish get on the side of your skin. If you do, it is easy to peel off and doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all. You MUST put the gel on the outer tip edge as well to ensure a long-lasting manicure. I have yet to buy the gelish nail polish color. I have been using the foundation, regular polish, then the top it off. I let the regular polish dry completely before using the top it off (or else it will wrinkle from the heat/still being wet!). Once I learn how to use the product correctly and not get it on my cuticles, I will be golden!</li>
            <li> Great for anyone starting out with gels/shellac. Wish the size of the nail cleanser &amp; Artificial nail remover were bigger. Anyone planning to buy this - be forewarned. They are very small! (They are 2 oz bottles.) Foundation, Top It Off, etc are small as well (9ml) but as I&amp;#34;m only one person I get the feeling they will last me quite some time despite their small size.</li>
            <li> i bought this to start my own gel nail collection....perfect start kit. i&#x27;ve recommended this to others. great deal for $20+ because it is almost $40 in stores.</li>
            <li> was so excited to use this but the products were very sticky and hard to work with.  have tried other products I liked better.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have been able to save money by doing my own nails and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t come off quickly as I thought.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This package is half the price of what I would have paid at a beauty store. I love Gelish, probably the best brand out there for gel nails! Nails looks great and polish lasts for so long!</li>
            <li> I received this kit as a gift and was kind of afraid to give it a try, I&#x27;m really glad I did! While it takes some time, my nails look good for around two weeks. The polish doesn&#x27;t chip and it protects my nails from breaking. The bottles are pretty small, but you use such a small amount for each manicure that the tiny bottles will last for a long time. Keep in mind, if you run out of the nail remover, you can buy a big bottle of acetone; the nourish bottle is simply cuticle oil; and the surface cleanse is simply rubbing alcohol. You will run out of these things before running out of the foundation and top coat, but they&#x27;re cheap to replace. Do a little research before you get started and he results are pretty awesome. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Love gelish nails! And what an absolutely great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit FOREVER ago and I am ashamed to say that I am just getting around to reviewing it.  I tend to forget this part.  Anyway this kit came with everything you need to start your gel manicure and pedicure adventure and it&#x27;s perfect for beginners.  All the bottles are very small but don&#x27;t let that fool you, I JUST had to replace my top coat and base coat about 2 weeks ago.  That means the small bottles in this kit lasted me 2 years!  I can only imagine how long the large bottles will last me. I purchased this kit with the Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac Curing Light Timer 36 Watts and the combo was perfect.  The lamp is still going strong too with it&#x27;s original bulbs and I ONLY do my own manicures and pedicures.  I never go to a salon so this gets used every 2 weeks....faithfully.  This set all together paid for itself with 3 uses as I believe I paid right around $100 for everything.  As all you ladies know...one manicure can cost you $35!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I think for a starter kit this bundle does the trick. For more experienced, you may want the full size bottles of the specific products you&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> My first try didn&#x27;t go well.  My nails were not curing well.  They were tacky and smudged.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the new LED light I bought, or the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curing them for up to 4 minuntes!  Still not &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second try, went better.  I put the polishes in a bowl of warm water to thin out.  That did help &amp; I will contintue to use this trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding out that nails will remain tacky between coats.  Don&#x27;t touch the nails, just keep going with the steps.  I did each step 2 min. under the LED light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the end, after you have cured the top coat, take a lent free pad soaked in cleanser, and wipe off the tacky residue.  It will not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my third try, I did my daughters nails, using a different brand of nail polish color, following the above steps.  This time it worked perfectly!  Now I know that it&#x27;s the nail polish that was giving me a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish kit does make your nails look beautiful compared to just using regular nail polish, however it&#x27;s not quit the same as a nail salon gel manicure.  It&#x27;s not as hard or professional looking.  It still looks nice, and will continue doing my own maicures now that I have the resources!  You can&#x27;t beat the savings.</li>
            <li> Bought this and a UV Light to start my at home do-it-myself gelish nail salon. Literally the only other thing I had to buy to get started was my favorite gelish color...oh, and cotton rounds to rub your nails with alcohol at the end. After a few rounds yourself, you&#x27;ll learn what you can substitute with non-gelish brands and what you use most. I definitely recommend this starter kit for anyone just starting to do their own Gelish nails. It is SOOO EASY! Don&#x27;t waste your money at the nail salon. If you can do your nails with regular polish, you can do this.</li>
            <li> It definitely works. The gel stays put which is awesome. I bought this product to save money from taking trips to the salon. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that is used in my nail salon.  Using it at home proved to be very easy to do.  The directions are easy to follow, and I love the results!  I&#x27;ve used this product with other gel-type products (Not Gelish) and they work very well together.  Will purchase more when I run out!</li>
            <li> The product is really bad and if you buy it you will be wasting your money. I bought it and I could not return it because they won&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s everything you&#x27;ll need to get started without the pigment</li>
            <li> These gel polishes are great. You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li> This is the Same one I bought from sallys, for 50 dollars, great price, came Fast!! everythingis the same.</li>
            <li> The product is simple and easy to use. Product was as described and the service was prompt. Would purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> Just love it, so easy to use, stays at least two weeks and still looks like just painted. The shine is incredible. Perfect trial size, lasts for quite a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with her drying machine for her nails  I guess she enjoyed the kit to go with her dryer</li>
            <li> Bought this mostly for doing pedicures. It&#x27;s all small bottles, but you don&#x27;t use much each time, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter , she and her daughter thought it was the best every. Thank You</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely slow. It took 12 days to get here. I normally wouldn&#x27;t hold a seller accountable for shipping delays but I received the shipping notice 6 days after I paid. Not sure why it took that long to ship. Anyway, although the product seems ok it would not cure. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the UV light I have or if it&#x27;s the polish but I left it under the light for over 10 minutes and it&#x27;s still tacky. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Keep upright when stored because once opened, the liquid from the nail cleaner and acitone leaks out of its bottles</li>
            <li> This product is not at all what I expected and I am very disappointed. The contents are small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Greater starter kit if you want to see if gel nails are right for you.  Lasts a long time without having to buy the full size products.  You can then decide which products you need a larger size in.  Must be used with an UV light.  Gel nails lasts a very long time, at least 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to do my own nails because I couldn&#x27;t rationalize paying $45+ at the salon every 2 weeks for the same thing.  I bought the Salon Edge 36W UV light machine for $25 and this mini kit.  I was pretty nervous since I needed to use tips with this and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I watched several uTube videos to get comfortable with the process since no instructions were included in my box nor a CD.  It was quite easy.  My problem is more with my tips popping off than the Gelish product but I&#x27;m becoming a pro with each \\&quot;fix\\&quot; to the broken nail.  My husband and daughter laugh at me but I keep telling them I&#x27;m saving $5 per nail since that&#x27;s what it costs at the nail salon.  I also started buying these products at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  Buy their $5 membership card to save even more.  They give you a $5 gift certificate to use within 6 weeks.  This kit does NOT come with any nail polish.  I read several uTube videos that you can use regular nail polish but you have to wait for it to dry before putting the top coat on.  I found even when you use the Gelish nail color it&#x27;s still wet even after UVing them 4 minutes...2 minutes for each coat.  It&#x27;s really easy to use (and believe me I was petrified to start!!!) I also recommend one hand at a time&lt;br /&gt;1)  File the shape of your nail (or in my case put the tip on and file it down)&lt;br /&gt;2)  Use a cotton ball or small cut paper towel to use the blue liquid Nail Surface Cleanse over each nail&lt;br /&gt;3)  Use the pH Bond on each nail&lt;br /&gt;4)  Place a thin coat of Foundation on each nail and the tip of the nail....then UV light them for 2 minutes...once done saturate a cotton ball with 91% rubbing alcohol (I bought mine at CVS) and rub all your nails and the end of the nail with&lt;br /&gt;5)  Place one coat of polish over your nail and the tip of your nail and either let it dry (if using regular nail polish) or use the UV light for 2 minutes for gel polish&lt;br /&gt;6)  Place a second coat of polish over your nail and the tipand either let it dry or use the UV light for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;7)  Place a thin coat of the Top It Off on your nails and tip of your nails and UV light for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;8)  Using a cotton ball, soak it with 91% rubbing alcohol and rub it all over your nail and the tip of your nail&lt;br /&gt;9)  Switch hands and repeat #1-8....it&#x27;s amazing how shiny and smooth your nails are afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the gel, saturate a cotton ball with the pink solution Artificial Nail Remover and put directly on nail, wrap it with a piece of tin foil...NOTE:  Pre-making these so you don&#x27;t have to keep cutting them up is priceless.  Set the timer for 15 minutes and sit and wait.  Once 15 minutes passes twist the cotton ball/tin foil off and use a wooden nail stick.  File the nail down slightly and repeat on the other hand.  Once done, repeat #1-9 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes I learned....rather than keep buying the Artificial Nail Remover just buy pure acetone...it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  Also, when deciding on a color look at the color on the bottle.  It&#x27;s pretty true to color.  I asked the Sally&#x27;s attendant for Gossip Girl (a nice dark pink color) and she gave me Good Gossip (red glittery color)....after that costly mistake I realized there were two Gossips and went back and bought the correct one which is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. If you use it right the Foundation lasts forever. Mine lasted almost exactly a year and I do my nails once a week. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It says mini but I didn&#x27;t expect that mini, they&#x27;re probably only an inch 1/2 tall.  It works great though all the products are quality and I&#x27;d say a perfect starter kit.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works out perfectly, its a great kit.</li>
            <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.  It&#x27;s a good beginning for your nails.  You&#x27;ll love it.  It comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> This pack is nice. I have no idea what the &amp;#34;orange stick&amp;#34; actually does. My back came broken and few of the bottles were nearly empty. Must have been this way a while as it was smelly but not sticky.  Amazon took care of it.</li>
            <li> I realized that I can do my own nails with a small investment I would save money before long. So, I researched and found Gelish to be the best choice, IMO. It includes almost everything you need for DIY gelish nail polish. You need a LED light and some paper towels in addition to this basix kit. The pamphlet included gives instructions, but I suggest watching some videos on youtube for extra tips. The 2 things that stand out in my mind is to avoid getting polish on your cuticles and fingers -- and to apply thin coats. It the coats are too thick it will not cure (set) properly. You will love it!</li>
            <li> I researched these goods on Amazon... but, admittedly, bought them in person since I wanted to see it all first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product three times now. I agree with the other reviews - it&#x27;s easy to use and the results are better than regular manicures. I didn&#x27;t get 2 weeks out of my manicures, but I got more than a week each time, which is far better than salon manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, now, after the third manicure (and about 4 weeks of constant wear), I find that my nails are weaker and less shiny. Certainly, I don&#x27;t think that gel is as damaging as acrylics, but it&#x27;s not harmless. I would make sure to give your nails time to breathe between wearings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the removal agent is STRONG. Not only did it make my skin sting (because you leave it on to soak for 20-ish minutes), but because I was clumsy with all those silly tin-foils tips on my finger, I knocked the bottle over, and it ruined (like, really ruined) the finish on my night table. So, please be sure to use the remover near color-safe areas.</li>
            <li> Delivery, packaging and promptness was great! This is the perfect combo and size to try out for the first time the Gelish experience! I will soon be purchasing the full-size products. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will buy from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> the manicurist used this product on my nails a couple of times for $35-$40. it always came out nice and lasted for 2 weeks, maybe it can last longer but with me it doesnt because im always washing my hands. well im a big do-it-yourself kinda girl so i started my journey to gelish products which led me to amazon (of course). this product is great when used eexactly the way they say to. this is a trial size application of everything you need, except the color nail polish (sold seperately). the cuticle oil is regular cutiicle oil you can purchase from any store. i do recommend this product for first timers until you get the hang of the what portions you need for yourself, and if you are great portion control this can last fro many applications</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brand but it doesn&#x27;t last long like the original Shellac. Its cheaper here than regular stores, so for beginners i think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> this is way to thickI know it is suppose to be but I ended up buying another brand to use as told and base</li>
            <li> I love Gelish. However, cuticle oil in the kit was open and leaked all over everything in the box. Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> Shout out to &amp;#34;Japan Nails and More&amp;#34; on You Tube. I love this product and because I saw a review on You Tube I had no problem buying this. It is so easy to use and cost effective for me. I refuse to pay a nail salon to paint my nails. I will purchase again.  Thank you Anna</li>
            <li> My sister wanted to try out doing her own gel nails with a UV light. However, she didn&#x27;t want to make a huge investment into it until she decided how she liked it. So, I got her this kit and a relatively inexpensive light for Christmas. This kit was perfect! Even though the bottles are mini they still have enough in them for several uses - more than enough to decide if you like the product. Additionally, the mini sizes are a fraction of the price of the full sized bottles. The Gelish kit states that it is for LED lights but it will cure under a UV light too, it just takes longer (keep it under a UV light for at least 2-3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality of the product she and I were both happy with the results. I applied smoothly and evenly, it cured well, and it worked with UV light.</li>
            <li> This kit is THE BEST. It was my first Gel anything. I noticed in my nail salon they all used &amp;#34;Gelish&amp;#34; so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I received the kit yesterday and the first time I used it my nails turned out better than they do in the salon. I normally pay the salon $50 to do my toes and fingers, but with this kit I can do it over and over and save literally a bundle of cash, and my nails look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why anyone uses regular nail polish. This kit is SO EASY to use and I had my nails done in under 10 minutes. With regular polish I&#x27;d spend easily an hour on it only to mess it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, but I&#x27;ll be able to get plenty of uses out of it. It was perfect to test. If you&#x27;re just testing it, take my word and get the full size kit because this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a LED light by MelodySusie Violetilac 2013 Newest Super Mini Cute Portable 6W LED Gel Polish Nail Dryer -- it was about $20 bucks and works like a charm. It cures the coats in 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already blown up all my facebook friends about doing your own gel polish using this Gelish kit... It was SO EASY.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this nail system.. Since I started using Gelish, I have not gone back to regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful and it came super quick, in just two days. I used it as soon as I got it and it hasn&#x27;t chipped and it hs stayed shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the gel curing light we bought.  Turns out the light we got didn&#x27;t work.  When I went to return this kit, Amazon said it is unreturnable because it is toxic.  Huh?  The box was never opened, nor was the plastic wrap on the outside of it broken either!  It is brand new.  I ordered this kit through prime and there are no return restrictions listed.  Nothing.  Now I am stuck with a $30 kit I don&#x27;t need.  Only buy if you are positive you are not going to return it!</li>
            <li> I have received this however haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I will leave a different comment once I use this product.</li>
            <li> it was cheaper online then in stores. I would buy it again. k l k lk kl k kl l</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom, with USpicy UV Gel Lamp Light Nail Dryer Professional Finish Quick Dry+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves them, this came fast and she is very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy if your into this stuff.</li>
            <li> Made for a great gift, and it worked really well!  Would recommend it to anyone who wants nails that last much longer!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a prime eligible item on Feb 4th...its Feb 7th and the tracking information states that it won&#x27;t be delivered until Feb 12. If I had wanted to wait a full week for this item I would have ordered the non-prime eligible item at a lower $$. Would love to hear what amazon has to say about this. I&#x27;d like at least a price match (I paid $34.99, the non prime product with free shipping is $29.99) since the 2 day shipping that was promised was not delivered on!</li>
            <li> After using my daughter-in-law&#x27;s Gelish Basix Kit and loving the results, I decided to purchase my own.  I paid a fraction of what my daughter-in-law paid by using Amazon, BUT, there were no directions included!!  The kit had a shrink wrap and appears new, however, I notice other buyers have had the same experience.  That&#x27;s the sole reason for the 3 stars.  I went to the website on the back of the box and copied the directions. The company who makes Gelish need to improve their quality control.</li>
            <li> Item as described in picture. Works well and should last a good Amount of time. Small bottles but many uses out of them!</li>
            <li> This kit is a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; kit so the bottles are small, but it is more than plenty to do a lot of manicures especially since they last longer than regular polish. I think it is better to start with this small kit to make sure you like it before you buy the full size bottles. All you need with this kit is gelish polish and a LED light.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions on the gelish website, do every step, even the preparation to your nails before you start the gelish process, and it will work great. The secret is to apply in THIN coats. I received my kit and polish today, did my own nails for the first time with the gelish gel polish and it turned out perfectly and took no longer than a regular manicure. I just put this on my natural nails, no tips or anything. It looks like a regular manicure on natural nails, and doesn&#x27;t feel so thick and heavy like acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, as soon as I am done, I have totally dry nails. No sticky nails for a while to mess up. Right after I did my nails with this, I took a shower and washed my very long hair. came out with perfect nails too. This is great for me because I rarely have time to sit still long enough for my nails to truly dry completely and I always end up messing them up before totally dry. I also have to wash my hands alot and usually polish does not last very long before it is peeling and chipping off. I am anxious to see how long this type of gel polish lasts. It&#x27;s great so far. If you can paint your own nails, you can do this.</li>
            <li> I had had no experience with gel products, but was tired of waiting for polish to dry and everyone is using gel on top of their acrylic nails, so decided to buy here where the price is way better than Sally&#x27;s!! Have to say that I LOVE this stuff!!! Gelish applies extremely easy and I took the advice of other reviewers and applied very thin! It&#x27;s so awesome that as soon as you take your fingers out of the UV lamp, it&#x27;s hard and you&#x27;re done!! Best stuff I ever used!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I was spending a ridiculous amount of money at the salon getting my nails done. I wore acrylics for 25 years and decided to let my nails do whatever they were going to do. Well initially they were thin like tissue paper. I could have cried. So off to the salon I go and got a Shellac/Gel manicure. $40 later my nails were still thin and very short but the Gel manicure made them hard. Not acrylic hard but I had my REAL nails. So I go back every 3 weeks or so and noticed they were starting to grow.. Not Guiness Book record long but over my finger which was fine with me.  I started thinking - I&#x27;m not saving any money. I&#x27;ve just switched methods. With that said, I drove to Sally&#x27;s and bought THE KIT. I Youtubed a few things, didn&#x27;t bother with the DVD and got right down to business. I spent about $125 including the lamp thing and in a few months it will pay for itself! My nails look GREAT. The thing I really love is that - my nails aren&#x27;t being filed down shorter than I like. I&#x27;m using my OWN glass nail file (not some crap that&#x27;s been used on every nail in town) and its flawless. It looks very professional. I wear a very pale color (almost nude), so when they grow out its not that noticeable. But this kit was worth every penny. The kit is great for beginners. Although when I run out of product, I will substitute two bottles with Acetone and Rubbing alcohol. Removal was a trip because I tried to do the whole cotton ball soaked in Acetone and then foil wrapped around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look.. next time - I&#x27;m putting a little bit of Acetone in a bowl and just soaking the polish off. That&#x27;s what the nail salon did. Just stuck my fingers in a bowl of Acetone. Anyway, if you want to save money and have about an hour to do your nails GO FOR IT!. I can&#x27;t attest to the colors since I only wear very pale, or clear type polish.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this polish set I have used 3 or 4 times now it just seems to flake off in 4 days. I wear pink and white acrylic and never had a problem keeping it on with regular polish. So I tried it on my toes with the same company polish and light it took at least 4 times as long to dry as  it said it would. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.  I bought the light that&#x27;s portable.  The whole set up cost about 40$, much cheaper then at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit. The ph, foundation and top coat work well and last a long time. The Cleanser and remover and not needed but come with the kit. Once they were gone I used acetone and alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have had Gelish done at the nail salon and liked it. I thought I would try the home kit. It is the exact same quality as the professional salon product. I followed the instructions and it came out exactly like in the salon. The key is to make sure all the coats are thin. If you paint the coats too thick, they won&#x27;t cure correctly and may start to peel after a few days. It lasts about 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li> I did return this as I am not coordinated enough to do my own nails however my friend did for me and they came out amazing! This is half the price of Sallys for EXACT same thing !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gelish basic kit. Who wouldn&#x27;t like that? Adhere to the nails great. Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really love this products, wished they would make the product that doesn&#x27;t require a UV light</li>
            <li> Love it but I finally figured out what the prep tabs are for you put them on the end of the pusher to buff nail</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item. I enjoy doing my own nails. I learnt by watching it being done at the Salon. I might not be doing it completely correct but it turns out every time. I love this kit.</li>
            <li> Loved us this product. Goes on easy. Strong for nails. Will be buying again. Can&#x27;t wait to use more colors.</li>
            <li> This is so exciting and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails, it was my first attemp to do gel nail on my own, not perfect, but it am one very happy girl. I already did a better job to do my mom&#x27; snail so I believe after a few practice, I can do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U need to buy gel color, I got it in Sally Beaty and it is buy one get one free sale till the end of June. Go get it fast!</li>
            <li> Professional product, the same quality as nail salons. Everything you need except the actual polish is included.&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to do at home and cheaper in the long run.  Good product.  Good present for parents to give to teen age girls.</li>
            <li> Works very good, very surprised how long it lasted. Used to do acrylic, but that took to long, and the smell was bad. No bad fumes and nails last longer</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it worked perfect and my nails looked great.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was that the instructions didn&#x27;t explain how to&lt;br /&gt;remove the polish, I didn&#x27;t remove it correctly the first time so I really&lt;br /&gt;damaged my nails, but once i looked it up and asked around it&#x27;s all good&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a someone I used to know.. I guess she liked it...</li>
            <li> Good product, just takes practice, I have only used once.  My problem was need better directions, than ones on bottles.  They are so small, I even got a magnifiy glass and still couldn&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. Its so easy to use and very user friendly. However, instructions were not included so I downloaded them from online. Other than that, its perfect!!</li>
            <li> They come all in one and good product. I recommend this to everyone also. the good part is you don&#x27;t have to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> I like the products. Just wished it had the DVD like it comes in the local stores to demonstrate the how to do directions. I would like more color choices as well. But it get me what I needed to get started.</li>
            <li> Great transaction&lt;br /&gt;Great transaction&lt;br /&gt;This was a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was fast and it was just like they said&lt;br /&gt;So it was good</li>
            <li> Great size for personal use, my manicure stays on for always more than a week usually 2. Saved me a lot in manicures!</li>
            <li> I got this set and it could have been great but some of my bottles were broken.  I bought replacements and love the results.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the gellish system for about two months now. I am pleased with how long my nails have grown. Im also happy with the selection of colors. Although, i am displeased with how longnthe polish is holding up. A lot of reviews on here have said how long it lasts for them. I cant seem to make it 3 days without one nail peeling off. I have follwed the systemnwith the ph balancing step, base and topcoat. Im not sure what im doing wrong. I dojt think om putting it on too thick? Any one else have that problem.?</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the beginner gel nail polisher.  I was disappointed that the primer, base coat, top coat etc. were in small sizes.</li>
            <li> Great kit...I&#x27;ve ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> These kits are great to get you started. Everything you need is labeled and the instructions are quick and fast. I recommend this if you are going to do your own gel nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks! It peels within 24 hours!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s for three times the price and wont do that again! I&#x27;d purchase this kit here by far!</li>
            <li> as described - thanks</li>
            <li> Great kit for getting started.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews from others and found this was the best deal and it certainly was! I love this and love doing my nails!</li>
            <li> worked good!  I need to practice more.</li>
            <li> It has everything I needed to start doing my own gel nails. Will buy it again and do recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a gel nail system and I love it!! I was referred by a good friend who has been using this system for over a year and it has met my expectation!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product and used it exactly as directed. Unfortunately it takes a lot longer than recommended  to dry and pealed off after 1 day. I feel that it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its all in the description good price good quality best of all great packaging ! ;) my Girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> good product-thought the bottles would be a little bigger, but was happy to get started with doing my gel - nails at home.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit. I got this kit because I wanted to give doing my own gel polish a try. I loved it so mush I went out and got the full size products. This was perfect for experimenting.</li>
            <li> The only instructions were on the bottles which are small since this is an introductory kit, but the print was so small and light, I was unable to read the labels even using a magnifying glass.  I could not get the Artificial Nail Remover to work.  Perhaps if I could have read the instructions about how to mix it to remove my existing gel nail polish, I would have had more success.  Otherwise, the kit met my expectations.</li>
            <li> the kit was shipped fast, packaged well. However upon using the contents of the kit, the instructions require 4 steps. The consumer needs to have all contents of the kit for the gel polish to set and take affect. If one bottle in the kit is missing or has been replaced w a duplicate bottle of polish the entire kit is useless.  Therefore when the kit omitted the Top it off bottle of polish used to set the final step of gel polish on my nails was not included, the polish remained tacky. The polish would not dry. Therefore the kit is useless. Moreover I had to wipe away the polish from my nails since nothing would dry. Extremely disappointed in the product ... Never again.... and I will not recommend ........... +1 714 773 9758 the company&#x27;s number.I will report to BBB.</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I LOVE IT, but when I opened it, one of the bottles was completely empty. I had to buy a replacement at the store, but other than that, this product is great! It lasts a long time; it doesn&#x27;t chip or peel off unless you really try to peel it off. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> If you are not completely familiar with this product and completely sold on it, do not purchase . . . the seller does not accept returns, stating that some of the ingredients prohibit its return.  ????? - I&#x27;m wondering how they can ship it to me and I cannot ship it back in the same condition.  After doing much research, shellac nails are the new and best way to go - gel can do much damage.  Did attempt to contact this seller and was not given the courtesy of a reply.</li>
            <li> For someone who couldn&#x27;t keep regular nail polish on for 5 minutes without chipping this is a blessing. Also it&#x27;s really easy to do!</li>
            <li> love this! the bottles are small, but it does last a long time!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS WONDERFUL, POLISH STAYS ON FOR 2 -3 WEEKS , NO CHIPPING OR PEALING, LOOKS SO SHINY,  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I really like this, I was really wanting to start doing gel nails myself at home, and by reviews, this was the best kit, and everyone suggested gelish, so that&#x27;s what I went with, and this kit is great, it comes with everything you need, other than polish, which you don&#x27;t need if you just want clear nails I guess, but you can get the polish separate on here, and there are so many color choices, it seems expensive, but even though you apply a few coats, it still last a really long time, and so does this kit, even though the bottles are a little smaller, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of anything, so it will last a while, and you can buy items separate as needed, instead of buying the whole kit again, if you don&#x27;t need everything, but to get started, this kit is great, since it has everything in it (other than polish, remember to get your polish, you can even use another gel polish if you want, you don&#x27;t have to get the gelish polish, just be sure to get a gel polish, not regular polish, I havnt tried to use a gel kit with regular polish and im not sure how well that would turn out, so I suggest getting a gel polish, there a few different ones, opi makes one, sensationals, red carpet, ibd, and quite a few more, these brands also have the other items needed to do gel nails as well....), I do have the sensationall nail kit, that was actually my first, since it came with the uv lamp, YOU WILL ALSO NEED A UV NAIL LAMP! and it came with one polish as well, and the other needed items, base and top coat,ect. I do sometimes mix the polish&#x27;s and such, I don&#x27;t always stick to using the same brand polish with the same gel kit (base and top coats ect), and havnt had a problem with any of that, so don&#x27;t worry about doing that... I also have bought the ibd starter kit on here as well, and it came with everything except the polish and the lamp, the only kit I have found that comes with a lamp and/or a polish is the sensational kit, but all the items in that kit are very small sized, really tiny bottles of everything, but it was worth it for the lamp, which works great, however you can get a cheap lamp on here as well, so that is not really a problem either, and you will want to get a few polish&#x27;s (of any gel brand) as well, so you can change up your color and your nails. as well I purchased the gelish soak off gel structure, it is like a base that is made to strengthen your nails, and you can use it with the gel kits or alone, and it comes in clear and pink, and you can use it with acrylics as well, so it is multi purpose, and I normally use it when I do my nails, no matter how im doing them, with or without gel, and with or without polish, it seems to help a lot, I have wrote a review on it as well since I got it on here, and ibd makes the same product as well...&lt;br /&gt;now to the review of this kit, there is nothing wrong with it, I really do like it, I only give it 4 stars, as I have with most of the other gel products and kits I have got, because I have noticed that my nails have gotten weaker (I have always had weak nails), since I started do gel nails, and I&#x27;m not sure if its because im doing the gel nails or not, or if it is a certain product im using, or a certain brand that im using, since I have quite a collection now, and I also have the acrylic set, which the ibd gel set that I got on here (amazon) comes with gel for acrylics, (everything needed included, however I have ordered more tips on here as well and a clipper, it did not come with a clipper, they are only a few dollars though, and tips are cheap as well, there are even tips for toe nails on here, along with designed tips and colored tips), so you can get those items and mix it up, along with all kinds of additional tools,* you will probably want to invest in a nail brush set, which I ordered on here, and was really cheap and good quality ( I have reviews or will as soon as im done writing all of them, for all of these items), and there is gems and other things that you can get to jazz your nails up, which scared me at first because I thought it would be hard, but its actually pretty easy, and no I did not spend a fortune to get all the items I have, since most everything is just a couple dollars, and I have picked stuff up here and there, I didn&#x27;t just buy everything at once, which is totally unneccassary!&lt;br /&gt;*like I said, this kit is a great kit, and gelish is the most popular brand, and you can also pick up the items at sally&#x27;s if you run out of something they normally have all of it in stock, and you don&#x27;t have time to order on here, and they sell the polish&#x27;s as well, which makes it pretty convinent. just remember, the only thing you need for this kit is the uv nail lamp, and polish!!!&lt;br /&gt;and again, the only reason for the four star is because im not sure if this is what made my nails weaker or not, if/when I figure that out I will update all reviews...&lt;br /&gt;the package comes pretty fast, undamaged, unopened, as described, with everything listed included, and directions, which are really really simple, it is a little time consuming at first, but not much, and after a couple times, and doesn&#x27;t take that long unless you are doing something fancy. and it does last for a couple weeks, without chipping off, so it saves on mantaince, just keep your cuticules oiled and groomed and your hands and nails will look good for at least 2 weeks if not more! some people say they don&#x27;t need the oil, but I do use it, it helps keep your cuticales from drying out and such, and again cuts down mantience, plus with this you save all the money of going to the salon to have your nails done! major plus, you can do this anytime at home, watching tv or whatever, its convient, easy, low mantience, and cheaper! all major plus&#x27;s. and keep in mind, the bottles are large enough that you wont have to replace them all that soon, so the price for the whole kit is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this item, and the seller, since I didn&#x27;t have any issues with any of theproducts being opened, or shipping/packaging issues, ect, like I have with another seller of gel kits (see my other reviews....) so highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;sorry this was so long, I just wanted to give everyone all the info I have learned on the gel kits, so that you can make a good decision on your purchase of gel nails, and a kit, ect, and if your new to this, like I was, I hope this is helpful, I couldn&#x27;t find any long helpful reviews when I first started my gel nail search, so I hope this helps somebody out....</li>
            <li> I rarely gush about a product.  Most don&#x27;t wow me like this one.  This is a nail revolution!  Stop paying so much money at the salon and invest in the home kit!  It works just as well... isn&#x27;t too hard to do... and you&#x27;ll be thanking me later.  Best product I bought last year!~</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about this product and cannot wait to try it. I plan to post another review after that, however, initially wanted to comment on how quick this shipping was! It was so nice to not have to wait a week and to get it for the best price!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to attempt doing my own gel nails.  The product works great and doing my own nails was simple but time consuming.  The quantites of each item are mini size.  That is probably fine with bond, foundation, and sealer as a single user might not use enough before the product got old and thick.  The remover is good but had to buy a larger quantity for future removal of gel polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I did my nails Sunday and two days later the polish started peeling! I capped the free edge and everything! So frustrating because the color and shine was beautiful but what good is it if i can&#x27;t enjoy a week manicure let alone two weeks of chip free shine. I really wanted to love this bought a bunch of the polish colors but within a couple days the free edge started to peel up on my right hand every single finger! I thought this would save me hundreds of dollars but it&#x27;s not worth it. Didn&#x27;t work for me waste of hard earned money down the drain.</li>
            <li> ***NOTICE: everything in this kit is MINI-sized!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN GET THE FULL SIZED KIT INCLUDED WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE MINI GELISH KIT FOR COUPLE MORE BUCKS!!</li>
            <li> Others have gone into detail about how you can save money on some of the items, but the base coat and top coats are still a good buy - especially if you aren&#x27;t sure you want to do this.  I have crumby nails that split, so I keep them covered in just base &amp; top coat even if I&#x27;m not going to put color on them.  I still don&#x27;t grow my nails out long; however, for the first time, I can grow them past my finger tips and they don&#x27;t look like I chew them.</li>
            <li> I chose this system since this is what my salon uses and I&#x27;ve had this applied several times and love the product. Having two kids in FT childcare requires me to make cuts and spa services didn&#x27;t make the top of the keep list :(  Though the basic kit doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, I was easily able to find a YouTube video and followed along. I cured for 60sec using the MelodySusie 12w LED lamp (didn&#x27;t try it for 30sec) and it dried in one shot! I used Red Carpet LED polish. Overall...I love it!! I can have pretty nails on a budget that will look fresh for more than a few days which is important to this busy mom. Just need a little practice with the application and the amount of polish (a little does go a long way). Though the bottles are tiny, they will last awhile. Removal was easy too following instructions found on YouTube. Remover bottle will not last long. I used half the tiny bottle in my first use...not sure if maybe I used too much. Nails were left in excellent condition post removal. It doesn&#x27;t even look like I had anything on my nails and they feel natural and strong. I highly recommend this product!!! Just don&#x27;t get any on your skin and then cure because that&#x27;s how peeling starts. Recommend using a tiny brush to clean excess polish off skin before curing. I used a cheap eye liner brush and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I have saved money and time . This is a great product for busy people who hate to wait to get there nails done at the salon . I can have salon perfect when ever i want .</li>
            <li> Mini is an understatement.  I recommend buying the full size bottles of Gelish instead.  Skip the Gelish Acetone as it is exactly the same as regular acetone except they water it down some.  Pure acetone seems to work best.  Bottles are enough to paint nails MAYBE 3-4 times if you use everything sparingly.  You are much better off buying the full size bottles.  I&#x27;ve learned from my mistake and won&#x27;t repeat it.  Hopefully you can learn from mine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no instructions came with kit so I had to go to You Tube to find out in what order to apply things. Hassle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good with doing my nails. I need more practice, but this kit is awesome. As shiny as the polish is after curing makes your nails look professionally done, even when you suck at polishing techniques. LOL. But be mindful. I got a cookie crumb or something on the nail prior to curing and it was SET! Had to clip and file it down because it would not budge! Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> the kit came with everything I needed and I have done my nail many times with the mini bottles which is shocking but hey I&#x27;m saving money this way haha</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of nail product except polish before. It was so easy to use this. I will need to get better at the application process, but that will come with practice. I have had these on for 2 weeks now and no splitting or any wear showing. For once my nails do not break at a certain length. So wonderful to have nice nails. Thank you for making an easy user friendly product.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this kit.  I also purchased polish as the kit does not include a color.  I wanted an alternative to having my nails done in the salon.  With the purchase of this, the polish and the UV light, I figured it would only take 2-3x (depending on where I have them done) of preparing my own nails to get my money back.  The polish was very forgiving and easier to work with than regular polish in my opinion.  Only on day 3 but I can&#x27;t complain...I have typed, cleaned my bathroom among other tasks and my nails are holding up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I groomed my nails as usual, wiped with alcohol, applied a coat of the PH bonding agent, then applied the base coat.  I then used the UV light on the 2 minute setting.  Applied a layer of color, UV light 2 minutes.  Applied another layer of color, UV light 2 minutes.  Remember to seal your polish on the tips of your nails to prevent pull back.  I then applied the top coat and this time I used the UV light for 3 minutes.  I don&#x27;t know that I needed to go that long but it was my first time preparing my own gel manicure so I wanted to be safer than sorry.  When done, the feel is still tacky so I used the cleanser that comes with the starter kit and they just shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice, the cotton balls can leave lint so I would suggest a lint free cloth.  It would not have been an issue but I did one hand first and after wiping them down with the cleanser, the cotton ball stuck to a nail on the undone hand.  I managed but next time I will use a lint free cloth to prevent getting cotton in my polish and stuck on my nail again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt lasted 11 days and would of lasted a few more but I opted to re-do my nails as a matter of timing.  So so so pleased.  The polish came off, after soaking of course, quite nicely.  No real damage to existing nail.  I was so pleased I ordered a couple more colors and will continue to to my own gel manicures from here on out.</li>
            <li> i am definitely happy with this product. it is just what i paid for. next time though i will definitely buy the larger set because i will need it eventually anyway.</li>
            <li> Just know this product does not come with the DVD step, by step kit. I had to watch youtube turtorials on how to; &amp;#34;DYI gelish nails&amp;#34;. I did love the results but was a little bummed it did not include the DVD.</li>
            <li> this kit lasts it seems forever! it is a very good product and I continue to use it time after time and to refill products because they are so good.</li>
            <li> Awesome little starter kit--- while these bottles are smaller they seem to be lasting!  It helped me decide what items I actually will need in bigger quantities moving forward.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. My only complaint is in regards to the packaging. When I received this from the mail man I was nothing but excited to start my gel nail experience. I have used other products, but heard good reviews about gelish. I looked online and saw it on amazon for so much cheaper than what it was sold for in local beauty supply stores. I knew I had to order it. Imagine my surprise when I accepted the package from the postman only to open it and find one of the bottles had broken and glass was shattered everywhere. I was infuriated. The cuticle oil container was broken and oil was everywhere. The items were not held down in the package, and were loose in the box that they came in. I am not going to be returning, because the other items were just fine, it was just the oil. I will purchase cuticle oil elsewhere but still not to happy about me paying for something, and have it be broken when I receive it. It is an amazing product, just wish the people shipping it did more to protect the items in the package ie styrofoam, plastic wrapped around glass-- ANYTHING more than just sending glass bottles in a box that moves around. Common sense people!!!</li>
            <li> Product was shipped on time. I would recommend this product to those who want to do their own nails. It lasts a good amount of time and would probably last even longer if I didn&#x27;t like to change my polish as often. Thank you amazon for a great product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I am not a manicurist, but I&#x27;ve wathed my manicurist applying gel polish on my nails enough times that I figured I could save money and do it myself. I found some really good instructions and I have had my gel polish on for 3 days now. They still look perfect through two nights of bartending at my part time and three days of typing at my full time job. Through days of banging them on bottles, digging in the change drawer, spilling alcohol on them, washing them excessively, or typing as much as I do..no chips or peeling paint yet! Perhaps the Gelish brand had something to do with that because my manicurist uses something else that doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;These bottles are very small, like a sample kit. The kit runs $45-50 in stores and it was $27 when I bought it on Amazon. The ingrediants on the bottles let me know that I don&#x27;t really need all of these things when I start replacing them. The top coat and foundation are the exact same thing. The nourish is just overpriced cuticle oil. The PH is just acetone. The soak off is just acetone. And the nail cleanser is just acetone. I can get less expensive options for most of these and just invest in a large bottle of top coat/foundation with colors.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells many colors for around $12 for regular polish sized colors, whereas Sally&#x27;s sells the tiny bottles for $14! I got lucky and found a clearance color at Sally&#x27;s for $10, but it was still a tiny bottle. Inthe future, I&#x27;ll order in advance from Amazon when I want a new color.&lt;br /&gt;These are the instructions I followed.&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove old polish and use the cleanser w/ a lint free pad to clean off the nail. (If you use a cotton ball or something linty, it will show up later on your dried nail). Push back cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;2. Using a block buffer file, buff off the nail&#x27;s natural shine and shape the nails.&lt;br /&gt;3. Paint on the PH (which is acetone so it just vanishes off immediately).&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply a thin coat of the foundation, which is a gooey clear polish. Cure in the light based on the times on the box (1 minute for my UV light). It will be very tacky and sticky once cured. Use a paper towel or a lint free pad and wipe off the excess until it&#x27;s smooth, you will need to apply some pressure but do not touch the surface with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply the first thin coat of color gel polish and cure under the light per the box. (for my uv light and a dark color polish it was 3 minutes). Do not touch the polish, it will be sticky and will ruin the finish.&lt;br /&gt;6. Repeat step 5&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply the Top Coat the same way as the Foundation in step 4, including wiping it off after curing.&lt;br /&gt;8. Apply Nourish oil around the cuticle beds.&lt;br /&gt;I followed those steps to a T and my nails look better than I&#x27;ve ever seen them before. I will be saving a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Love this kit. The bottles look small at first, but it lasts a long time. I redo my nails every 2 weeks and have done my daughters&#x27; nails as well and I am still using my first set (10 months!) the price is half of what it costs at retail stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be easy to follow and use.  However, after 2 hours trying, it just won&#x27;t dry.  I have used the professional light but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  You cannot return either.  I am very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can do my nails and the polish last for about 2 weeks! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m really amazed at how well gelish lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself a gelish manicure last night and then today washed and waxed my car.  What a chore, but I was amazed how my nails still look perfect like I just stepped out from a salon even after waxing my car.</li>
            <li> I love my kit I&#x27;ve done my nails about 6 times and still have plenty applications left. Watch tutorials online to get the best application technique.</li>
            <li> Although salons around here only charge $35, I decided to try to do my own gel polish and save a bit of money.  Even though this is a starter kit, everything will last a long time except maybe for the acetone which can be purchased inexpensively at any store.</li>
            <li> I did my first gelish last night on my own and it worked great. I watched a few tutorials on youtube before I ordered it and it was really work the money. The bottle are really tiny but a lot goes a long way with the gelish.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to use if you are looking for an alternative to acrylic nail sets. I have found my nail set lasting just about two weeks..and I work quite a bit around the house. I am pretty rough with my hands and for this set to last through what I do day in and out...I give this a TOP RATE of 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> MY NAILS DONT CHIP ANYMORE, THE KIT DOES NOT COME WITH INTRUCTIONS BUT THERE ARE SOME GREAT YOUTIBE TUTORIALS. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Never ever thought I would be able to give myself a professional looking manicure but Gelish has changed that for me. I actually look forward to doing my nails and it&#x27;s all because of Gelish. This stuff is AMAZING, anyone that is having issues with this system has to be doing something wrong with applications. I have used the Gelish system mainly with ibd gel polishes which they work AMAZING together and I have even used normal polishes making the \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; with no issues. The mani does last 2-3 weeks when using all Gel Polish and my \\&quot;Gelly Sandwich\\&quot; mani&#x27;s last at least 2 weeks if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is EASY to use and I swear maybe it&#x27;s just me BUT it seems so much easier to paint the nails with Gel Polishes. I think because  it&#x27;s thicker and has that tacky feel but seriously you can&#x27;t mess this up unless you get too close to the cuticle bed or don&#x27;t clean the polish up from side of the nails before it sets. I always have an issue painting my right hand because I&#x27;m a righty, I had NO issues, no mess my right hand comes out very neat and pretty each mani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see people complaining about peeling and chipping but that has to do with the application itself not the product. No disrespect but you MUST follow the rules properly. Gel Polish goes on THIN and each coat must be cured COMPLETELY before applying another coat. One of the most IMPORTANT things to remember when applying which helps avoid the lifting and peeling is that each coat covers from right above the cuticle bed to the very TIP TOP of the nail. Gel Polish works almost as an adhesive, so when you move the brush up to the top of the nail you MUST cover the very tip, almost as if you are going to paint behind the nail. Make sure the Top Coat can stick to the nail so be sure to leave a smidge of the nature nail exposed by the cuticle as well so it can stick to the nature nail which would prevent lifting and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each coat of polish, Foundation, Color, Color and finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat should be THIN. The Gel Polish is thicker and spreads, it&#x27;s not like regular polish where if you don&#x27;t have enough and need to get more for a coating. Normal polishes you get the uneven look but with Gel Polish it doesn&#x27;t show, it all BLENDS together as one coat so no need to worry you don&#x27;t have enough when starting each coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easier to apply starting in the MIDDLE of the nail and working the Polish down and up and side to side, I found this to help me avoid the extra clean up of too much polish on the sides of the nail or gathering by the cuticle&#x27;s which I think gives the \\&quot;mani from home look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with others I don&#x27;t think this whole kit is a must UNLESS you are a newbie to the Gel Polish mani. Future purchases I will only be purchasing the MUST which I feel are the Foundation and the Top Coat. The extra&#x27;s are nice but I agree not needed and can be purchased randomly if and when needed. The pH bond I have yet to use, the Nourishment is nice not a must but more of an everyday treatment for your cuticles, the nail polish remover I have tons of from my local dollar store. The nail cleaner which is the final step is GREAT and I do use but you can clean the nails with peroxide or alcohol that you have laying around the house. The bottles are small but don&#x27;t let the size scare you, you will definitely get TONS of mani&#x27;s from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly.... (sorry for the novel) as for light I use an LED light because it helps speed the cure time up I have found the times listed on each step to be accurate.nd finish with Top Coat must be dried before applying the next coat and each coat should be THIN.

            <li> This is a must have if you plan on using gel polish! I have used it numerous times and it works well every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of time consuming to apply all those coats, but it has saved me a ton of money from having to go to the nail salon!</li>
