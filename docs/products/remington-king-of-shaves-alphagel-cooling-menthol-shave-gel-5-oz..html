    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>This shave gel is the best stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by this product and would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the shaves are great!</li>
            <li>Now using this product is the best shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li>and I am very impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>One of the best shaves/gel out there.  </li>
            <li>But Alphagel is very good, so still deserves all 5 stars.</li>
            <li>excellent deal, great product.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>I got a real nice shave - I&#x27;m happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to find on Amazon and considering how wonderful it is, it&#x27;s a very fairly priced indulgence.</li>
            <li>Alphagel works great for leaving your face feeling moist after shaving.  </li>
            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Great shave gel.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Best shave product I have ever used- better than aerosol gels, foam, or any creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because this gel is great!</li>
            <li>But with this product, I was extremely pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond that, I won&#x27;t argue if the cream has a pleasant smell and added skin benefits like aloe.</li>
            <li>this product is excellent and make shaving a true joy.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the aerosol ones, how it clung to his face after he shaved.</li>
            <li>A side benefit, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;It does FEEL good on the skin - it tingles - sort of wakes you up</li>
            <li>Almost none with a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>And Lubriderm is 99% as good, is cheaper than Alphagel, and is easier on the razor.</li>
            <li>I like gels and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, good product, I&#x27;d use it again.</li>
            <li>My guess is that they are not out to ruin a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My guess is that they are not out to ruin a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brother told me that was a good tip by the way</li>
            <li>I recommend that one if you want a good smelling foam.</li>
            <li>When the original King of Shaves won the award from the Magazine For Him for best shave gel, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;From a woman&#x27;s point of view, the smell is very appealing</li>
            <li>If not, the more affordable shave creams can get the job done too!</li>
            <li>I think I now get better shaves on trips than at home!  </li>
            <li>I now experience the most pleasant shaving experience of my life.</li>
            <li>It also is so slippery that it makes shaving a breeze because the razor can move nicely across my skin</li>
            <li>I also liked the cooling menthol and aloe (but others may not like it).  </li>
            <li>in all, a nice close shave with no nicks or irritation -</li>
            <li>Once applied it has a nice cooling feel as it readies your stubble for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find it through the Amazon vendor.  </li>
            <li>You can get a nice, close shave with it.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of nice.</li>
            <li>Also the menthol gives a nice feel to the face and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice scent, too.  </li>
            <li>: shave with warm water and then use an ice cube against your skin.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, cooling menthol kind of feels like that - like rubbing an ice cube on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, you notice it has a VERY STRONG SMELL.  </li>
            <li>but the smell is very strong menthol.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving product I have used in over 30 years of shaving.</li>
            <li>I kind of miss being able to see where I have already shaved..</li>
            <li>As good as anything on the market - easy to use no fuss -  it works and the price is OK</li>
            <li>--you don&#x27;t need it for a good shave--and this product gives you a great, close shave (assuming your shaver is good and sharp).  </li>
            <li>This is a good shave gel, but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>When I switched to this shave gel I loved it, it is smooth as in easy to glide my triple blade razor over,( I shave in the shower)</li>
            <li>Cartridge Shaver:  If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington&#x27;s own (which I don&#x27;t recommend) then this is a very good gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and here is why.  </li>
            <li>From now on I will not be purchasing overpriced women&#x27;s products and will instead keep using this because I like it better.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is just okay.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s all and good, but is it worth paying a premium price for it?</li>
            <li>I do like the menthol better..</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried using a shaving brush to create more foam</li>
            <li>Most \\&quot;gel\\&quot; shaving creams turn into foam upon application.  </li>
            <li>It can be used with Remington&#x27;s Azor 5 blade razor or even your favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>Both gels effectively soften whiskers and smooth my razor&#x27;s glide.  </li>
            <li>and I most definitely approve. :D  </li>
            <li>People can come at shave lubricants from many standpoints.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>(it does smell better than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The disposable GoodNews was interesting.</li>
            <li>The shave is just as close as with Alphagel, but with slightly more razor burn.</li>
            <li>It may not be for everyone, but for me it is the end of my search for a better shave gel.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better.</li>
            <li>I cant say I love it</li>
            <li>In the summer the cooling menthol would feel really refreshing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Reading many reviews across Amazon, it seemed that people were swearing by KING OF SHAVES brand shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my tube, it did not have the Remington label across the top.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my tube, it did not have the Remington label across the top.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice cool feeling after.</li>
            <li>Hot water and a good towel will wash it away.</li>
            <li>This product gives you an excellent close shave with minimal razor burn, but it puts more wear and tear on the razor.</li>
            <li>more interesting is the consistency and slickness of this gel - much slicker than i imagined - and i was able to shave without even wetting my face!</li>
            <li>Please reformulate the plastic in the top to give it a little more durability on impact and you&#x27;ll have a PERFECT product!</li>
            <li>When I use this with cartridge razors, I only need one pass to get an incredibly close shave, but then I get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I use a wet electric shaver in the shower, and this is the absolutely best shave</li>
            <li>However, I quickly got past that, as this pleasant cooling gel felt good on my face and nicely added welcome levels of moisturizing and lubrication to the whole shaving process.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, aside from getting used to that very powerful odor, and not being able to see where it is on your face, I will be buying this again.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice sent that seems natural.  </li>
            <li>this is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Never a bad shave when I use Alphagel, no kidding!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t miss the foam because it is easy to feel where the gel is.  </li>
            <li>The lack of foam makes it easy to see where I&#x27;m shaving, while the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; keeps my razor moving along with no burn.</li>
            <li>Gel leaves a sticky feeling and does not rinse away easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Gums up between blades and does not rinse away easily.</li>
            <li>However, the menthol smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>The menthol smell is incredibly strong and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>This one, however, delivers a _strong_ menthol smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent for keeping irritation down and shaving easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey guys, you like a cool, refreshing experience when you shave?</li>
            <li>The razor glides right over your face leaving a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it does work nicely in creating a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The gel helps glide the razor for a smooth shave with no irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Skin is smooth &amp;</li>
            <li>I saw the green menthol and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best ever.</li>
            <li>It used to be available at Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you who enjoy your electric razors are going to be amazed at the results you receive with KING OF SHAVES.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you who enjoy your electric razors are going to be amazed at the results you receive with KING OF SHAVES.  </li>
            <li>No rash and smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If you like menthol, this is a good gel to choose; otherwise, try the Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean passes with almost no razor burn.</li>
            <li>The menthol is pretty strong and makes the shave cool and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Now it appears that the original manufacturer has sold out to this company.  </li>
            <li>Now it appears that the original manufacturer has sold out to this company.  </li>
            <li>The shaver was now getting really close and way more comfortable.</li>
            <li>You have to tap it on sing repeatedly to get it clean.</li>
            <li>This Remington king of shaves alpha gel produces a really smooth shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for shaving improvements and Alphagel has been one of the most unexpected, enjoyable shaving surprises I&#x27;ve received in years.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this too and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave with a Glide razor and my face feels better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather and give almost no cushion for more exposed blades.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the menthol, feels cool against the skin.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 2)]] leaves a pleasant, fresh smell (a key component of which is melaleuca...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly, it sticks well onto the area of skin that it is applied to.</li>
            <li>At first I tried the new shaver dry shaving over the sink and it was marginal at best with my beard.  </li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised to find that it indeed not only works great, but is MUCH more economical in spite of the higher price upfront.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say this is a pretty fantastic shave gel.</li>
            <li>Remington Alphagel cooling menthol is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>About a quarter size will do a whole leg easy.  </li>
            <li>For a long time now, the &amp;#34;King-of-Shaves&amp;#34; gel has been the best product on the market for using with standard multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>so you get great glide with little to no pull.  </li>
            <li>I did not get any cuts, but I rarely get cuts during shaving.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the premium?</li>
            <li>I have the quality of at least as good as a blade shave and way more comfort.  </li>
            <li>The smell is rather medicinal, and I&#x27;d have to make sure to wash this off my face completely after use as I have no interest in smelling like this product when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>The Alphagel offers a &#x27;cooling&#x27; menthol additive, some users may find it refreshing</li>
            <li>The Braun 7 series may be another worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for DE shaving, it just doesn&#x27;t match the many Proraso, Omega, or Taylor of Old Bond products offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It does not foam up very good, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake with gel as much and taps out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of two products I would normally use and get equal or better results with just one tube of KING OF SHAVES.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of two products I would normally use and get equal or better results with just one tube of KING OF SHAVES.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a splash of water from the shower won&#x27;t rinse it right off)</li>
            <li>Try freeze your face right off menthol.  </li>
            <li>The smell for an unfragranced product is VERY strong, almost equal in strength to Vicks VaporRub.</li>
            <li>Before trying the Alphagel Shave Gel Cooling Menthol, I had previous tried the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; version (the blue gel) which I called the best shaving experience I have ever had with a gel or foam.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this in that it is a more efficient way to shave your face than the more traditional foams and gels.</li>
            <li>As of this time, I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tube of Menthol and Cool</li>
            <li>&quot; I can get a much closer shave and it leaves my face cool and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!)</li>
            <li>The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing scent is not too strong and it rinses easily, which surprised me because other gels I have used did not.</li>
            <li>Once I learned that I only need to use about a nickel&#x27;s worth (size) of gel for a shave, the smell became much more bearable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see how much is left in the container...nice to be in control of how much you pour into your hand...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I definitely recommend it for a comfortable, clean shave.</li>
            <li>So if you are a typical guy who doesn&#x27;t like all those strong \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot;, then you will love it.  </li>
            <li>And your skin does feel quite smooth and soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>Husband reported back: the gel is just OK.</li>
            <li>It makes his shave go so smoothly and leaves his skin conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li>The menthol scent is crisp and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I get a really close shave with absolutely no skin</li>
            <li>Without the lather you can see exactly where to shave.</li>
            <li>But, this stuff worked pretty well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to make sure that I put it on everywhere, as well as double check places I&#x27;d shaved.  </li>
            <li>It lubricates my skin and makes shaving pretty effortless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stickier than shaving cream, and not as water-soluble, so you cannot just run it under hot water.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s only marginally better than Lubriderm.</li>
            <li>they bill the low foaming as a feature when shaving around goatees and sideburns, most of my friends that have this sort of concern use an electric</li>
            <li>It gives the same smooth shave as the blue kind</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t expect much, particularly because I have easily irritated skin that feels dried out after using most shaving products.</li>
            <li>There is a weird mint smell (despite claiming to be fragrance free) but it is worth it for a shave this good.</li>
            <li>It was as effective as my previous shaving creams at both day-to-day and longer-periods in-between shaves.</li>
            <li>Especially during the shave, it can be a bit much - so strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really become accustomed to shaving with a pure \\&quot;gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The gel probably goes a little heavy on the menthol, but it is probably the best shave gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get a good shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>I still use an after-shave balm out of habit, although with this, it feels like I don&#x27;t really need to.  </li>
            <li>Since this gel doesn&#x27;t create much foam (the foam it does create dissolves in a minute or two)</li>
            <li>One really likes it and claims he will never return to aerosol cans.</li>
            <li>Who wants to find themselves on an extended vacation with a canister that ran out after one use?</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like/know this smell, you may find it unusual).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased a braun 3 series wet electric shaver, and added the Remington King of Shaves alphagel to the purchase more as an after thought, but what a difference.  </li>
            <li>It taps out much easier.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave on my cactus-like beard.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It shaves really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t need much of this stuff, so a tube goes a loooong way.  </li>
            <li>All I can tell you is that the skin is so perfectly smooth, that I find myself rubbing my hand across my face several times a day just to marvel at the softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to the cooling Menthol</li>
            <li>The cooling menthol really works.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a real pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - unless you absolutely must shave under piles of foam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of high end shaving creams that need to be applied with a shaving brush thinking they would be better, but even when applied with a very high quality shaving brush, they leave me with nicks and slightly razor burned skin.   </li>
            <li>The other thought that while the shaving gel has a refreshing smell and seems to be healthy for the skin, it doesn&#x27;t lather enough and is similar to just using soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised when I first used the Remington Gel it as it doesn&#x27;t foam up as Edge Gel does, but it works just as well and perhaps makes shaving a bit easier since you not having to deal with foam getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet on this shave gel.</li>
            <li>lubricant, I use a basic Gillette Custom Plus Pivot (a grandiose name for a two bladed, pivoting head disposable razor) and I want my shave cream/gel to provide an adequate level of lubricant so that I do not get razor burn, most basic creams do this well for me, the Alphagel works very well in this respect&lt;br /&gt;2) visual marker</li>
            <li>I see shave cream/gel as having two main purposes in order of importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Yes, I do have to pay a little more attention to where on my face</li>
            <li>My girlfriend noticed how much closer it was as compared to my old Edge gel without me asking.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Sensitive Skin version over this one because I don&#x27;t care for menthol that much.  </li>
            <li>The King of Shaves costs noticeably more but has the advantage of not being as messy of a shave as foams/creams, and you can see where you are shaving instead of shaving foam.</li>
            <li>The green Cooling Menthol is actually better.  </li>
            <li>nice that the lather isn&#x27;t too thick to obstruct your view of what you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li>I got a tube of this stuff because it was on clearance at the grocery store, and I like to try new things.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch it up a bit and try some new products.</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to shaving rashes, and I&#x27;m always trying new shaving gels, creams, and foams.</li>
            <li>Even the most experience wet shaver is likely to nick themselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cleans up easily so you aren&#x27;t stuck with a goopy mess on your face that you have to try and scrape off after the shave.  </li>
            <li>as far as the shave.. seems normal.</li>
            <li>It works great with a small amount, and this tube will be lasting a VERY long time.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon because it is becoming harder to find in our local stores here in Nebraska.  </li>
            <li>Even the menthol, which I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like (thanks to a bad childhood experience with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on a particularly sensitive area), feels great on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes on rather clear.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to stronger smells or menthol products, you should probably not use this one.</li>
            <li>B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li>B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it to a traditional shaving \\&quot;cream.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaving gel off and on for several months and really like it.</li>
            <li>if you wait a minute and then gently touch the foam, all the bubbles dissapate and there&#x27;s nothing left on your skin!  </li>
            <li>Edge Sensitive Skin Shave Gel for Men]].</li>
            <li>Must tap frequently to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, also it has tea tree a natural antiseptic, that I already use in shampoos to control my dandruff.</li>
            <li>Once you learn how much to apply, the tube will last a lot longer than you would think by looking at it.</li>
            <li>Once you get it going, it lathers pretty well, but it still seemed strange to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and like it very much so far.</li>
            <li>have also tried Nivea for Men, Sensitive, Shaving Foam.</li>
            <li>Close shave, far fewer nicks, and seems like improved blade life as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, if Remington could work on this product a bit more and tone down the unpleasant scent (and I found a good deal on it)</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the bottle isn&#x27;t really full and you can go through one fairly quickly if you shave every day like I do.</li>
            <li>Creams don&#x27;t hold up to the water, but this is extremely slick and my shaver glides so easily with it.</li>
            <li>This manufacturer has several other types of gels available that are not menthol.</li>
            <li>the most, I have enjoyed my dry shaves with the electric razor, though once in a while I can get a little bit of razor burn which can be common with these types of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular gel only offers the mildest of cooling effects.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and this shave gel rinses away cleanly with a few splashes of water after you&#x27;re done shaving.  </li>
            <li>but there is even less irritation when you use the green kind.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing Icy Hot all over your face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t need much (which is good, because it&#x27;s not very cheap) - just enough to cover a half dollar or less for me.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and makes for a smooth glide with your razor.  </li>
            <li>So essentially your getting the same product as your father did years ago in a fancier bottle at a high price.  </li>
            <li>The gel stays clear so you can actually see what your shaving.  </li>
            <li>But its so slick my Derby sharpness is partially nullified, so I&#x27;m glad I got this two pack for $6.  </li>
            <li>It works well, and I think a lot of people would really like it, I just seem to have a mental block about it.</li>
            <li>The shave was clean, took fewer passes, and there was considerably less dry skin and razor</li>
            <li>So I filled a small, plastic 1-oz bottle with this product and it worked like a champ!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 12 years, bringing back to the USA with me from the UK when traveling, originally it was just King of Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;1 tube lasts me over 6 months, if you use with shaving brush you need very little per shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slick</li>
            <li>My razor never gets gunked up with shaving cream, so shaving requires less rinsing and is much faster, and this gel never drips or runs the way foam does, so there&#x27;s absolutely no mess.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a wet shaver using either straight razors or double edged safety razors</li>
            <li>I did not find the fragrance overwhelming or even very noticeable as another reviewer mentioned -- I just don&#x27;t care for menthol because it gives a cold, tingly feel.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear and stays clear, unlike other gels that lather on contact.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>i have never used a shave gel before, so it was fun to try this menthol gel; i usually prefer a bay rum or lime-based scent, but the menthol was not objectionable...</li>
            <li>Even though I read on the package about the low foam part and use a small amount, it took me a few shaves to get used to the idea that you don&#x27;t need to lather up a Santa beard in order to shave :)  </li>
            <li>You can feel the cooling menthol on your skin even before you start shaving, especially during the first few shaves after you open the container.</li>
            <li>The cooling menthol is a little too much for my skin, but if you like that sensation, it certinely lives up to its name.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> :D</li>
            <li> Great price too!</li>
            <li> This shave gel is the best stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by this product and would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the shaves are great!</li>
            <li> Now using this product is the best shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li> and I am very impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> One of the best shaves/gel out there.  </li>
            <li> But Alphagel is very good, so still deserves all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> excellent deal, great product.  </li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I got a real nice shave - I&#x27;m happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to find on Amazon and considering how wonderful it is, it&#x27;s a very fairly priced indulgence.</li>
            <li> Alphagel works great for leaving your face feeling moist after shaving.  </li>
            <li> LOL)</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Best shave product I have ever used- better than aerosol gels, foam, or any creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because this gel is great!</li>
            <li> But with this product, I was extremely pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond that, I won&#x27;t argue if the cream has a pleasant smell and added skin benefits like aloe.</li>
            <li> this product is excellent and make shaving a true joy.  </li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the aerosol ones, how it clung to his face after he shaved.</li>
            <li> A side benefit, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;It does FEEL good on the skin - it tingles - sort of wakes you up</li>
            <li> Almost none with a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And Lubriderm is 99% as good, is cheaper than Alphagel, and is easier on the razor.</li>
            <li> I like gels and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, good product, I&#x27;d use it again.</li>
            <li> My guess is that they are not out to ruin a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My guess is that they are not out to ruin a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brother told me that was a good tip by the way</li>
            <li> I recommend that one if you want a good smelling foam.</li>
            <li> When the original King of Shaves won the award from the Magazine For Him for best shave gel, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;From a woman&#x27;s point of view, the smell is very appealing</li>
            <li> If not, the more affordable shave creams can get the job done too!</li>
            <li> I think I now get better shaves on trips than at home!  </li>
            <li> I now experience the most pleasant shaving experience of my life.</li>
            <li> It also is so slippery that it makes shaving a breeze because the razor can move nicely across my skin</li>
            <li> I also liked the cooling menthol and aloe (but others may not like it).  </li>
            <li> in all, a nice close shave with no nicks or irritation -</li>
            <li> Once applied it has a nice cooling feel as it readies your stubble for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find it through the Amazon vendor.  </li>
            <li> You can get a nice, close shave with it.  </li>
            <li> Its kind of nice.</li>
            <li> Also the menthol gives a nice feel to the face and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice scent, too.  </li>
            <li> : shave with warm water and then use an ice cube against your skin.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, cooling menthol kind of feels like that - like rubbing an ice cube on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, you notice it has a VERY STRONG SMELL.  </li>
            <li> but the smell is very strong menthol.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving product I have used in over 30 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> I kind of miss being able to see where I have already shaved..</li>
            <li> As good as anything on the market - easy to use no fuss -  it works and the price is OK</li>
            <li> --you don&#x27;t need it for a good shave--and this product gives you a great, close shave (assuming your shaver is good and sharp).  </li>
            <li> This is a good shave gel, but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> When I switched to this shave gel I loved it, it is smooth as in easy to glide my triple blade razor over,( I shave in the shower)</li>
            <li> Cartridge Shaver:  If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington&#x27;s own (which I don&#x27;t recommend) then this is a very good gel.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and here is why.  </li>
            <li> From now on I will not be purchasing overpriced women&#x27;s products and will instead keep using this because I like it better.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is just okay.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s all and good, but is it worth paying a premium price for it?</li>
            <li> I do like the menthol better..</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried using a shaving brush to create more foam</li>
            <li> Most \\&quot;gel\\&quot; shaving creams turn into foam upon application.  </li>
            <li> It can be used with Remington&#x27;s Azor 5 blade razor or even your favorite brand.  </li>
            <li> Both gels effectively soften whiskers and smooth my razor&#x27;s glide.  </li>
            <li> and I most definitely approve. :D  </li>
            <li> People can come at shave lubricants from many standpoints.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> (it does smell better than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The disposable GoodNews was interesting.</li>
            <li> The shave is just as close as with Alphagel, but with slightly more razor burn.</li>
            <li> It may not be for everyone, but for me it is the end of my search for a better shave gel.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better.</li>
            <li> I cant say I love it</li>
            <li> In the summer the cooling menthol would feel really refreshing.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Reading many reviews across Amazon, it seemed that people were swearing by KING OF SHAVES brand shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my tube, it did not have the Remington label across the top.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my tube, it did not have the Remington label across the top.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice cool feeling after.</li>
            <li> Hot water and a good towel will wash it away.</li>
            <li> This product gives you an excellent close shave with minimal razor burn, but it puts more wear and tear on the razor.</li>
            <li> more interesting is the consistency and slickness of this gel - much slicker than i imagined - and i was able to shave without even wetting my face!</li>
            <li> Please reformulate the plastic in the top to give it a little more durability on impact and you&#x27;ll have a PERFECT product!</li>
            <li> When I use this with cartridge razors, I only need one pass to get an incredibly close shave, but then I get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I use a wet electric shaver in the shower, and this is the absolutely best shave</li>
            <li> However, I quickly got past that, as this pleasant cooling gel felt good on my face and nicely added welcome levels of moisturizing and lubrication to the whole shaving process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, aside from getting used to that very powerful odor, and not being able to see where it is on your face, I will be buying this again.  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice sent that seems natural.  </li>
            <li> this is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Never a bad shave when I use Alphagel, no kidding!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t miss the foam because it is easy to feel where the gel is.  </li>
            <li> The lack of foam makes it easy to see where I&#x27;m shaving, while the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; keeps my razor moving along with no burn.</li>
            <li> Gel leaves a sticky feeling and does not rinse away easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Gums up between blades and does not rinse away easily.</li>
            <li> However, the menthol smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> The menthol smell is incredibly strong and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This one, however, delivers a _strong_ menthol smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent for keeping irritation down and shaving easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey guys, you like a cool, refreshing experience when you shave?</li>
            <li> The razor glides right over your face leaving a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it does work nicely in creating a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The gel helps glide the razor for a smooth shave with no irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Skin is smooth &amp;</li>
            <li> I saw the green menthol and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best ever.</li>
            <li> It used to be available at Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you who enjoy your electric razors are going to be amazed at the results you receive with KING OF SHAVES.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you who enjoy your electric razors are going to be amazed at the results you receive with KING OF SHAVES.  </li>
            <li> No rash and smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If you like menthol, this is a good gel to choose; otherwise, try the Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth clean passes with almost no razor burn.</li>
            <li> The menthol is pretty strong and makes the shave cool and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Now it appears that the original manufacturer has sold out to this company.  </li>
            <li> Now it appears that the original manufacturer has sold out to this company.  </li>
            <li> The shaver was now getting really close and way more comfortable.</li>
            <li> You have to tap it on sing repeatedly to get it clean.</li>
            <li> This Remington king of shaves alpha gel produces a really smooth shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for shaving improvements and Alphagel has been one of the most unexpected, enjoyable shaving surprises I&#x27;ve received in years.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this too and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave with a Glide razor and my face feels better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lather and give almost no cushion for more exposed blades.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the menthol, feels cool against the skin.</li>
            <li> (Pack of 2)]] leaves a pleasant, fresh smell (a key component of which is melaleuca...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly, it sticks well onto the area of skin that it is applied to.</li>
            <li> At first I tried the new shaver dry shaving over the sink and it was marginal at best with my beard.  </li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised to find that it indeed not only works great, but is MUCH more economical in spite of the higher price upfront.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say this is a pretty fantastic shave gel.</li>
            <li> Remington Alphagel cooling menthol is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> About a quarter size will do a whole leg easy.  </li>
            <li> For a long time now, the &amp;#34;King-of-Shaves&amp;#34; gel has been the best product on the market for using with standard multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li> so you get great glide with little to no pull.  </li>
            <li> I did not get any cuts, but I rarely get cuts during shaving.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the premium?</li>
            <li> I have the quality of at least as good as a blade shave and way more comfort.  </li>
            <li> The smell is rather medicinal, and I&#x27;d have to make sure to wash this off my face completely after use as I have no interest in smelling like this product when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> The Alphagel offers a &#x27;cooling&#x27; menthol additive, some users may find it refreshing</li>
            <li> The Braun 7 series may be another worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for DE shaving, it just doesn&#x27;t match the many Proraso, Omega, or Taylor of Old Bond products offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It does not foam up very good, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake with gel as much and taps out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of two products I would normally use and get equal or better results with just one tube of KING OF SHAVES.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of two products I would normally use and get equal or better results with just one tube of KING OF SHAVES.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a splash of water from the shower won&#x27;t rinse it right off)</li>
            <li> Try freeze your face right off menthol.  </li>
            <li> The smell for an unfragranced product is VERY strong, almost equal in strength to Vicks VaporRub.</li>
            <li> Before trying the Alphagel Shave Gel Cooling Menthol, I had previous tried the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; version (the blue gel) which I called the best shaving experience I have ever had with a gel or foam.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this in that it is a more efficient way to shave your face than the more traditional foams and gels.</li>
            <li> As of this time, I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tube of Menthol and Cool</li>
            <li> &quot; I can get a much closer shave and it leaves my face cool and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!)</li>
            <li> The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing scent is not too strong and it rinses easily, which surprised me because other gels I have used did not.</li>
            <li> Once I learned that I only need to use about a nickel&#x27;s worth (size) of gel for a shave, the smell became much more bearable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to see how much is left in the container...nice to be in control of how much you pour into your hand...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I definitely recommend it for a comfortable, clean shave.</li>
            <li> So if you are a typical guy who doesn&#x27;t like all those strong \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot;, then you will love it.  </li>
            <li> And your skin does feel quite smooth and soft after shaving.</li>
            <li> Husband reported back: the gel is just OK.</li>
            <li> It makes his shave go so smoothly and leaves his skin conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li> The menthol scent is crisp and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I get a really close shave with absolutely no skin</li>
            <li> Without the lather you can see exactly where to shave.</li>
            <li> But, this stuff worked pretty well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to make sure that I put it on everywhere, as well as double check places I&#x27;d shaved.  </li>
            <li> It lubricates my skin and makes shaving pretty effortless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stickier than shaving cream, and not as water-soluble, so you cannot just run it under hot water.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only marginally better than Lubriderm.</li>
            <li> they bill the low foaming as a feature when shaving around goatees and sideburns, most of my friends that have this sort of concern use an electric</li>
            <li> It gives the same smooth shave as the blue kind</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t expect much, particularly because I have easily irritated skin that feels dried out after using most shaving products.</li>
            <li> There is a weird mint smell (despite claiming to be fragrance free) but it is worth it for a shave this good.</li>
            <li> It was as effective as my previous shaving creams at both day-to-day and longer-periods in-between shaves.</li>
            <li> Especially during the shave, it can be a bit much - so strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really become accustomed to shaving with a pure \\&quot;gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The gel probably goes a little heavy on the menthol, but it is probably the best shave gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get a good shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> I still use an after-shave balm out of habit, although with this, it feels like I don&#x27;t really need to.  </li>
            <li> Since this gel doesn&#x27;t create much foam (the foam it does create dissolves in a minute or two)</li>
            <li> One really likes it and claims he will never return to aerosol cans.</li>
            <li> Who wants to find themselves on an extended vacation with a canister that ran out after one use?</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like/know this smell, you may find it unusual).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased a braun 3 series wet electric shaver, and added the Remington King of Shaves alphagel to the purchase more as an after thought, but what a difference.  </li>
            <li> It taps out much easier.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave on my cactus-like beard.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It shaves really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much of this stuff, so a tube goes a loooong way.  </li>
            <li> All I can tell you is that the skin is so perfectly smooth, that I find myself rubbing my hand across my face several times a day just to marvel at the softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to the cooling Menthol</li>
            <li> The cooling menthol really works.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a real pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - unless you absolutely must shave under piles of foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of high end shaving creams that need to be applied with a shaving brush thinking they would be better, but even when applied with a very high quality shaving brush, they leave me with nicks and slightly razor burned skin.   </li>
            <li> The other thought that while the shaving gel has a refreshing smell and seems to be healthy for the skin, it doesn&#x27;t lather enough and is similar to just using soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised when I first used the Remington Gel it as it doesn&#x27;t foam up as Edge Gel does, but it works just as well and perhaps makes shaving a bit easier since you not having to deal with foam getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet on this shave gel.</li>
            <li> lubricant, I use a basic Gillette Custom Plus Pivot (a grandiose name for a two bladed, pivoting head disposable razor) and I want my shave cream/gel to provide an adequate level of lubricant so that I do not get razor burn, most basic creams do this well for me, the Alphagel works very well in this respect&lt;br /&gt;2) visual marker</li>
            <li> I see shave cream/gel as having two main purposes in order of importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Yes, I do have to pay a little more attention to where on my face</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noticed how much closer it was as compared to my old Edge gel without me asking.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Sensitive Skin version over this one because I don&#x27;t care for menthol that much.  </li>
            <li> The King of Shaves costs noticeably more but has the advantage of not being as messy of a shave as foams/creams, and you can see where you are shaving instead of shaving foam.</li>
            <li> The green Cooling Menthol is actually better.  </li>
            <li> nice that the lather isn&#x27;t too thick to obstruct your view of what you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li> I got a tube of this stuff because it was on clearance at the grocery store, and I like to try new things.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch it up a bit and try some new products.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to shaving rashes, and I&#x27;m always trying new shaving gels, creams, and foams.</li>
            <li> Even the most experience wet shaver is likely to nick themselves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cleans up easily so you aren&#x27;t stuck with a goopy mess on your face that you have to try and scrape off after the shave.  </li>
            <li> as far as the shave.. seems normal.</li>
            <li> It works great with a small amount, and this tube will be lasting a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon because it is becoming harder to find in our local stores here in Nebraska.  </li>
            <li> Even the menthol, which I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like (thanks to a bad childhood experience with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on a particularly sensitive area), feels great on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes on rather clear.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to stronger smells or menthol products, you should probably not use this one.</li>
            <li> B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li> B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it to a traditional shaving \\&quot;cream.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving gel off and on for several months and really like it.</li>
            <li> if you wait a minute and then gently touch the foam, all the bubbles dissapate and there&#x27;s nothing left on your skin!  </li>
            <li> Edge Sensitive Skin Shave Gel for Men]].</li>
            <li> Must tap frequently to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , also it has tea tree a natural antiseptic, that I already use in shampoos to control my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how much to apply, the tube will last a lot longer than you would think by looking at it.</li>
            <li> Once you get it going, it lathers pretty well, but it still seemed strange to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and like it very much so far.</li>
            <li> have also tried Nivea for Men, Sensitive, Shaving Foam.</li>
            <li> Close shave, far fewer nicks, and seems like improved blade life as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, if Remington could work on this product a bit more and tone down the unpleasant scent (and I found a good deal on it)</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bottle isn&#x27;t really full and you can go through one fairly quickly if you shave every day like I do.</li>
            <li> Creams don&#x27;t hold up to the water, but this is extremely slick and my shaver glides so easily with it.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer has several other types of gels available that are not menthol.</li>
            <li> the most, I have enjoyed my dry shaves with the electric razor, though once in a while I can get a little bit of razor burn which can be common with these types of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular gel only offers the mildest of cooling effects.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and this shave gel rinses away cleanly with a few splashes of water after you&#x27;re done shaving.  </li>
            <li> but there is even less irritation when you use the green kind.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like rubbing Icy Hot all over your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much (which is good, because it&#x27;s not very cheap) - just enough to cover a half dollar or less for me.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and makes for a smooth glide with your razor.  </li>
            <li> So essentially your getting the same product as your father did years ago in a fancier bottle at a high price.  </li>
            <li> The gel stays clear so you can actually see what your shaving.  </li>
            <li> But its so slick my Derby sharpness is partially nullified, so I&#x27;m glad I got this two pack for $6.  </li>
            <li> It works well, and I think a lot of people would really like it, I just seem to have a mental block about it.</li>
            <li> The shave was clean, took fewer passes, and there was considerably less dry skin and razor</li>
            <li> So I filled a small, plastic 1-oz bottle with this product and it worked like a champ!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 12 years, bringing back to the USA with me from the UK when traveling, originally it was just King of Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;1 tube lasts me over 6 months, if you use with shaving brush you need very little per shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super slick</li>
            <li> My razor never gets gunked up with shaving cream, so shaving requires less rinsing and is much faster, and this gel never drips or runs the way foam does, so there&#x27;s absolutely no mess.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a wet shaver using either straight razors or double edged safety razors</li>
            <li> I did not find the fragrance overwhelming or even very noticeable as another reviewer mentioned -- I just don&#x27;t care for menthol because it gives a cold, tingly feel.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear and stays clear, unlike other gels that lather on contact.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> i have never used a shave gel before, so it was fun to try this menthol gel; i usually prefer a bay rum or lime-based scent, but the menthol was not objectionable...</li>
            <li> Even though I read on the package about the low foam part and use a small amount, it took me a few shaves to get used to the idea that you don&#x27;t need to lather up a Santa beard in order to shave :)  </li>
            <li> You can feel the cooling menthol on your skin even before you start shaving, especially during the first few shaves after you open the container.</li>
            <li> The cooling menthol is a little too much for my skin, but if you like that sensation, it certinely lives up to its name.  </li>
            <li> this is unusual for me, as i cannot even use regular double- or triple-bladed razors due to the thickness/toughness of my beard (i use a straight razor); one caution: you will need to do a thorough rinse after your shave - this gel provides enough persistent lubrication to take you through at least two passes - a definite advantageous feature!</li>
            <li> A little aftershave cools it right down.</li>
            <li> The near-zero foaming was a little strange at first, but now I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam which is both positive and negative.</li>
            <li> any case, my normal routine for the past two years has been essentially using the electric razor dry.  </li>
            <li> Although I am not sure if shaving gel foams or not really makes much of a difference either way.</li>
            <li> Traditional \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li> One can get the standard creams and gels for two bucks or less at various brick and mortar stores if you pay attention to their weekly ads.</li>
            <li> My wet shave is even CLOSER than it was when I used it dry if something like that is possible.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is it is more expensive than the other products.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel took a little getting used to, as it doesn&#x27;t foam up to look like regular shaving cream, and I like regular white-colored shaving cream because it allows you to see- as you scrape it off with your blade- where on your face you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Skin isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> advantage of using this gel with an electric razor is like night and day over dry.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never want to shave dry again.ks to the cooling Menthol, I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, either.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never want to shave dry again.</li>
            <li> And if you want to do a little \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; you&#x27;ll have similar results.</li>
            <li> time, you just splash a little water on your face and you can still feel the gel there.bit tougher to rinse off my blade, but overall I like it quite a lot and will be buying this stuff going forward.  </li>
            <li> B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel]]), but the scent of this product is still is a negative.  </li>
            <li> And it is harder to see it since it is a gel and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of color to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for the heck of it, one day I decided to try a wet shave with my Panasonic electric razor</li>
            <li> (yes, you can use it wet).  </li>
            <li> I was overwhelmed by the smell of menthol and needed to be careful about placing &amp; using in sensitive areas, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and live in an apartment complex with very hard water</li>
            <li> In addition, with current pricing this product is about twice as expensive as Edge Gel, and I&#x27;m not sure this product is worth the cost</li>
            <li> , I want to know what parts of my face still require shaving, I often shave in less than bright light and use the cream still on my face as a place holder for what has and has not been shaved, the Alphagel fails this purpose miserably (note:</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This shaving gel does not foam at all, which distinguishes it from other shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other shaving gels that foam up on contact, but this gel doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The lack of foam took some getting used to, especially since I usually rely on it to show me where I&#x27;ve shaved and where I haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve gradually come to appreciate the benefits of a no-foam product.</li>
            <li> you will explore shaving other areas....</li>
            <li> I save small containers for refilling with larger products -- saving lots of money.  </li>
            <li> You simply put a small dab on your fingers, rub them together and then across your face and neck (after washing it with warm/hot water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> burn that I used to get with other foams and gels</li>
            <li> , it only takes a small amount when shaving.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I&#x27;ve never liked about shaving cream or even current gels, is after you put them on and they foam up,</li>
            <li> My skin actually feels smooth without that painful raw burning that comes from the excessive pressure needed for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Never having using gel to shave before, my husband was a bit hesitant to try this one out since he is used to the typical \\&quot;in the can\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li> The only real negative for me was the menthol, which, while not unbearably strong, is certainly impossible to ignore.</li>
            <li> There is no question this product has a lot of menthol and the first time you use it, your skin will be bedamned cold.  </li>
            <li> That was a little odd</li>
            <li> It also hangs tight (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but the concept of using something that looked so much like a gel and not cream to shave with seemed weird to me.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you see it as one of life&#x27;s little luxuries.</li>
            <li> Gone are the billowing clouds that give little to no protection to your skin.</li>
            <li> time, you just splash a little water on your face and you can still feel the gel there.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel dried out afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to address a few here.  </li>
            <li> I think its because the spacing between the blades is narrow.</li>
            <li> I have been using King of shaves for a few years now</li>
            <li> I feel that I get a closer shave less irritation and zero ingrown hairs while using this product!</li>
            <li> The Quattro and Fusion gums up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This product is hard on the reusable blades, so expect less life out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad ... just not recommended for large areas.</li>
            <li> It is very slick as previously mentioned but it was designed for cartridge use.  </li>
            <li> gel is a bit expensive, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t the most horrible shaving gel out there either.</li>
            <li> One problem with packing aerosols is it&#x27;s difficult to know when a travel size aerosol foam product is running low.</li>
            <li> nothing out of the ordinary.. accept that this is a gel and not a foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning to my usual shave cream.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I have gone from a blade razor over to an electric.  </li>
            <li> If the tube is dropped it will shatter and usually break the hinge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell where I&#x27;ve shaved</li>
            <li> I once tapped the Fusion so hard, the moisturizing strip fell off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not blade-cloggingly</li>
            <li> I apply it thickly.</li>
            <li> Instead, this product provides a thin layer of soothing protection between your skin and the razor.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s weird to use, because after you put it on, you can&#x27;t tell or see where you put it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see it once it&#x27;s on your skin, so it makes shaving really weird.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is still a residual stickiness after the shave, which is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , I find it just shy of uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not overly crazy about the shaving gel</li>
            <li> He is absolutely crazy about it now.  </li>
            <li> but maybe im doing this wrong?!?</li>
            <li> I guess some people might like that it doesn&#x27;t foam, but without the foam, I end up with a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> Well, let&#x27;s just say bad idea.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, though.  </li>
            <li> If you hate menthol, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I hate these.</li>
            <li> : I get terrible razor burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried -</li>

            <li> I love this stuff and here is why.  A little bit goes a long way.  About a quarter size will do a whole leg easy.  It also is so slippery that it makes shaving a breeze because the razor can move nicely across my skin and I get a closer shave with it than I do with a women&#x27;s shaving foam.  It also hangs tight (a splash of water from the shower won&#x27;t rinse it right off) so that you can get the job done.  I don&#x27;t miss the foam because it is easy to feel where the gel is.  I love the smell of this too and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed. From now on I will not be purchasing overpriced women&#x27;s products and will instead keep using this because I like it better.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is awful.  I guess some people might like that it doesn&#x27;t foam, but without the foam, I end up with a bad shave.  Also, \\&quot;cooling menthol\\&quot;?  Try freeze your face right off menthol.  It&#x27;s like rubbing Icy Hot all over your face.  Definitely will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is just okay. On the positive side, it does work nicely in creating a smooth shave. It doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly, it sticks well onto the area of skin that it is applied to. And your skin does feel quite smooth and soft after shaving. However, the menthol smell is quite strong. So if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to stronger smells or menthol products, you should probably not use this one. And it is harder to see it since it is a gel and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of color to it. So I&#x27;m not overly crazy about the shaving gel but it isn&#x27;t the most horrible shaving gel out there either.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this in that it is a more efficient way to shave your face than the more traditional foams and gels. Even though I read on the package about the low foam part and use a small amount, it took me a few shaves to get used to the idea that you don&#x27;t need to lather up a Santa beard in order to shave :)  I used this with the same 3-blade razor blade system I was using before. It was as effective as my previous shaving creams at both day-to-day and longer-periods in-between shaves. I did not get any cuts, but I rarely get cuts during shaving.  You can feel the cooling menthol on your skin even before you start shaving, especially during the first few shaves after you open the container. I still use an after-shave balm out of habit, although with this, it feels like I don&#x27;t really need to.  So that&#x27;s all and good, but is it worth paying a premium price for it? One can get the standard creams and gels for two bucks or less at various brick and mortar stores if you pay attention to their weekly ads. The King of Shaves costs noticeably more but has the advantage of not being as messy of a shave as foams/creams, and you can see where you are shaving instead of shaving foam. I also liked the cooling menthol and aloe (but others may not like it).  Is it worth the premium? Maybe if you see it as one of life&#x27;s little luxuries. If not, the more affordable shave creams can get the job done too!</li>
            <li> Husband reported back: the gel is just OK. It doesn&#x27;t foam which is both positive and negative. The smell for an unfragranced product is VERY strong, almost equal in strength to Vicks VaporRub. It does deliver on the cooling effect promise though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, he wouldn&#x27;t choose this gel over what he is using now - Gillette shaving foam.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I tried this product on my legs. Well, let&#x27;s just say bad idea. I was overwhelmed by the smell of menthol and needed to be careful about placing &amp; using in sensitive areas, if you know what I mean. Overall, I prefer to stick with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad ... just not recommended for large areas.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend LOVES this stuff! It makes his shave go so smoothly and leaves his skin conditioned and soft. When he uses this he doesn&#x27;t even have to use aftershave. Definitely can save you some money by buying only ONE product.</li>
            <li> As of this time, I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tube of Menthol and Cool and I&#x27;m forever done with \\&quot;EDGE\\&quot; gel foam and sticking with AlphaGel from now on.  I get a really close shave with a Glide razor and my face feels better.  I do like the menthol better.. perhaps its the tingly feeling....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts about a month.. or longer if you use it sparingly..  excellent deal, great product.  I would recommend without reservation to friends.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal: I&#x27;m a shaving soap guy. I use a bar and brush, and have been for years. I also use a double edge razor manufactured in the 60s, but that&#x27;s besides the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I didn&#x27;t expect much, particularly because I have easily irritated skin that feels dried out after using most shaving products. But with this product, I was extremely pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much (which is good, because it&#x27;s not very cheap) - just enough to cover a half dollar or less for me. It&#x27;s thick, but not blade-cloggingly so. Rub into beard and shave. The lack of foam makes it easy to see where I&#x27;m shaving, while the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; keeps my razor moving along with no burn. Even the menthol, which I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like (thanks to a bad childhood experience with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on a particularly sensitive area), feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice close shave with no nicks or irritation - and I don&#x27;t feel dried out afterwards. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found in quite a while that I&#x27;d consider using instead of shaving soap, and I can recommend it enthusiastically.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and live in an apartment complex with very hard water so it&#x27;s hard to get a good shave without razor burn. This is the only shaving cream/gel I&#x27;ve found that does both. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of high end shaving creams that need to be applied with a shaving brush thinking they would be better, but even when applied with a very high quality shaving brush, they leave me with nicks and slightly razor burned skin.   There are two downsides to this product. 1) The menthol smell is incredibly strong and takes some getting used to. Once I learned that I only need to use about a nickel&#x27;s worth (size) of gel for a shave, the smell became much more bearable. 2) Since this gel doesn&#x27;t create much foam (the foam it does create dissolves in a minute or two) it&#x27;s hard to tell where I&#x27;ve shaved so sometimes I&#x27;ll miss a spot (I&#x27;ve tried using a shaving brush to create more foam but it still dissolves shortly after being applied).   I use this product with a safety razor and do two passes to get a close shave. When I use this with cartridge razors, I only need one pass to get an incredibly close shave, but then I get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Alphagel works great for leaving your face feeling moist after shaving.  It has a very nice sent that seems natural.  This shaving gel does not foam at all, which distinguishes it from other shaving creams.  Although I am not sure if shaving gel foams or not really makes much of a difference either way.</li>
            <li> This was tried by two of my family members. One really likes it and claims he will never return to aerosol cans. The other thought that while the shaving gel has a refreshing smell and seems to be healthy for the skin, it doesn&#x27;t lather enough and is similar to just using soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re a traveling family and at 5 oz, it is just a spec too big for carry-on travel rules so you have to check it in your bag. One problem with packing aerosols is it&#x27;s difficult to know when a travel size aerosol foam product is running low. Who wants to find themselves on an extended vacation with a canister that ran out after one use? So, if you check a bag, you might consider switching to a \\&quot;shave gel\\&quot; and choose this one.</li>
            <li> Most \\&quot;gel\\&quot; shaving creams turn into foam upon application.  So essentially your getting the same product as your father did years ago in a fancier bottle at a high price.  But Remington&#x27;s Alphagel is very different.  It comes out of the tube as a gel and stays a gel.  Once applied it has a nice cooling feel as it readies your stubble for shaving.  The gel stays clear so you can actually see what your shaving.  The gel helps glide the razor for a smooth shave with no irritation afterwards.  I have used this for about a month and shaved with and against the grain and never once nicked myself.  It can be used with Remington&#x27;s Azor 5 blade razor or even your favorite brand.  Either was you will get the smoothest, non-irritating shave.  And if you want to do a little \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; you&#x27;ll have similar results.</li>
            <li> I quite like the [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] - a very similar product to this. Both gels effectively soften whiskers and smooth my razor&#x27;s glide.  The [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] leaves a pleasant, fresh smell (a key component of which is melaleuca...if you don&#x27;t like/know this smell, you may find it unusual). This one, however, delivers a _strong_ menthol smell. Especially during the shave, it can be a bit much - so strong that it&#x27;s bothered my eyes on occasion.  It&#x27;s nice to see how much is left in the container...nice to be in control of how much you pour into your hand...nice that the lather isn&#x27;t too thick to obstruct your view of what you&#x27;re shaving.  If you like \\&quot;cooling menthol,\\&quot; I have to think you&#x27;ll like this gel.</li>
            <li> As described, this is a low foam product. Gone are the billowing clouds that give little to no protection to your skin. Instead, this product provides a thin layer of soothing protection between your skin and the razor. The menthol scent is crisp and invigorating. My skin actually feels smooth without that painful raw burning that comes from the excessive pressure needed for a close shave. I highly recommend this product - unless you absolutely must shave under piles of foam.</li>
            <li> Never having using gel to shave before, my husband was a bit hesitant to try this one out since he is used to the typical \\&quot;in the can\\&quot; types. He was pleasantly surprised to find that it indeed not only works great, but is MUCH more economical in spite of the higher price upfront.  It does not foam up very good, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  It works great with a small amount, and this tube will be lasting a VERY long time. Excellent for keeping irritation down and shaving easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a woman&#x27;s point of view, the smell is very appealing and I most definitely approve. :D  I wish it was a bit stronger smelling, personally... I loved the smell of the aerosol ones, how it clung to his face after he shaved. This one is not as noticeable unless you get up close (no problems there! LOL) So if you are a typical guy who doesn&#x27;t like all those strong \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot;, then you will love it.  If you want the girls to cling to you, maybe try something else. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have the can... this is more environmentally friendly. 5 stars all around!</li>
            <li> People can come at shave lubricants from many standpoints.  I&#x27;ll try to address a few here.  Cartridge Shaver:  If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington&#x27;s own (which I don&#x27;t recommend) then this is a very good gel.  It&#x27;s super slick so you get great glide with little to no pull.  It&#x27;s also cleans up easily so you aren&#x27;t stuck with a goopy mess on your face that you have to try and scrape off after the shave.  All in all, it&#x27;s one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I&#x27;ve used. - 4 1/2 stars  Traditional \\&quot;Wet Shaver\\&quot;:  I&#x27;ve you&#x27;re a wet shaver using either straight razors or double edged safety razors I can&#x27;t really recommend this product.  It is very slick as previously mentioned but it was designed for cartridge use.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather and give almost no cushion for more exposed blades.  Even the most experience wet shaver is likely to nick themselves. - 2 stars  Menthol Addict Shaver:  Are you a menthol-head?  Is Osage Rub your go-to aftershave?  Do you expect face freezing blasts of menthol from your shaving creams/gels/soaps?  This is not for you.  This particular gel only offers the mildest of cooling effects.  Skip this one and go for some Proraso. - 1 star</li>
            <li> This product is great. I much prefer it to a traditional shaving \\&quot;cream.\\&quot; I can get a much closer shave and it leaves my face cool and moisturized. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving gel off and on for several months and really like it. I&#x27;ve had other shaving gels that foam up on contact, but this gel doesn&#x27;t. The lack of foam took some getting used to, especially since I usually rely on it to show me where I&#x27;ve shaved and where I haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve gradually come to appreciate the benefits of a no-foam product. My razor never gets gunked up with shaving cream, so shaving requires less rinsing and is much faster, and this gel never drips or runs the way foam does, so there&#x27;s absolutely no mess. Most importantly, I get a really close shave with absolutely no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is a bit expensive, but a little bit goes a long way. The only real negative for me was the menthol, which, while not unbearably strong, is certainly impossible to ignore. If you hate menthol, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it for a comfortable, clean shave.</li>
            <li> This shave gel is the best stuff. The razor glides right over your face leaving a nice clean shave. Leaves a nice cool feeling after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 12 years, bringing back to the USA with me from the UK when traveling, originally it was just King of Shaves.&lt;br /&gt;1 tube lasts me over 6 months, if you use with shaving brush you need very little per shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head as well my face for about 10 years now this product is excellent and make shaving a true joy.  I feel that I get a closer shave less irritation and zero ingrown hairs while using this product!</li>
            <li> I use a wet electric shaver in the shower, and this is the absolutely best shave cream/gel I&#x27;ve found.  Creams don&#x27;t hold up to the water, but this is extremely slick and my shaver glides so easily with it.</li>
            <li> Expecially if you shape your beard, or need to get close to a stash. Without the lather you can see exactly where to shave.</li>
            <li> Never a bad shave when I use Alphagel, no kidding!</li>
            <li> I just purchased a braun 3 series wet electric shaver, and added the Remington King of Shaves alphagel to the purchase more as an after thought, but what a difference.  At first I tried the new shaver dry shaving over the sink and it was marginal at best with my beard.  Then the next day I got in the shower and used the shaver with the&lt;br /&gt;Rem,ington Alphagel, and man oh man what a difference.  The shaver was now getting really close and way more comfortable. I have the quality of at least as good as a blade shave and way more comfort.  No bleeding.  No razor rashes.  Try this product.</li>
            <li> I had used Alpha Gel for several years.  Remington took over marketing of it in the US for King of Shaves but that agreement soon collapsed making the product unavailable in retail stores.  I am thrilled to find it through the Amazon vendor.  Best shave product I have ever used- better than aerosol gels, foam, or any creams.</li>
            <li> I use shave gels.  I currently use the Schick Hydro Shave Gel and Schick Hydro 5 razor.  The one thing I&#x27;ve never liked about shaving cream or even current gels, is after you put them on and they foam up, if you wait a minute and then gently touch the foam, all the bubbles dissapate and there&#x27;s nothing left on your skin!  So, I figured this stuff- this non-foaming gel, would be what I&#x27;ve always wanted: A GEL. I was hesitant to try this, because I am picky about my shaving stuff: I get terrible razor burn and ingrown hairs.  But, this stuff worked pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;First off, you notice it has a VERY STRONG SMELL.  It smells like Vicks Vaporub or something.  It actually cleared up my nose while shaving.  A side benefit, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;It does FEEL good on the skin - it tingles - sort of wakes you up / makes you think it&#x27;s doing something.  It was nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird to use, because after you put it on, you can&#x27;t tell or see where you put it.  That was a little odd and I had to make sure that I put it on everywhere, as well as double check places I&#x27;d shaved.  You can&#x27;t see it once it&#x27;s on your skin, so it makes shaving really weird.  I shave every spot a bunch anyways, and didn&#x27;t notice any irritation doing so with this product.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself using it, if that says anything.  I got a real nice shave - I&#x27;m happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;So, aside from getting used to that very powerful odor, and not being able to see where it is on your face, I will be buying this again.  It&#x27;s a GEL that stays a GEL on your face.  You don&#x27;t need all that white foam clogging up your blade when all you need is a simple gel to cushion your face.  I&#x27;m impressed by this product and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE **&lt;br /&gt;It has been quite some time since I received this and I&#x27;m still using it - and liking it a lot.  I&#x27;ve really become accustomed to shaving with a pure \\&quot;gel\\&quot; instead of those canister gel-things that just turn into foam when you use them on your face.  I do find that this stuff is a bit tougher to rinse off my blade, but overall I like it quite a lot and will be buying this stuff going forward.  The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!) time, you just splash a little water on your face and you can still feel the gel there.bit tougher to rinse off my blade, but overall I like it quite a lot and will be buying this stuff going forward.  The medicated feel it has on your skin is refreshing and nice, and when I want to hit an area again for a second or third (or tenth!) time, you just splash a little water on your face and you can still feel the gel there.</li>
            <li> Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Cooling Menthol Shave Gel works as advertised. It lubricates my skin and makes shaving pretty effortless. I&#x27;d almost compare it favorably to my standard shaving gel [[ASIN:B000052YIE Edge Sensitive Skin Shave Gel for Men]]. I was a bit surprised when I first used the Remington Gel it as it doesn&#x27;t foam up as Edge Gel does, but it works just as well and perhaps makes shaving a bit easier since you not having to deal with foam getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I said \\&quot;almost compare it favorably\\&quot; above because the scent of the Remington Menthol Gel is a bit off-putting. The smell is rather medicinal, and I&#x27;d have to make sure to wash this off my face completely after use as I have no interest in smelling like this product when I&#x27;m done.  The addition of menthol masks the medicinal scent somewhat (it does smell better than the [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel]]), but the scent of this product is still is a negative.  In addition, with current pricing this product is about twice as expensive as Edge Gel, and I&#x27;m not sure this product is worth the cost premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if Remington could work on this product a bit more and tone down the unpleasant scent (and I found a good deal on it) I might consider making this my go-to shave gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with a Schick Quattro, Gilette Fusion, and Gilette GoodNews. The Quattro and Fusion gums up pretty bad. I think its because the spacing between the blades is narrow. Once it gunks up, the blade doesn&#x27;t shave reliably. It&#x27;s stickier than shaving cream, and not as water-soluble, so you cannot just run it under hot water. You have to tap it on sing repeatedly to get it clean. I once tapped the Fusion so hard, the moisturizing strip fell off. This product is hard on the reusable blades, so expect less life out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shaves are great! Smooth clean passes with almost no razor burn. Skin isn&#x27;t dry. In fact, the shave gel works so well, I don&#x27;t even need aftershave. The disposable GoodNews was interesting. I hate these. They always leave my skin ashy and burns for hours. But I had a bunch of them lying around and I wanted to test my theory about the blade spacing. It doesn&#x27;t cake with gel as much and taps out pretty easily. The shave was clean, took fewer passes, and there was considerably less dry skin and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a residual stickiness after the shave, which is a bit uncomfortable. Hot water and a good towel will wash it away. You need to rinse a lot if you&#x27;re using just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on clear and stays clear, unlike other gels that lather on contact.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades glide over skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced razor burn. Almost none with a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin is smooth &amp; hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Gel leaves a sticky feeling and does not rinse away easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;- Gums up between blades and does not rinse away easily. Must tap frequently to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I&#x27;d say this is a pretty fantastic shave gel. But it&#x27;s only marginally better than Lubriderm. Yes, the moisturizing lotion. I apply it thickly. It&#x27;s not as sticky so it doesn&#x27;t clog up the blades. It taps out much easier. The shave is just as close as with Alphagel, but with slightly more razor burn. A little aftershave cools it right down. And of course it moisturizes the skin, its Lubriderm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: This product gives you an excellent close shave with minimal razor burn, but it puts more wear and tear on the razor. And Lubriderm is 99% as good, is cheaper than Alphagel, and is easier on the razor. But Alphagel is very good, so still deserves all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving product I have used in over 30 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> This Remington king of shaves alpha gel produces a really smooth shave quickly.  It&#x27;s refreshing scent is not too strong and it rinses easily, which surprised me because other gels I have used did not. Recommended.</li>
            <li> When the original King of Shaves won the award from the Magazine For Him for best shave gel, I gave it a try. Been hooked ever since &amp; don&#x27;t like using anything else. I have a mole on my chin that I used to nick because I couldn&#x27;t see through the foams I was using. When I switched to this shave gel I loved it, it is smooth as in easy to glide my triple blade razor over,( I shave in the shower) never nick my face when reversing shave directions like I used to, also it has tea tree a natural antiseptic, that I already use in shampoos to control my dandruff. It may not be for everyone, but for me it is the end of my search for a better shave gel. I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better. &amp; believe me I have tried them all. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> i have never used a shave gel before, so it was fun to try this menthol gel; i usually prefer a bay rum or lime-based scent, but the menthol was not objectionable... more interesting is the consistency and slickness of this gel - much slicker than i imagined - and i was able to shave without even wetting my face! this is unusual for me, as i cannot even use regular double- or triple-bladed razors due to the thickness/toughness of my beard (i use a straight razor); one caution: you will need to do a thorough rinse after your shave - this gel provides enough persistent lubrication to take you through at least two passes - a definite advantageous feature!</li>
            <li> The gel probably goes a little heavy on the menthol, but it is probably the best shave gel I&#x27;ve used. The only complaint I have is that the bottle isn&#x27;t really full and you can go through one fairly quickly if you shave every day like I do.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Alphagel, you should! I use the Gillette Fusion Power razor and combined with Alphagel I now experience the most pleasant shaving experience of my life. I am always on the lookout for shaving improvements and Alphagel has been one of the most unexpected, enjoyable shaving surprises I&#x27;ve received in years. Try it, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I got a tube of this stuff because it was on clearance at the grocery store, and I like to try new things. I&#x27;m glad I did because this gel is great! I get a very close shave on my cactus-like beard. My girlfriend noticed how much closer it was as compared to my old Edge gel without me asking. The menthol is pretty strong and makes the shave cool and enjoyable. The near-zero foaming was a little strange at first, but now I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. Once you learn how much to apply, the tube will last a lot longer than you would think by looking at it. I like this gel enough to order it online instead of just picking up a can of whatever at the store, and that says a lot.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Aphagel for a couple of years now, but was using the blue flavor. I saw the green menthol and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best ever. Hey guys, you like a cool, refreshing experience when you shave? This is it. Stop with the foams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this Menthol Alphagel and you will explore shaving other areas....haha.</li>
            <li> This is a good shave gel, but nothing extraordinary.  A little bit goes a long way, and makes for a smooth glide with your razor.  You can get a nice, close shave with it.  I prefer the Sensitive Skin version over this one because I don&#x27;t care for menthol that much.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, though.  I did not find the fragrance overwhelming or even very noticeable as another reviewer mentioned -- I just don&#x27;t care for menthol because it gives a cold, tingly feel.  If you like menthol, this is a good gel to choose; otherwise, try the Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch it up a bit and try some new products. This is one of the ones i thought i would try. I cant say I love it but the smell is very strong menthol. Its kind of nice. as far as the shave.. seems normal. nothing out of the ordinary.. accept that this is a gel and not a foam. it goes on rather clear. I kind of miss being able to see where I have already shaved.. but maybe im doing this wrong?!? I dont know.. but I will use the tubes.. and probably try this stuff again. In the summer the cooling menthol would feel really refreshing. over and out-</li>
            <li> I like gels and this is a good one.  Don&#x27;t expect a lot of foam--you don&#x27;t need it for a good shave--and this product gives you a great, close shave (assuming your shaver is good and sharp).  I especially like it because I like to travel by plane using only carry-on.  I save small containers for refilling with larger products -- saving lots of money.  So I filled a small, plastic 1-oz bottle with this product and it worked like a champ!  I think I now get better shaves on trips than at home!  Also the menthol gives a nice feel to the face and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great shave gel. It shaves really well and I you cant beat the value of getting 2 x 5oz tubes for that price. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel took a little getting used to, as it doesn&#x27;t foam up to look like regular shaving cream, and I like regular white-colored shaving cream because it allows you to see- as you scrape it off with your blade- where on your face you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t.  However, I quickly got past that, as this pleasant cooling gel felt good on my face and nicely added welcome levels of moisturizing and lubrication to the whole shaving process.  There&#x27;s a nice scent, too.  Yes, I do have to pay a little more attention to where on my face I&#x27;ve already shaved and where I still need to, but I&#x27;m up to the challenge.  Oh, and this shave gel rinses away cleanly with a few splashes of water after you&#x27;re done shaving.  Anyway, good product, I&#x27;d use it again.</li>
            <li> I put this on my shelf and left it for quite some time. I&#x27;m not sure why, but the concept of using something that looked so much like a gel and not cream to shave with seemed weird to me. Once you get it going, it lathers pretty well, but it still seemed strange to me. It works well, and I think a lot of people would really like it, I just seem to have a mental block about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet on this shave gel. I see shave cream/gel as having two main purposes in order of importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;1) lubricant, I use a basic Gillette Custom Plus Pivot (a grandiose name for a two bladed, pivoting head disposable razor) and I want my shave cream/gel to provide an adequate level of lubricant so that I do not get razor burn, most basic creams do this well for me, the Alphagel works very well in this respect&lt;br /&gt;2) visual marker, I want to know what parts of my face still require shaving, I often shave in less than bright light and use the cream still on my face as a place holder for what has and has not been shaved, the Alphagel fails this purpose miserably (note: they bill the low foaming as a feature when shaving around goatees and sideburns, most of my friends that have this sort of concern use an electric razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, I won&#x27;t argue if the cream has a pleasant smell and added skin benefits like aloe. The Alphagel offers a &#x27;cooling&#x27; menthol additive, some users may find it refreshing, I find it just shy of uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is that I find the gel to be usable, though it fails on one of my requirements and is on the border of discomfort; I will not be getting more of this when it is used up. I&#x27;ll be returning to my usual shave cream. P-)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried - But it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li> I found this product at Marshall&#x27;s one day and decided to buy for my husband.  He is absolutely crazy about it now.  It used to be available at Bed Bath and Beyond but now they don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.  Very easy to find on Amazon and considering how wonderful it is, it&#x27;s a very fairly priced indulgence.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I have gone from a blade razor over to an electric.  Mind you, I am using one of the most expensive electric razors on the market, the Panasonic ES-LV61.  If you truly want an electric razor that gets about as close as a blade, this is the one.  The Braun 7 series may be another worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my normal routine for the past two years has been essentially using the electric razor dry.  To do this, I would have to apply a coating of Lectric Shave and then after shaving, a skin conditioner such as Afta (or any similar after shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most, I have enjoyed my dry shaves with the electric razor, though once in a while I can get a little bit of razor burn which can be common with these types of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the heck of it, one day I decided to try a wet shave with my Panasonic electric razor (yes, you can use it wet).  Reading many reviews across Amazon, it seemed that people were swearing by KING OF SHAVES brand shaving gel.  Bought a tube and put it immediately to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Gosh.  Shaving will never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much of this stuff, so a tube goes a loooong way.  You simply put a small dab on your fingers, rub them together and then across your face and neck (after washing it with warm/hot water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage of using this gel with an electric razor is like night and day over dry.  With the gel acting as a lubricant, the electric razor just glides over the surface.  You can go over and over the same areas without fear of razor burn.  The gel doesn&#x27;t gunk up the blades.  My wet shave is even CLOSER than it was when I used it dry if something like that is possible.  All I can tell you is that the skin is so perfectly smooth, that I find myself rubbing my hand across my face several times a day just to marvel at the softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KING OF SHAVES has saved me money.  I no longer need a pre-electric lotion such as Lectric Shave.  Thanks to the cooling Menthol, I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, either.  I was able to get rid of two products I would normally use and get equal or better results with just one tube of KING OF SHAVES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am somewhat concerned over the fact that Remington has bought this product.  When I bought my tube, it did not have the Remington label across the top.  Now it appears that the original manufacturer has sold out to this company.  If Remington hasn&#x27;t altered the ingredients, there is nothing to worry about.  My guess is that they are not out to ruin a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who enjoy your electric razors are going to be amazed at the results you receive with KING OF SHAVES.  You&#x27;ll never want to shave dry again.ks to the cooling Menthol, I don&#x27;t need an aftershave, either.

            <li> Before trying the Alphagel Shave Gel Cooling Menthol, I had previous tried the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; version (the blue gel) which I called the best shaving experience I have ever had with a gel or foam.  The green Cooling Menthol is actually better.  It gives the same smooth shave as the blue kind but there is even less irritation when you use the green kind.  Now using this product is the best shave I ever had.  The cooling menthol really works.  There is a weird mint smell (despite claiming to be fragrance free) but it is worth it for a shave this good.</li>
            <li> As good as anything on the market - easy to use no fuss -  it works and the price is OK</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to shaving rashes, and I&#x27;m always trying new shaving gels, creams, and foams. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and like it very much so far. No rash and smooth legs.</li>
            <li> There is no question this product has a lot of menthol and the first time you use it, your skin will be bedamned cold.  But for DE shaving, it just doesn&#x27;t match the many Proraso, Omega, or Taylor of Old Bond products offered by Amazon.  And the menthol effect progressively deteriorates if you use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one advantage of a gel with DE shaving (that I can see): rubbing a gel in shows you where you&#x27;ve missed, but lathering (briefly with this product).  But its so slick my Derby sharpness is partially nullified, so I&#x27;m glad I got this two pack for $6.  I&#x27;ll give it to my brother who is a cartridge hold out and likes this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comments that it doesn&#x27;t foam a lot, but I like this product. I used to use Gillete Foam with Menthol, but I can only find that product in Mexico. And even that one, feels like they reduced the amount of Menthol. Remington Alphagel cooling menthol is my new favorite. You can feel the menthol, feels cool against the skin. I actually rub the excess on my chest and privates, ha... The sensation is like rubbing an ice cube on your skin. My brother told me that was a good tip by the way: shave with warm water and then use an ice cube against your skin. It is supposed to close the skin&#x27;s pores or something. Anyhow, cooling menthol kind of feels like that - like rubbing an ice cube on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Nivea for Men, Sensitive, Shaving Foam. It smells nice. I recommend that one if you want a good smelling foam. But I personally shelved it in favor of the Remington cooling menthol. Only down side is it is more expensive than the other products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Will never use anything else. My one beef, and the reason for the 1-star deduction, is the plastic the cap is made out of is too brittle. If the tube is dropped it will shatter and usually break the hinge. For people like me that shave in the shower that&#x27;s a real pain. Please reformulate the plastic in the top to give it a little more durability on impact and you&#x27;ll have a PERFECT product!</li>
            <li> For a long time now, the &amp;#34;King-of-Shaves&amp;#34; gel has been the best product on the market for using with standard multi-blade razors.  Close shave, far fewer nicks, and seems like improved blade life as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using King of shaves for a few years now and I am very impressed with this product.  it has done away with any razor burn that I used to get with other foams and gels, it only takes a small amount when shaving.  I ordered it from Amazon because it is becoming harder to find in our local stores here in Nebraska.  The cooling menthol is a little too much for my skin, but if you like that sensation, it certinely lives up to its name.  This manufacturer has several other types of gels available that are not menthol.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaves/gel out there.  Feels like you are coming back from a barber shop shave.  King of Shaves was bought over by Remington (or there was some sort of distribution deal), but that has been terminated.  So I hope King of Shaves comes back as an independent vendor.</li>
