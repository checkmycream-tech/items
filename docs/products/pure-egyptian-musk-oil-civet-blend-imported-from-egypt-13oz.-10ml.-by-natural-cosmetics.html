            <li>My boyfriend loved the smell</li>

            <li>This is a beautiful and rich egyptian musk.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and lasts ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>Really smells wonderful...</li>
            <li>It smells so nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The smell of the perfume grows on you and the sense increases making you feel warm.</li>
            <li>NICE SMELL,</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>Not as good as &amp;#34;Kuumba made&amp;#34;, but OK.</li>
            <li>Product itself is nice-</li>
            <li>This stuff smells kind of \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; to me, but I suppose that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like?</li>
            <li>This lasts much longer and the price is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>This is not the best EM I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I can kiss my own self.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s your very own unique blend.</li>
            <li>Very sexy scent:).</li>
            <li>But the applicator makes putting it on very easy.</li>
            <li>It mixes with your body&#x27;s own chemistry and BANG like magic</li>
            <li>I will be getting more for the family</li>
            <li>I love this musk oil.</li>
            <li>Im going to try more sents...</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the must.</li>
            <li>I can buy a bottle at this smoke shop for 4 bucks and it smells WAY better.</li>
            <li>I gave it away:)</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my body and then spray one of my favorite colognes over it to accentuate the aroma.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get more complements on this fragrance than some I&#x27;ve paid $100 for..</li>
            <li>I JUST PURCHASED THIS OIL AND LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the smell....</li>
            <li>many compliments</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I had way better than what has been a not to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite...</li>
            <li>Many were watery and smelled more alcohol-like than anything.</li>
            <li>Prefect if they would add more of what would make the scent linger .</li>
            <li>I guess the way to prevent that would be for the seller to pay attention to the comments and make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li>Is this synthetic civet? or authentic civet?</li>
            <li>I love the smell it is just like the oil</li>
            <li>love it i will buy again</li>
            <li>flowery for my tastes, maybe it would be better on a woman.</li>
            <li>I like exotic things and this perfume</li>
            <li>sure is.  </li>
            <li>but it is okay...</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for authentic Egyptian Musk, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve added to my favorite E Musks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will be transferring it to an more appropriate container.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more one for each of my neighbors to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I have purchased better smelling musk oils.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Respectfully Mrs. M.T.S</li>
            <li>Okay fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;supposed to enhance what one is already wearing, and get better as time goes by.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is ok,  I must like it better in the summer than in the winter, but I love egyptian musk.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She said that she love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They need to get a better application process.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found my fav....</li>
            <li>It smells better as it warms on your skin.</li>
            <li>I would not get this again, but it was not a terrible experience or anything.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Very nice , sweet , soft , sexy , elegant parfume !</li>
            <li>It is never over powering, but gives you that fresh exotic fragrance that seems to be enhanced by your own body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean, light fragrance that lasts.</li>
            <li>The oil is fantastic just the smell I love to wear.</li>
            <li>My neighbors loved the way i smelled so much they asked me to let them in on where i got my fragrance.</li>
            <li>company n name can b shared easily with people that notice the scent.</li>
            <li>ordered this E Musk (Civet Blend) several and just ordered 2 more roll ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price or great customer service from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice but not as good as te last one I had purchased.</li>
            <li>so strong fragrance is prohibited.</li>
            <li>so it is too strong for me</li>
            <li>Too strong.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last .  </li>
            <li>Light scent that dissipates very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just received oil today (which was a quick delivery-thanks for that!)</li>
            <li>but overall happy with the product based on the price.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and floral.</li>
            <li>Love the sexy smell of this oil, it&#x27;s sexy yet innocent and mysterious all at once...</li>
            <li>This does appear to be the genuine Egyptian Musk...</li>
            <li>It was nice to have because I love musk, but I wish that the perfume would have been more lasting</li>
            <li>I dont know if its genuine or not..</li>
            <li>but the sent was really light</li>
            <li>The color of the oil was a light color</li>
            <li>This IS exactly the sweet and warm Egyptian Musk scent I was searching for.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt this is pure and authentic Egyptian musk oil, BUT it smells so good.</li>
            <li>great scent that will last all day....not too strong and far from weak...will be sure to order some more of this product.</li>
            <li>Other wise no stars!</li>
            <li>I have been trying online to find the original scent.  </li>
            <li>B0067MHJAE Kiehl&#x27;s Original Musk Oil - 14ml/0.5oz]] which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>I love Egyptian Musk, but it is hard to find good quaility oil!</li>
            <li>right about now!  </li>
            <li>This is a true smelling Egyptian Musk, I will purchase again...</li>
            <li>My favorite smell in the whole world.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and girlish, yet animal and provocative.</li>
            <li>this is the true Egyptian musk oil.</li>
            <li>The only way it would be better is if it were free, which is of course, not possible, lol.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the scent is great.</li>
            <li>I personally think it is nice and for people who enjoy a musssky scent.  </li>
            <li>Lot more scent than I expected, kind of \\&quot;flowery?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I excitedly opened the package and applied it; that first and only time, it smelled good.</li>
            <li>I love the different scents of different musks and this one is a great one to wear alone or combined</li>
            <li>It lasted a long time on my skin and it has really good projection.</li>
            <li>When discovering this product, loved the fragrant oil and scent lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>is good but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li>It is a great quality (NOT watered down with alcohol)</li>
            <li>It was a nice light sent and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>okay very very LOUD.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for!</li>
            <li>It smelled great, but did not smell like the Egyptian Oil that I am very familiar with, nor did the scent last very long.</li>
            <li>Egyptian musk is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>One star, because when I opened the bag most of the oil spilled all over the plastic baggy it was enclosed in during delivery, The oil is too thick and sticky, and has a very very light scent, that does not stay or linger on for the whole day, It stays on for about 15 minutes or so, then the very light scent go&#x27;s away...would not recommend for anyone...</li>
            <li>I can hope right?  </li>
            <li>But, it did smell great for the first few days.</li>
            <li>Very floral and clean.</li>
            <li>This oil is very close to the auric blend version except it is not as floral and not as sweet.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is akin to sweet baby powder and may very well have a place on my dresser.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but really hard to get out.</li>
            <li>Really stays on your skin!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I&#x27;ve ordered several for my coworkers</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have better luck next time that I make an online purchase.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly ordered another bottle before the smell disappeared from the first one.  </li>
            <li>I love instant gratification!</li>
            <li>A second reason why I did not write a review is because there is so many oils out there</li>
            <li>Not the same scent that I love.</li>
            <li>I have always gotten it from the same ghetto love shack for $5-$10 per roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li>if only they would add more to the oil they diluted it with??&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would pay 2x the price if you would only add more of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the way it smells directly from the bottle and hours later.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more from this vendor when the one I just bought runs low.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the Civet Oil I remembered and loved, not even a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li>Clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and a little sweet for my taste but the service was very fast arrived in 2 days and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I always get positive comments from both men and women.</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice but does not last for more than a few moments</li>
            <li>I constantly have to reapply thus it finishes very quickly .</li>
            <li>fact that it says &#x27;pure&#x27; or &#x27;civet&#x27; is relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to run under warm water to get the little ball rolling.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li>But, what came was a lot more (volume-wise) than I had expected and is certainly what I&#x27;d ordered.</li>
            <li>Also, oil seemed thick and hard to apply, did not roll on all that great, even after placing in warm water as suggested</li>
            <li>Please how much for a 1 oz bottle or 2 oz?</li>
            <li>I really like this oil......</li>
            <li>very week</li>
            <li>This product used to be readily available in my hometown through several vendors.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I am still looking for 100 percent real Egyptian musk.  </li>
            <li>oil is much lighter in appearance and it&#x27;s smell differs from Hairsoftly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, if there WERE civet in it..you&#x27;d know it..as real civet smells like cat</li>
            <li>The seller shipped out really, REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>The Egyptian Musk Oil might have been imported from Egypt but once they got it,  it was cut with way too much oil.....</li>
            <li>really enjoys the smell of egyptian musk</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>and you really can&#x27;t smell it .</li>
            <li>I get compliments EVERY time I wear it, not too strong, scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Too strong and not soft as musk</li>
            <li>prefer the more flowery scent of this over other musks like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Oils are triggered by the heat of your body, so people who say they don&#x27;t smell it might need to be more active, or they may have received a week version of the product.</li>
            <li>This product was far superior to the product I used in the past, Jovan Civet Oil.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good the longer it sits and last even after a good shower you can still smell it, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like another One you have laying around smell different at first, then they smell similar after sitting, weird right</li>
            <li>The only true description is that is oil...sticky gewy oil...with no scent.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s this high pungent note in the fragrance that you smell when you rub it on.</li>
            <li>I have not tried Egyptian Musk oil since high school (26 yrs ago :0)</li>
            <li>Smells nice mixed with other fragrances</li>
            <li>Good smell but very thick and the rollerball didn&#x27;t work (I couldn&#x27;t apply it).</li>
            <li>Just the right degree of fragrance, long lasting and rich aroma.</li>
            <li>If loving you is wrong I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick oil.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works and smells fine..</li>
            <li>SMELL LIKE YEARS AGO, BUT THE SMELL IS VERY OLD FASHION, I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was the roller stopped functioning after my first application.</li>
            <li>Was not the same oil I received the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li>Rich, bold but subtle, smells just like</li>
            <li>great, a little sweeter than the Egyptian musk that I am used to in the past.</li>
            <li>Great smell but a little diluted than what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Item is in glass bottle which is good, however it is a roll on, which IMO is not good for any essential oils.</li>
            <li>Smells just as good as more expensive perfume oils if not better.</li>
            <li>Larger bottle than expected, and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love Egyptian Musk hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this as a first time Egyptian Musk Oil user to see if they like the scent, HOWEVER I personally recommend any repeating users to purchase my 2nd oil to refill this bottle (DONT THROW THIS BOTTLE AWAY REFILL RE-USE)</li>
            <li>Smells like Old Lady.</li>
            <li>One word LOUD</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get at least one more until a write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a repeat customer with Natural Cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will stick with Natural Cosmetic along with the Claudia&#x27;s Incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I used to frequent lounges, cultural events and gatherings of light-minded folks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>Now this is more my style very soft and subtle aroma not heavy or overbearing</li>
            <li>Then a couple of days later, the smell is COMPLETELY GONE!!!</li>
            <li>Ok, just not strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time in African Import stores and neo-jazzy spots with incense diffused throughout and ambient lighting to set the mood for intimate performances of spoken word, real hip hop and song.</li>
            <li>Will update this in a week, depending on what others think of the smell on me, but like most of these things, it smells different on each person so it&#x27;s hard to judge the product for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This item shipped quickly and received in a few days.</li>
            <li>On the outside, the bottle smells like a soft musk.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic  is really thick</li>
            <li>I usually forget that I&#x27;m even wearing it until a random person stops me and asks me what I am wearing or that I smell good!</li>
            <li>and the price is really forgiving for such a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>only other E Musk Body OIL I recommend is from Claudia&#x27;s Incense who bought out Smoking Joes...which is still being sold as Smoking Joes but really is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia&#x27;s</li>
            <li>But when I sniffed, there wasn&#x27;t any odor, and when I tipped it with my fingertip over the top, it felt extremely sticky, and was very thick; it reminded me of old cooking oil.</li>
            <li>was not sure it was the right product I ordered.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My boyfriend loved the smell</li>
            <li> The roller doesnt work well on the product but the oil is good.</li>
            <li> and I have been wanting to try it again for a while but have not had a chance to get my hand on a good bottle of it.  </li>
            <li> Product fragrance was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; nothing exceptional.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out and was very pleased with this decision</li>

            <li> This is a beautiful and rich egyptian musk.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and lasts ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> Really smells wonderful...</li>
            <li> It smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume grows on you and the sense increases making you feel warm.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL,</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> Not as good as &amp;#34;Kuumba made&amp;#34;, but OK.</li>
            <li> Product itself is nice-</li>
            <li> This stuff smells kind of \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; to me, but I suppose that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like?</li>
            <li> This lasts much longer and the price is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the best EM I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I can kiss my own self.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s your very own unique blend.</li>
            <li> Very sexy scent:).</li>
            <li> But the applicator makes putting it on very easy.</li>
            <li> It mixes with your body&#x27;s own chemistry and BANG like magic</li>
            <li> I will be getting more for the family</li>
            <li> I love this musk oil.</li>
            <li> Im going to try more sents...</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the must.</li>
            <li> I can buy a bottle at this smoke shop for 4 bucks and it smells WAY better.</li>
            <li> I gave it away:)</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my body and then spray one of my favorite colognes over it to accentuate the aroma.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get more complements on this fragrance than some I&#x27;ve paid $100 for..</li>
            <li> I JUST PURCHASED THIS OIL AND LOVE</li>
            <li> Love the smell....</li>
            <li> many compliments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I had way better than what has been a not to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite...</li>
            <li> Many were watery and smelled more alcohol-like than anything.</li>
            <li> Prefect if they would add more of what would make the scent linger .</li>
            <li> I guess the way to prevent that would be for the seller to pay attention to the comments and make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li> Is this synthetic civet? or authentic civet?</li>
            <li> I love the smell it is just like the oil</li>
            <li> love it i will buy again</li>
            <li> flowery for my tastes, maybe it would be better on a woman.</li>
            <li> I like exotic things and this perfume</li>
            <li> sure is.  </li>
            <li> but it is okay...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for authentic Egyptian Musk, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve added to my favorite E Musks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will be transferring it to an more appropriate container.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more one for each of my neighbors to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have purchased better smelling musk oils.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Respectfully Mrs. M.T.S</li>
            <li> Okay fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;supposed to enhance what one is already wearing, and get better as time goes by.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is ok,  I must like it better in the summer than in the winter, but I love egyptian musk.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She said that she love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They need to get a better application process.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found my fav....</li>
            <li> It smells better as it warms on your skin.</li>
            <li> I would not get this again, but it was not a terrible experience or anything.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Very nice , sweet , soft , sexy , elegant parfume !</li>
            <li> It is never over powering, but gives you that fresh exotic fragrance that seems to be enhanced by your own body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean, light fragrance that lasts.</li>
            <li> The oil is fantastic just the smell I love to wear.</li>
            <li> My neighbors loved the way i smelled so much they asked me to let them in on where i got my fragrance.</li>
            <li> company n name can b shared easily with people that notice the scent.</li>
            <li> ordered this E Musk (Civet Blend) several and just ordered 2 more roll ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price or great customer service from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice but not as good as te last one I had purchased.</li>
            <li> so strong fragrance is prohibited.</li>
            <li> so it is too strong for me</li>
            <li> Too strong.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last .  </li>
            <li> Light scent that dissipates very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Just received oil today (which was a quick delivery-thanks for that!)</li>
            <li> but overall happy with the product based on the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and floral.</li>
            <li> Love the sexy smell of this oil, it&#x27;s sexy yet innocent and mysterious all at once...</li>
            <li> This does appear to be the genuine Egyptian Musk...</li>
            <li> It was nice to have because I love musk, but I wish that the perfume would have been more lasting</li>
            <li> I dont know if its genuine or not..</li>
            <li> but the sent was really light</li>
            <li> The color of the oil was a light color</li>
            <li> This IS exactly the sweet and warm Egyptian Musk scent I was searching for.  </li>
            <li> I highly doubt this is pure and authentic Egyptian musk oil, BUT it smells so good.</li>
            <li> great scent that will last all day....not too strong and far from weak...will be sure to order some more of this product.</li>
            <li> Other wise no stars!</li>
            <li> I have been trying online to find the original scent.  </li>
            <li> B0067MHJAE Kiehl&#x27;s Original Musk Oil - 14ml/0.5oz]] which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I love Egyptian Musk, but it is hard to find good quaility oil!</li>
            <li> right about now!  </li>
            <li> This is a true smelling Egyptian Musk, I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> My favorite smell in the whole world.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet and girlish, yet animal and provocative.</li>
            <li> this is the true Egyptian musk oil.</li>
            <li> The only way it would be better is if it were free, which is of course, not possible, lol.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the scent is great.</li>
            <li> I personally think it is nice and for people who enjoy a musssky scent.  </li>
            <li> Lot more scent than I expected, kind of \\&quot;flowery?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I excitedly opened the package and applied it; that first and only time, it smelled good.</li>
            <li> I love the different scents of different musks and this one is a great one to wear alone or combined</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time on my skin and it has really good projection.</li>
            <li> When discovering this product, loved the fragrant oil and scent lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> is good but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> It is a great quality (NOT watered down with alcohol)</li>
            <li> It was a nice light sent and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> okay very very LOUD.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for!</li>
            <li> It smelled great, but did not smell like the Egyptian Oil that I am very familiar with, nor did the scent last very long.</li>
            <li> Egyptian musk is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> One star, because when I opened the bag most of the oil spilled all over the plastic baggy it was enclosed in during delivery, The oil is too thick and sticky, and has a very very light scent, that does not stay or linger on for the whole day, It stays on for about 15 minutes or so, then the very light scent go&#x27;s away...would not recommend for anyone...</li>
            <li> I can hope right?  </li>
            <li> But, it did smell great for the first few days.</li>
            <li> Very floral and clean.</li>
            <li> This oil is very close to the auric blend version except it is not as floral and not as sweet.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is akin to sweet baby powder and may very well have a place on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but really hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Really stays on your skin!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I&#x27;ve ordered several for my coworkers</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have better luck next time that I make an online purchase.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered another bottle before the smell disappeared from the first one.  </li>
            <li> I love instant gratification!</li>
            <li> A second reason why I did not write a review is because there is so many oils out there</li>
            <li> Not the same scent that I love.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten it from the same ghetto love shack for $5-$10 per roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li> if only they would add more to the oil they diluted it with??&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would pay 2x the price if you would only add more of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the way it smells directly from the bottle and hours later.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase more from this vendor when the one I just bought runs low.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the Civet Oil I remembered and loved, not even a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li> Clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and a little sweet for my taste but the service was very fast arrived in 2 days and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I always get positive comments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> fragrance is nice but does not last for more than a few moments</li>
            <li> I constantly have to reapply thus it finishes very quickly .</li>
            <li> fact that it says &#x27;pure&#x27; or &#x27;civet&#x27; is relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to run under warm water to get the little ball rolling.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li> But, what came was a lot more (volume-wise) than I had expected and is certainly what I&#x27;d ordered.</li>
            <li> Also, oil seemed thick and hard to apply, did not roll on all that great, even after placing in warm water as suggested</li>
            <li> Please how much for a 1 oz bottle or 2 oz?</li>
            <li> I really like this oil......</li>
            <li> very week</li>
            <li> This product used to be readily available in my hometown through several vendors.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I am still looking for 100 percent real Egyptian musk.  </li>
            <li> oil is much lighter in appearance and it&#x27;s smell differs from Hairsoftly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, if there WERE civet in it..you&#x27;d know it..as real civet smells like cat</li>
            <li> The seller shipped out really, REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian Musk Oil might have been imported from Egypt but once they got it,  it was cut with way too much oil.....</li>
            <li> really enjoys the smell of egyptian musk</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> and you really can&#x27;t smell it .</li>
            <li> I get compliments EVERY time I wear it, not too strong, scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Too strong and not soft as musk</li>
            <li> prefer the more flowery scent of this over other musks like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Oils are triggered by the heat of your body, so people who say they don&#x27;t smell it might need to be more active, or they may have received a week version of the product.</li>
            <li> This product was far superior to the product I used in the past, Jovan Civet Oil.  </li>
            <li> Smells really good the longer it sits and last even after a good shower you can still smell it, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like another One you have laying around smell different at first, then they smell similar after sitting, weird right</li>
            <li> The only true description is that is oil...sticky gewy oil...with no scent.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s this high pungent note in the fragrance that you smell when you rub it on.</li>
            <li> I have not tried Egyptian Musk oil since high school (26 yrs ago :0)</li>
            <li> Smells nice mixed with other fragrances</li>
            <li> Good smell but very thick and the rollerball didn&#x27;t work (I couldn&#x27;t apply it).</li>
            <li> Just the right degree of fragrance, long lasting and rich aroma.</li>
            <li> If loving you is wrong I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick oil.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it works and smells fine..</li>
            <li> SMELL LIKE YEARS AGO, BUT THE SMELL IS VERY OLD FASHION, I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the roller stopped functioning after my first application.</li>
            <li> Was not the same oil I received the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li> Rich, bold but subtle, smells just like</li>
            <li> great, a little sweeter than the Egyptian musk that I am used to in the past.</li>
            <li> Great smell but a little diluted than what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Item is in glass bottle which is good, however it is a roll on, which IMO is not good for any essential oils.</li>
            <li> Smells just as good as more expensive perfume oils if not better.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than expected, and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love Egyptian Musk hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this as a first time Egyptian Musk Oil user to see if they like the scent, HOWEVER I personally recommend any repeating users to purchase my 2nd oil to refill this bottle (DONT THROW THIS BOTTLE AWAY REFILL RE-USE)</li>
            <li> Smells like Old Lady.</li>
            <li> One word LOUD</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get at least one more until a write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer with Natural Cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will stick with Natural Cosmetic along with the Claudia&#x27;s Incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I used to frequent lounges, cultural events and gatherings of light-minded folks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> Now this is more my style very soft and subtle aroma not heavy or overbearing</li>
            <li> Then a couple of days later, the smell is COMPLETELY GONE!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, just not strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in African Import stores and neo-jazzy spots with incense diffused throughout and ambient lighting to set the mood for intimate performances of spoken word, real hip hop and song.</li>
            <li> Will update this in a week, depending on what others think of the smell on me, but like most of these things, it smells different on each person so it&#x27;s hard to judge the product for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This item shipped quickly and received in a few days.</li>
            <li> On the outside, the bottle smells like a soft musk.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic  is really thick</li>
            <li> I usually forget that I&#x27;m even wearing it until a random person stops me and asks me what I am wearing or that I smell good!</li>
            <li> and the price is really forgiving for such a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> only other E Musk Body OIL I recommend is from Claudia&#x27;s Incense who bought out Smoking Joes...which is still being sold as Smoking Joes but really is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia&#x27;s</li>
            <li> But when I sniffed, there wasn&#x27;t any odor, and when I tipped it with my fingertip over the top, it felt extremely sticky, and was very thick; it reminded me of old cooking oil.</li>
            <li> was not sure it was the right product I ordered.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t quite last as long as the Egyptian musk that I got from a vendor at the flea market strangely enough years ago.</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> not as long lasting  as I am used to.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t roll on well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The roller doesn&#x27;t work too well and the scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of dollar store patchouli and toilet deodorizer!</li>
            <li> Your girlfriend will be smelling you all night long.</li>
            <li> I only spent $5 dollars...</li>
            <li> Cant find the egptian musk that I long for any where.</li>
            <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t stay for long, but as long as it stays its pleasure to smell it..</li>
            <li> Maybe because the PO was in a slow season, but still, they shipped fast and this is just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the oil is so thick that I had to remove the roller, and unbeknownst to me a bunch of it spilled in my cosmetic bag, so I only have like a fourth of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> At some of the corner stores I tried other brands of this product and they were just not the same, although they claimed it was.</li>
            <li> AND DO YOU CARRY BLACK WOMAN OR BLACK WOMAN NEW YORK</li>
            <li> Noticed the roll-ball was dry; thinking it was defective, I removed it so I could use my finger to dab it on.</li>
            <li> The roller is really dry.</li>
            <li> This was not the same musk i purchase a few months back</li>
            <li> fragrance is a bit watered down, last about half as long as the initial plant guru sellers version.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Also it arrived way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this fragrance  -subtle natural and fragrant and very very thick  I only wish it came in larger size--and that Natural Cosmetics could offer a body lotion and soap as well as I would be ordering it on a regular basis</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It did not smell strongly enough like the other oil I&#x27;d purchased in the past from a place that I cannott remember where I&#x27;d gone.  </li>
            <li> I wish that this product came in a larger size instead of the small roll on bottles.  </li>
            <li> WHAT OTHER FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> I had read all the other reviews, and thought I would give it a try anyway....</li>
            <li> A little difficult to apply at first.</li>
            <li> Will not order again because not worth the price.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I even shook them by tipping upside down and downside up for mixing but still no smell.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to get the same blend but disappointed to find that it&#x27;s nowhere near the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and the flavors lasts allllll day long!</li>
            <li> This oil has a little bit of a perfume or alcohol in it whereas the Auric Blend does not.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Well, bummer, I wasted my money again.</li>
            <li> again tried to purchase Egyptian Musk Oil and found this one to be a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> but I could at least smell it if I were to compare it to the other distributors that I tried.</li>
            <li> The oil is so thick that try as I might, I can&#x27;t get the roller ball to transfer hardly anything from the bottle to my skin and the little that I did get out was so sticky that it felt like thick motor oil and left my skin sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> Not very strong and the oil is really thick.</li>
            <li> Has very little scent-</li>
            <li> Or very little aroma.  </li>
            <li> Please DONT waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Not sure why the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I recommend mixing 3/4 of the bottle to a small vaseline jar that is already 1/4 used (so that mixing is easier).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I even received the correct fragrance.</li>
            <li> total fail.  </li>
            <li> It thick and very little fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this oil which is less fragrant than Mumba.  </li>
            <li> This hardly have ANY smell and IF you do smell something....</li>
            <li> because, there is hardly any smell.</li>
            <li> hardly can smell any musk</li>
            <li> hardly any smell</li>
            <li> Hard to roll on...</li>
            <li> I can hardly smell it in the bottle</li>
            <li> the roll ball sucks the smell</li>
            <li> The oil was too thick and the smell did not linger.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a subtle musk oil</li>
            <li> Too floral and not a good musk scent.</li>
            <li> Hardly any fragrance at all!  </li>
            <li> I had to rate at least one star to post this !</li>
            <li> There is this very subtle so subtle that it is almost unnoticeable unless someone hugs you.</li>
            <li> the bottle leaked during delivery but the roller does not work when i try to roll it on, i have to use it with out the roller.. not very impressed with this product</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this oil</li>
            <li> not watery, very thick oil....</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick, but the roller thing works as it should.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and rather sticky, so the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; seems to have some staying power, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> i am not happy</li>
            <li> not happy with the smell not e.musk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to take :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird.</li>
            <li> I was not happy and I won&#x27;t be buying from them again, and neither will my friends!</li>
            <li> I was sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be wearing this fragrance, as it does not smell like the Egyptian Musk that I am used to.</li>
            <li> the stale oil smell is almost stronger than the scent..  </li>
            <li> I was too afraid of getting a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed to thick no smell at all won&#x27;t roll out !</li>
            <li> Maybe they were from a bad batch (??).</li>
            <li> Too bad it is so diluted.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed by this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Has a nasty chemical smell.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really smells wonderful...great product!</li>
            <li> Come 2 days earlier. Smells great. Last all day. Your girlfriend will be smelling you all night long. I will be getting more for the family</li>
            <li> This is a true smelling Egyptian Musk, I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> It did not smell strongly enough like the other oil I&#x27;d purchased in the past from a place that I cannott remember where I&#x27;d gone.  Was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> However, considering the source of musk - I will not be ordering it again.  Just in case you are not in the know...Civet is a cat.</li>
            <li> I love this musk oil. It was a nice light sent and lasted a long time.Im going to try more sents...</li>
            <li> Update 9/19/15. Review ⭐⭐&lt;br /&gt;ordered this scent after initially ordering from a seller named plant guru. Was hoping to get the same blend but disappointed to find that it&#x27;s nowhere near the same. fragrance is a bit watered down, last about half as long as the initial plant guru sellers version. I found that what I have to do is mix it with my existing one to make it last longer...&lt;br /&gt;________&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;__________&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;______&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant guru review. ⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;br /&gt;smells great, a little sweeter than the Egyptian musk that I am used to in the past. doesn&#x27;t quite last as long as the Egyptian musk that I got from a vendor at the flea market strangely enough years ago. but overall happy with the product based on the price. Would definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> I wish that this product came in a larger size instead of the small roll on bottles.  This seller is excellent about getting the product to you and will answer any questions regarding their oil(s).</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the must.</li>
            <li> Ooooooooweeeeeee!! It&#x27;s thick and the flavors lasts allllll day long!</li>
            <li> The oil was too thick and the smell did not linger.</li>
            <li> Roller ball did not roll. Had to jimmy it off. Oil had no scent to it. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Please DONT waste your money on this! This hardly have ANY smell and IF you do smell something....you dont even know what it is..because, there is hardly any smell. I can buy a bottle at this smoke shop for 4 bucks and it smells WAY better. Dont buy!</li>
            <li> I love the scent! I loved the cost! I wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> I get compliments EVERY time I wear it, not too strong, scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Love this!  Have always loved the scent of musk.  Though this is different than say,Jovan Musk or Skin Musk.  This is a nice thick oil.  Really stays on your skin!</li>
            <li> Very good product, Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Horrible scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hated the way this oiled smelled.  I gave it away:)</li>
            <li> Nice but not as good as te last one I had purchased.</li>
            <li> Egyptian musk is by far my favorite scent. It is never over powering, but gives you that fresh exotic fragrance that seems to be enhanced by your own body chemistry. Love it! I like to use it on my body and then spray one of my favorite colognes over it to accentuate the aroma.</li>
            <li> Love it. It smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I&#x27;ve ordered several for my coworkers because working with 148 women they notice everything and I&#x27;m asked almost daily what is that fragrance? It is not overpowering. I work in healthcare so strong fragrance is prohibited. I get more complements on this fragrance than some I&#x27;ve paid $100 for..</li>
            <li> I JUST PURCHASED THIS OIL AND LOVE IT WHAT OTHER FRAGRANCE DO YOU HAVE AND DO YOU CARRY BLACK WOMAN OR BLACK WOMAN NEW YORK</li>
            <li> This is not what Egyptian Musk smells like. Avoid at all cost, thank goodness I only spent $5 dollars...</li>
            <li> Has very little scent-</li>
            <li> My favorite smell in the whole world. Please how much for a 1 oz bottle or 2 oz? I couldn&#x27;t get to the link for the 1oz</li>
            <li> Love the smell....many compliments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. My husband likes it and wears it but I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a matter of taste and what you like. It&#x27;s strong and a little sweet for my taste but the service was very fast arrived in 2 days and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected. It thick and very little fragrance. I had way better than what has been a not to me. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil......</li>
            <li> fragrance is nice but does not last for more than a few moments no one else can detect that I even have it on.</li>
            <li> Very nice , sweet , soft , sexy , elegant parfume ! Love it ! ! !</li>
            <li> On the outside, the bottle smells like a soft musk.  After rolling it on skin, it is simply oil -- no smell at all.  I ordered 2 bottles and both  are simply oil.  I even shook them by tipping upside down and downside up for mixing but still no smell.  Maybe they were from a bad batch (??).</li>
            <li> It was not what I was lookin for.  I guess I&#x27;ll have better luck next time that I make an online purchase.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent and not at all overpowering.  I always get positive comments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> Smells just as good as more expensive perfume oils if not better.</li>
            <li> I love Egyptian Musk hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it smells amazing. Then a couple of days later, the smell is COMPLETELY GONE!!! It smells like nothing. I mistakenly ordered another bottle before the smell disappeared from the first one.  The same thing happened with this one??? It&#x27;s really weird. Not sure why the smell is gone. But, it did smell great for the first few days.</li>
            <li> As soon as oil dries, the scent is gone.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to thick no smell at all won&#x27;t roll out ! I had to rate at least one star to post this ! Other wise no stars!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice but not the one I was looking for...still really great!</li>
            <li> This was not the same musk i purchase a few months back</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent for males or females.  It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite...he wears it daily!</li>
            <li> This oil is very close to the auric blend version except it is not as floral and not as sweet. That might be a good thing because men can use it as well. It lasted a long time on my skin and it has really good projection. A bargain for what I paid.</li>
            <li> very week but I could at least smell it if I were to compare it to the other distributors that I tried. Cant find the egptian musk that I long for any where. HELP! mlangshaw67@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Definitely not the Civet Oil I remembered and loved, not even a cheap imitation. This bares no resemblance the Civet by Houbigant if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This product used to be readily available in my hometown through several vendors. I could go to them and purchase it. When I moved about 50 miles away, this product was nowhere to be found. NOWHERE. Whenever I got back to my hometown, I&#x27;d go buy some. The last time I went home, the vendors I frequented were all gone. At some of the corner stores I tried other brands of this product and they were just not the same, although they claimed it was. Many were watery and smelled more alcohol-like than anything. I decided to see if I could get it through Amazon.com and voila! This is the real deal. I am extremely pleased!!! The only problem I had was the roller stopped functioning after my first application. I ended up taking it off the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.It seems to last a long time.The smell is light and floral.I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume grows on you and the sense increases making you feel warm. I would recommend it to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> very great product wish I would have got more. I tried it out and was very pleased with this decision</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL, SMELL LIKE YEARS AGO, BUT THE SMELL IS VERY OLD FASHION, I LIKE IT. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO YOU,</li>
            <li> Love the sexy smell of this oil, it&#x27;s sexy yet innocent and mysterious all at once... it&#x27;s sweet and girlish, yet animal and provocative.</li>
            <li> I love the different scents of different musks and this one is a great one to wear alone or combined</li>
            <li> Good smell but very thick and the rollerball didn&#x27;t work (I couldn&#x27;t apply it). The company had EXCELLENT customer service, though, and let me return it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the local wig shop for me!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last .  I constantly have to reapply thus it finishes very quickly . Prefect if they would add more of what would make the scent linger .</li>
            <li> Does not smell like musk.  Horrible!!!!! I  Have tried to buy musk over the internet and can&#x27;t find any that has a scent that&lt;br /&gt; smells anything like cavot musk which I use to wear.</li>
            <li> Not even close to what its supposed to smell like. I ordered 2 bottles and threw away both...</li>
            <li> A little difficult to apply at first. Had to run under warm water to get the little ball rolling. Other than that, it works and smells fine..</li>
            <li> I like the smell of egyptian musk, would buy it from Ashby Flea Market in Oakland. This oil is just like it. Oils are triggered by the heat of your body, so people who say they don&#x27;t smell it might need to be more active, or they may have received a week version of the product. I guess the way to prevent that would be for the seller to pay attention to the comments and make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. Also it arrived way sooner than expected. I have a question though. Is this synthetic civet? or authentic civet? Thank you.</li>
            <li> not watery, very thick oil....great scent that will last all day....not too strong and far from weak...will be sure to order some more of this product.</li>
            <li> I had read all the other reviews, and thought I would give it a try anyway....ugh!  The only true description is that is oil...sticky gewy oil...with no scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell it is just like the oil I used 30 years ago. I have already had people say&lt;br /&gt;how nice I smell. Great product.</li>
            <li> love it i will buy again</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  I have been trying online to find the original scent.  From trial and error this is the true Egyptian musk oil.</li>
            <li> Just received and gotta say, this is not a mans scent. Too floral and not a good musk scent. The oil is so thick that try as I might, I can&#x27;t get the roller ball to transfer hardly anything from the bottle to my skin and the little that I did get out was so sticky that it felt like thick motor oil and left my skin sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Too flowery for my tastes, maybe it would be better on a woman. If they can get it out of the bottle and don&#x27;t mind the way it makes their shin feel.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, straight in the waste can.</li>
            <li> I like exotic things and this perfume sure is.  I have been using it for years now and always get compliments..great buy</li>
            <li> UPDATE October 2014&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;The musk is causing contact dermatitis and creating itchy rashes where I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the more flowery scent of this over other musks like [[ASIN:B0067MHJAE Kiehl&#x27;s Original Musk Oil - 14ml/0.5oz]] which I&#x27;ve used for years. Great value, smells like incense.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this fragrance  -subtle natural and fragrant and very very thick  I only wish it came in larger size--and that Natural Cosmetics could offer a body lotion and soap as well as I would be ordering it on a regular basis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely I will order this again  five plus stars!</li>
            <li> It smelled nothing like what it said! Hardly any fragrance at all!  I was not happy and I won&#x27;t be buying from them again, and neither will my friends!</li>
            <li> This oil has a little bit of a perfume or alcohol in it whereas the Auric Blend does not.  but it is okay...the Auric receives 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Could use a label so company n name can b shared easily with people that notice the scent.</li>
            <li> I personally think it is nice and for people who enjoy a musssky scent.  I have asthma so it is too strong for me</li>
            <li> Ok, just not strong enough for me.  Order was just as decribed.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for 100 percent real Egyptian musk.  That scent from the 70&#x27;s.  This is NOT the one.</li>
            <li> smelled like soap? was not sure it was the right product I ordered. I did not like the smell of this I was sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; excellent price;  free shipping.  The only way it would be better is if it were free, which is of course, not possible, lol.</li>
            <li> Not the musk oil smell of my youth.  The search will continue...  I have tried every one offered on Amazon, with the exception of the one that is over $100.  And, if I knew that that one was the one, I&#x27;d happily spend the money.  But I don&#x27;t think you can return it once opened so it&#x27;s a risk I&#x27;m not willing to take :(</li>
            <li> No it did not meet up with my expectations you can&#x27;t even smell anything when u wear it on ur body</li>
            <li> Smells really good the longer it sits and last even after a good shower you can still smell it, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like another One you have laying around smell different at first, then they smell similar after sitting, weird right</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like civet oil at all.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this oil which is less fragrant than Mumba.  Also oil has a sticky substance.  Will not order again because not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to what others are saying here about this item not being up to par. It smells AMAZING and lasts ALL DAY. You&#x27;d be a fool not to purchase from this seller. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> This in NO WAY Egyptian musk! It smells like a mixture of dollar store patchouli and toilet deodorizer! The oil is thick and rather sticky, so the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; seems to have some staying power, unfortunately. Would not purchase this product again! Ick and blech!</li>
            <li> Too strong.  Smells like Old Lady.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt this is pure and authentic Egyptian musk oil, BUT it smells so good. Very sexy scent:). word</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for! It is the Egyptian Musk from my youth that I couldn&#x27;t find ANYWHERE. Well, here it is! Just the right degree of fragrance, long lasting and rich aroma. If you&#x27;re looking for authentic Egyptian Musk, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item shipped quickly and received in a few days. I love instant gratification!</li>
            <li> One star, because when I opened the bag most of the oil spilled all over the plastic baggy it was enclosed in during delivery, The oil is too thick and sticky, and has a very very light scent, that does not stay or linger on for the whole day, It stays on for about 15 minutes or so, then the very light scent go&#x27;s away...would not recommend for anyone...</li>
            <li> no this is not what i wanted ....i am not happy</li>
            <li> Great oil. My husband uses it daily. I will be buying from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Great smell but a little diluted than what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The oil is fantastic just the smell I love to wear. I get compliments all the time on it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast. I was looking for a subtle musk oil so l purchased this one. One word LOUD okay very very LOUD.</li>
            <li> Not as good as &amp;#34;Kuumba made&amp;#34;, but OK.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what this scent is but it definitely is not musk oil.  Has a nasty chemical smell.  Bring back Coty musk oil.</li>
            <li> hardly can smell any musk</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 Egyptian musk oil from 2 different sellers on amazon. one is this one, and the latter is this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/HAIRSOFLY-PDT20-Egyptian-Musk-1oz/dp/B0057BS4LE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1406042389&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;egyptian+musk+oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 1oz, egyptian musk sold by HAIRSOFTLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this oil is much lighter in appearance and it&#x27;s smell differs from Hairsoftly. There is this very subtle so subtle that it is almost unnoticeable unless someone hugs you. I recommend mixing 3/4 of the bottle to a small vaseline jar that is already 1/4 used (so that mixing is easier). There&#x27;s this high pungent note in the fragrance that you smell when you rub it on. But it is fleeting. It comes and then goes. Throughout the day you do get that fleeting note. And it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this actually a year ago and I don&#x27;t use it everyday. Plus, the vaseline combo extends this bottles lifetime. A second reason why I did not write a review is because there is so many oils out there and I wanted to get at least one more until a write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as a first time Egyptian Musk Oil user to see if they like the scent, HOWEVER I personally recommend any repeating users to purchase my 2nd oil to refill this bottle (DONT THROW THIS BOTTLE AWAY REFILL RE-USE)</li>
            <li> Was not the same oil I received the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li> nice stuff smell great</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer with Natural Cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered this E Musk (Civet Blend) several and just ordered 2 more roll ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price or great customer service from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it says &#x27;pure&#x27; or &#x27;civet&#x27; is relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, if there WERE civet in it..you&#x27;d know it..as real civet smells like cat spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simple, affordable, lasts relatively well and I&#x27;ve added to my favorite E Musks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Time in California sells E Musk for $36 an oz, Attar Bazaar is more expensive and the price goes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend THIS musk based on its merit and worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other E Musk Body OIL I recommend is from Claudia&#x27;s Incense who bought out Smoking Joes...which is still being sold as Smoking Joes but really is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia&#x27;s Incense Egyptian Musk BODY OIL is only $20 for 1 oz with $4 shipping.  You will have to &#x27;Google&#x27; Smoking Joes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line....it smells like 1970s E Musk. Their body FRAGRANCE is lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with Natural Cosmetic along with the Claudia&#x27;s Incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Item is in glass bottle which is good, however it is a roll on, which IMO is not good for any essential oils. Product itself is nice- will be transferring it to an more appropriate container.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Not the same scent that I love. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected</li>
            <li> This stuff smells kind of \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; to me, but I suppose that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like? Lot more scent than I expected, kind of \\&quot;flowery?\\&quot; But, what came was a lot more (volume-wise) than I had expected and is certainly what I&#x27;d ordered. The oil is very thick, but the roller thing works as it should. The seller shipped out really, REALLY fast. From ordering to me getting it was three-days. Maybe because the PO was in a slow season, but still, they shipped fast and this is just what I ordered. Will update this in a week, depending on what others think of the smell on me, but like most of these things, it smells different on each person so it&#x27;s hard to judge the product for that.</li>
            <li> I used to frequent lounges, cultural events and gatherings of light-minded folks. I spent a lot of time in African Import stores and neo-jazzy spots with incense diffused throughout and ambient lighting to set the mood for intimate performances of spoken word, real hip hop and song. Egyptian musk was a staple. I have always gotten it from the same ghetto love shack for $5-$10 per roll-on bottle. Since having relocated, I am at a loss. This fragrance is akin to sweet baby powder and may very well have a place on my dresser. But it&#x27;s not the stimulating, transcendent perfume from the east of which I am in search. Thus, I carry on. Vigilant. Peace.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, lasts a long time. The bottle will last me for years, and it is priced well.  If I had to I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian Musk Oil might have been imported from Egypt but once they got it,  it was cut with way too much oil.....hardly any smell and it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This Egyptian musk oil wasn&#x27;t as fragrant as others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and rich egyptian musk. It is a great quality (NOT watered down with alcohol) and the price is really forgiving for such a long lasting scent. My neighbors loved the way i smelled so much they asked me to let them in on where i got my fragrance. I bought 2 more one for each of my neighbors to give as gifts. WE LOVE IT !!! The coolest thing about this oil is that it smells different on everyone. It mixes with your body&#x27;s own chemistry and BANG like magic it&#x27;s your very own unique blend. I put it on once a day and it stays on all day and all night. I love it !</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic  is really thick i had to remove the roller. Will recommend</li>
            <li> Not very strong and the oil is really thick.</li>
            <li> This product was far superior to the product I used in the past, Jovan Civet Oil.  This lasts much longer and the price is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Light scent that dissipates very quickly.  I bought Musk Oil while on a trip to Egypt and this is the closet I have come to the scent.  Too bad it is so diluted.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean, light fragrance that lasts.</li>
            <li> Product fragrance was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; nothing exceptional.  Also, oil seemed thick and hard to apply, did not roll on all that great, even after placing in warm water as suggested</li>
            <li> I have purchased better smelling musk oils.  This one is a bit &amp;#34;perfumey.&amp;#34;  But the applicator makes putting it on very easy. Price good. a</li>
            <li> Nice smell, wish it was a little stronger but I do love it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be wearing this fragrance, as it does not smell like the Egyptian Musk that I am used to. This one has some sort of flowery fragrance with the earthy fragrance. I&#x27;m not sure I even received the correct fragrance.</li>
            <li> wonderful smelling egyptian musk...bravo</li>
            <li> Hard to roll on... smell doesn&#x27;t last very long. But overall. Good</li>
            <li> Loved loved love it!!! I would buy it again and probably will!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this type of oil for years. The oil differs from seller to seller. This one smells good but the scent is gone literally in minutes. Time to find a different seller.. and so should you.</li>
            <li> The barest scent.. the stale oil smell is almost stronger than the scent..  total fail.  What did I expect for like $5?  I can hope right?  (additional) This does appear to be the genuine Egyptian Musk... if only they would add more to the oil they diluted it with??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Guys!, increase the egyptian musk in your product, send me an email or publish this fact and I&#x27;ll give you another go.  I would pay 2x the price if you would only add more of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hows that?</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for....nice thickness not watery and smells really good</li>
            <li> This IS exactly the sweet and warm Egyptian Musk scent I was searching for.  I am very pleased with the way it smells directly from the bottle and hours later.  I wish only that it was longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Smells awful! I had to throw this in the garbage as soon as I tried it because it smelled rotten! Waste of money</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved the smell</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> Will order again and again.  Thank you, Respectfully Mrs. M.T.S</li>
            <li> It was nice to have because I love musk, but I wish that the perfume would have been more lasting</li>
            <li> I dont know if its genuine or not.. Although this doesn&#x27;t stay for long, but as long as it stays its pleasure to smell it..</li>
            <li> The roller doesn&#x27;t work too well and the scent does not last very long. I do like the aroma but wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> not as long lasting  as I am used to.Would not order again. Also no label on bottle Would not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Okay fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would.Smells nice mixed with other fragrances</li>
            <li> Or very little aroma.  A musk oil is supposed to have Presence, and it is also&lt;br /&gt;supposed to enhance what one is already wearing, and get better as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alors, from what I remember, this one did not do that.</li>
            <li> I excitedly opened the package and applied it; that first and only time, it smelled good. Next day, applied again; couldn&#x27;t smell anything. Reapplied. Couldn&#x27;t smell anything. Noticed the roll-ball was dry; thinking it was defective, I removed it so I could use my finger to dab it on. But when I sniffed, there wasn&#x27;t any odor, and when I tipped it with my fingertip over the top, it felt extremely sticky, and was very thick; it reminded me of old cooking oil. Well, bummer, I wasted my money again.</li>
            <li> Now this is more my style very soft and subtle aroma not heavy or overbearing and i will definitly reorder</li>
            <li> Too strong and not soft as musk</li>
            <li> When discovering this product, loved the fragrant oil and scent lasts a long time.  Ordered two this time around.  Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> the bottle leaked during delivery but the roller does not work when i try to roll it on, i have to use it with out the roller.. not very impressed with this product</li>
            <li> This is ok,  I must like it better in the summer than in the winter, but I love egyptian musk.  Go A,com</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for we birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She really enjoys the smell of egyptian musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that she love it but the sent was really light</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like Egyptian Musk Oil</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Very floral and clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great smell...really like it</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t roll on well. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this oil think it&#x27;s watered down. Doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I use Auric Blends but give this a shot cause of the price. You get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> Smells great. The only problem is that the oil is so thick that I had to remove the roller, and unbeknownst to me a bunch of it spilled in my cosmetic bag, so I only have like a fourth of the bottle left. :-( and I just got it last Saturday.  I am going to put the rest in an alternate container / bottle.  That is my only complaint.  They need to get a better application process. Other than that, the scent is great.</li>
            <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t move</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> It smells great, but really hard to get out. The roller is really dry. If different packing, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The roller doesnt work well on the product but the oil is good.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed by this product.  It smelled great, but did not smell like the Egyptian Oil that I am very familiar with, nor did the scent last very long.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found my fav....</li>
            <li> not happy with the smell not e.musk</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil since I was 15 years old. And I tell you this is not it. The color of the oil was a light color and you really can&#x27;t smell it . I brought two and both r in the trash! Never again. I gave it a star because the shipping was great.</li>
            <li> This is the one! Look no further! I got this delivered about 3 weeks ago and its still on a jacket I wore that week! If loving you is wrong I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li> It smells better as it warms on your skin. The bottle leaked and oil got everywhere. I would not get this again, but it was not a terrible experience or anything.</li>
            <li> This oil is very interesting.  I can hardly smell it in the bottle but once I put it on it smells great.  I think I wish it was a tad stronger.  This is not the best EM I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> again tried to purchase Egyptian Musk Oil and found this one to be a waste of my money.  No scent  and would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not an over-powering aroma that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love Egyptian Musk, but it is hard to find good quaility oil! This oil is of GREAT quaility! I put a ilttle on my pulse points and go on with my day! I usually forget that I&#x27;m even wearing it until a random person stops me and asks me what I am wearing or that I smell good! If you like musk I definiely recommend this one! )</li>
            <li> Rich, bold but subtle, smells just like I remember it when I bought off a street vendor in the 90s. Clean and soft. Larger bottle than expected, and super fast delivery. Will purchase more from this vendor when the one I just bought runs low.</li>
            <li> the roll ball sucks the smell is good but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> Just received oil today (which was a quick delivery-thanks for that!) I have not tried Egyptian Musk oil since high school (26 yrs ago :0) and I have been wanting to try it again for a while but have not had a chance to get my hand on a good bottle of it.  I was too afraid of getting a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34;.  But I must say I&#x27;m wearing it now and I am L-O-V-I-N-G myself right about now!  I can kiss my own self. :)  I am soooo pleased and impressed! I am not going to wait until this is gone to reorder, I will be placing another order this week for 2 more bottles!!  If I could give it 6 stars I would!  Keep producing great quality oils!  A little goes a long way.  This is a keeper for sure!</li>
