            <li>But, it is ok...</li>
            <li>Even though I will still have to buy her a bigger box, I&#x27;m am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It really doesnt give good advertisement on size, until you place the order</li>
            <li>This fits all my makeup and it is easy to transport.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t fit all her stuff in it.</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I hoped for, however it can be used as a great travel kit for my girlfriend.</li>

            <li>but for now this is good &amp;&amp; cute pink,, highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li>If you have a few things to toss into it great, and you have to hold it from tipping over.</li>

            <li>The case is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>If you have lots of make-up you will need to buy a bigger make-up box, but if you have very few make-up items then this will be the perfect size for you.</li>
            <li>then i expected and is very easy to cart around</li>
            <li>If you have more makeup than can fit in a small makeup bag, then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>wish it was bigger can&#x27;t really fit anything.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have much makeup this is for you</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and came early</li>
            <li>but in enough to do a full face if I need to travel with it</li>
            <li>i love that its small does not take much space</li>
            <li>Well, I think it is cute &amp; small....</li>
            <li>I will just have to use it for something else other than what I had originally planned.</li>
            <li>this makeup case is cute but its wayyyyyyy too small.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a little Bigger, and in more colors.</li>
            <li>but i really do need a bigger 1</li>
            <li>,  I bought it for an adult for xmas and decided to give it to a kid...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but it is very small and I</li>
            <li>But bought them more for decoration any way (got pink, lavender, &amp; black). .</li>
            <li>It is made of very sturdy material and it has a lock that works well on it so other than the capacity</li>

            <li> But bought them more for decoration any way (got pink, lavender, &amp; black). .</li>
            <li> It is made of very sturdy material and it has a lock that works well on it so other than the capacity</li>
            <li> Item was much smaller than I thought as the measurements were shown with the case being opened and thus I expected the closed case to be the measurement size - as one normally does.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews said, MUCH smaller than you anticipate.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger than it actually is.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pink</li>
            <li> the expected she never used it once</li>
            <li> Like its way smaller then the small ones u see @ target...</li>
            <li> only but what I&#x27;m taking with me to travel for a few days and its still to little</li>
            <li> The key can sometimes be hard to put into the lock.</li>
            <li> The picture makes this box look big but its very small couldn&#x27;t hold half of the make up I have!</li>
            <li> I ended up giving mine to my little cousin.</li>
            <li> I have tons and tons of makeup and majority of it can not fit into this case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want a mini case</li>
            <li> I knew it would be small but not this small....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was a lot smaller</li>

            <li> Item was much smaller than I thought as the measurements were shown with the case being opened and thus I expected the closed case to be the measurement size - as one normally does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my make up case. It holds every peice of make up I own. And it&#x27;s so cute!!</li>
            <li> The case is exactly as described. I am using it to store all my \\&quot;lip\\&quot; make up products. I use a larger case for face and eyes. Product arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but it is very small and I only but what I&#x27;m taking with me to travel for a few days and its still to little but it&#x27;s pink I&#x27;m good lol</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews said, MUCH smaller than you anticipate. I was using it for shellac nail polish traveling but I ended up only being able to fit my nail accessories in it. Super cute though for the right items</li>
            <li> wish it was bigger can&#x27;t really fit anything. this product is not for freelance makeup artist you need something way bigger i wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> It is perfect. It is very fast shipping.The inside has three levels. It also has a mirror. IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 If you have lots of make-up you will need to buy a bigger make-up box, but if you have very few make-up items then this will be the perfect size for you. The key can sometimes be hard to put into the lock. When you travel it&#x27;ll be very easy to bring with you.The make-up box is very smooth. &#x27;&#x27;It&#x27;s pretty cute actually.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Is about the size of a lunch box.  So got what I paid for. But bought them more for decoration any way (got pink, lavender, &amp; black). .</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and came early</li>
            <li> This fits all my makeup and it is easy to transport. There are several compartments with a mirror. The mirror is helpful when I am not at home.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife thinking her makeup container was way outdated. Unfortunately this was a lot smaller the expected she never used it once couldn&#x27;t fit all her stuff in it.</li>
            <li> This may be my own fault for not checking out the dimensions of the case but it is very small. I use it on a regular basis however, it does the job. I have tons and tons of makeup and majority of it can not fit into this case. I do but in enough to do a full face if I need to travel with it and it works fine. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are expecting to pack alot of makeup into it. It is made of very sturdy material and it has a lock that works well on it so other than the capacity it is a very good travel case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and functional, from as far as I can tell. I thought it would be a little bigger than it actually is. I going to be part of christmas present and is serving its purpose at this point. Appears durable and has a lock which it probably needs so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally pop open in travel.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; train case, but It is really MIni I wish it were a little Bigger, and in more colors.</li>
            <li> My train case is amazing&lt;br /&gt;that is all :)&lt;br /&gt;makeup girl forever!!! It holds a lot more then i expected and is very easy to cart around</li>
            <li> I really love this case its awesome &amp;&amp; very practical i love that its small does not take much space but i really do need a bigger 1 but for now this is good &amp;&amp; cute pink,, highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> Well, I think it is cute &amp; small....for the price. But, it is ok...I will just have to use it for something else other than what I had originally planned. Did I say it was SMALL for the price paid....</li>
            <li> The picture makes this box look big but its very small couldn&#x27;t hold half of the make up I have! I ended up giving mine to my little cousin. If you don&#x27;t have much makeup this is for you but if you have a lot I would recommend you get something else.</li>
            <li> this makeup case is cute but its wayyyyyyy too small.  If you have more makeup than can fit in a small makeup bag, then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I broke my girlfriends last make up box. So I saw this one and purchased it. I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t know anything about makeup or the box it is stored in. The box seems durable and put together well. It was smaller than I hoped for, however it can be used as a great travel kit for my girlfriend. Even though I will still have to buy her a bigger box, I&#x27;m am very happy with my purchase. I definitely recommend this buy to others.</li>
            <li> This product was very small considering what it looks like.  If you have a few things to toss into it great, and you have to hold it from tipping over.</li>
            <li> love it - great for a tween/teen makeup</li>
            <li> I was not happy with its size.  It really doesnt give good advertisement on size, until you place the order and it says Mini Case.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want a mini case,  I bought it for an adult for xmas and decided to give it to a kid...</li>
