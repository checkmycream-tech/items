            <li>It was perfect because i didnt have to bother searching for something to wrap it in.</li>
            <li>So happy I can find it online!</li>
            <li>This face wash works very good and does not contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I have still gotten great results.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Arbonne products.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, these 2 products are the best on the market for very oily skin!</li>
            <li>TRY THIS product, I just know you will love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, clears up my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>And it delivers very quickly!</li>
            <li>MANY.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having this product it is the only thing that helps my acne and finding it at a good price is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently found another product that works great</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and lovely (peppermint, so it is invigorating in the morning)</li>
            <li>, it lathers nicely, and amazingly it does not over dry.</li>
            <li>Friends always tell me how nice and clear my skin is, and it&#x27;s because of this acne wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the other products in this line but perhaps I should; presumably they will enhance effects?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway as someone who has struggled for many many years with combination, acne-prone skin, I love this product and don&#x27;t plan to stop using it.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that keeps my face free of acne and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Product was recieved quickly.</li>
            <li>I was a customer prior to purchasing the acne products and I loved it so much that I gave the acne products a try.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face fresh and clean as well as controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that I do not sell Arbonne.</li>
            <li>It does take some time, results were pretty gradual.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The tube lasts a long time, as it does not take alot of product to clean the face.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just expensive.</li>
            <li>It made my stubborn acne on my cheeks and around my mouth almost completely disappear and the  blackheads around my hairline are gone also!</li>
            <li>The box-- a little bent but tube is fine.</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel super clean without being tight or dry.  </li>
            <li>So, on a friend&#x27;s suggestion I tried the Arbonne Clear Advantage set.</li>
            <li>I still like the Mia, but I&#x27;ve been using it with the Arbonne Clear Advantage wash in the shower and at night.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using it completely.</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS gone back because nothing keeps my skin as clear as Clear Advanatge.</li>
            <li>However, I have used this product for over 3 years and it&#x27;s the ONLY reason my skin is as clear as it is.</li>
            <li>It only worked a lil while, then the acne started going wild.  </li>
            <li>but I stuck to it for more than two months due to the whole &amp;#34;its gets worse before it gets better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I developed cystic acne on my neck and on my face upon using these products when all I initially wanted was to clear out some minor breakouts..</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this acne wash every day and literally if I put it on over night I can see a difference in the morning. It&#x27;s very good, clears up my skin quickly. Friends always tell me how nice and clear my skin is, and it&#x27;s because of this acne wash. Not to mention it&#x27;s all-natural.</li>
            <li> Best face wash on earth.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and it came wrapped as a gift. It was perfect because i didnt have to bother searching for something to wrap it in. A lil difficult while im here in Iraq. :)</li>
            <li> I have strayed in the past but always come back to Arbonne Clear Advantage. It is the only product that keeps my face free of acne and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Arbonne products.  They make your skin feel super clean without being tight or dry.  This product is no exception.  The tube lasts a long time, as it does not take alot of product to clean the face.  I&#x27;ve recently found another product that works great -- Loreal Go360 -- it also contains 1% salicylic acid and dissolves facial oil like this product.  In my opinion, these 2 products are the best on the market for very oily skin!</li>
            <li> I developed cystic acne on my neck and on my face upon using these products when all I initially wanted was to clear out some minor breakouts..What a huge disappointment :( Thank goodness my dermatologist cleared out the damage that it had caused my face. I will never ever try anything from Arbonne ever again.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that I do not sell Arbonne. However, I have used this product for over 3 years and it&#x27;s the ONLY reason my skin is as clear as it is. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and needed something to keep my very oily skin from breaking out. I had tried everything, including Proactiv. Although Proactiv worked somewhat I didn&#x27;t like all of the abuse my sheets and towels took from the ingredient that bleaches everything. So, on a friend&#x27;s suggestion I tried the Arbonne Clear Advantage set. I was totally amazed. Within just a few days my skin was so much clearer and healthier. If there&#x27;s such a thing as a miracle product for acne, this is it!!!! I do have to say that I only use the wash and toner. I do not use the spot treatment or the vitamins and I have still gotten great results. Occasionally after starting the Arbonne Clear Advantage products, I have strayed and tried other things, such as Benefit, Clinique, and Philosophy. I have ALWAYS gone back because nothing keeps my skin as clear as Clear Advanatge. Recently, I bought a Mia Sonic face brush and used the acne treatment that came with it. Within a week or so, my skin was back to breaking out again. I still like the Mia, but I&#x27;ve been using it with the Arbonne Clear Advantage wash in the shower and at night. Again, what a difference. TRY THIS product, I just know you will love it!</li>
            <li> My youngest son is entering puberty.  I&#x27;ve tried every acne product on the market for my 3 boys and nothing works like this does.  Within 3 uses, there was a noticeable improvement!</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Helps stop upcoming pimples!</li>
            <li> My son has terrible acne and I purchased the Arboone acne care products and his skin looks wonderful.  I was a customer prior to purchasing the acne products and I loved it so much that I gave the acne products a try.  Again, I loooove Arbonne skin care products!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few acne products I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works. It does take some time, results were pretty gradual. I&#x27;ve used about half a bottle (diligently, twice a day) and can now say that areas of blemishes on my face are just about gone. I&#x27;ve tried SO. MANY. PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say why this works - the active ingredient is a very common one - but it does. It smells fresh and lovely (peppermint, so it is invigorating in the morning), it lathers nicely, and amazingly it does not over dry. I don&#x27;t use the other products in this line but perhaps I should; presumably they will enhance effects?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway as someone who has struggled for many many years with combination, acne-prone skin, I love this product and don&#x27;t plan to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product it is the only thing that helps my acne and finding it at a good price is nice</li>
            <li> It only worked a lil while, then the acne started going wild.  It made my skin worse every time I used it.  I have stopped using it completely.</li>
            <li> Great product, just expensive. Only reason for the 4 out of 5.  No reason to write a book on this its a face wash</li>
            <li> Cleans very well. Acne clears with use twice a day. When I don&#x27;t use it, my skin continues to have break outs. Product was recieved quickly. The box-- a little bent but tube is fine. I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed and upset by a product before. I started using it and noticed my acne was just getting worse and worse but I stuck to it for more than two months due to the whole &amp;#34;its gets worse before it gets better&amp;#34; philosophy. My acne never improved, but just got increasingly severe. Three months since I ended it I am still suffering the consequences of this horrible product: my face is covered in red marks that won&#x27;t go away and I have a few indents in my skin from bad pimples.</li>
            <li> I having been using this arbonne wash for years. Keeps my face fresh and clean as well as controls my adult acne. So happy I can find it online! And it delivers very quickly!</li>
            <li> This face wash works very good and does not contain harmful chemicals. I have purchase it three times now, so it is not something I have used once. I use it at night and in the morning and my face has cleared up.</li>
            <li> It made my stubborn acne on my cheeks and around my mouth almost completely disappear and the  blackheads around my hairline are gone also!</li>
