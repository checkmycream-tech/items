            <li>In all, I really love this mascara</li>
            <li>Not to sure about this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be able to wear mascara again until I took a chance and purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>I can get better results with my L&#x27;Oreal or Neutrogena mascaras.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check the expiration date on each of their products before using them</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is also a conditioner which my lashes are in need of.</li>
            <li>It also washes away easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It does not clump, it glides on easily and evenly just like it states on the packaging.</li>

            <li>Also, it washes off easily without breaking my lashes.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend it for women who would like to take better care of their eyelashes and still use mascara without worrying about causing any more damage.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s non-waterproof it washes off really easily with just warm water and soap which is pretty nice after a long day.</li>
            <li>It has many moisturizing ingredients including vitamins and all natural oils (which I am a fan of)!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li>company was also nice enough to include a mini nourishing cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara!</li>
            <li>glad I did some searching, because I found this mascara and saw that it’s more nourishing than the typical drugstore mascara</li>
            <li>I normally get Ulta mascara since it’s cheap.</li>
            <li>It will go on smooth and look very natural.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions and apply the second coat before the first one dries.</li>
            <li>i found this mascara super easy to take off, which is good because it would be pointless to use products to encourage lash growth only to have lashes be damaged/broken when you try to take the product off.</li>
            <li>My best friends was sad and depressed after her lashes started thinning and falling, which I didn&#x27;t know as such a huge deal for a girl.</li>
            <li>It applies easy, thickens and no clumps or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use the conditioner because of recent cataract surgery, but found no irritation or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, lasts all day and at the end of the day when it is time to take off it washes away easily with soap, no scrubbing necessary.</li>
            <li>Also looks great on, just as good as any other high-quality mascara but without the harsh chemicals those other products contain.</li>
            <li>this mascara really helps enhance the longer, thicker lashes i have now after using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works..</li>
            <li>It really highlights my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>the brush holder is long so its easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I love the way mascara highlights my eyes, but by the end of the day I always end up with raccoon eyes due to smudging as I rub my eyes throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The mascara is not waterproof but it stays just fine all day long.</li>
            <li>I use it with their eyelash conditioner, which is good because using the mascara actually encouraged me to keep using the eyelash conditioner - I could totally see the tiny baby lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought the Jet Black color and love it.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t dry and they stay smooth.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>It does not smudge and comes off with a normal amount of eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and the I-Max mascara does not irritate them.</li>
            <li>I purchased two tubes of this mascara at different times believing the first one a mistake.  </li>
            <li>The first one was totally unusable....dry and cakey.</li>
            <li>I returned the first one and purchased the second.</li>
            <li>But since it was for her birthday, she decided to really give it a try and use them daily.</li>
            <li>This mascara has replaced my old ones.</li>
            <li>I started to use the mascara recently after I noticed that the Conditioner product worked really well and made my lashes longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I also believe it protects and nourishes young lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive, especially on windy days.</li>
            <li>barely anything comes out of the tube, what did come out</li>
            <li>I will probably go back to my old brand because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;No irritating, no problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT dry like someone reported.</li>
            <li>Try this out if you find other mascaras irritating, I like this more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>Unlike dry and clumpy waterproof formulas, I Max provides flexible and natural looking coverage.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I spent days reading and comparing different reviews, and I am very surprised for the conditions of this product.</li>
            <li>I am totally upset because it is all dry and impossible to use , I consider it a rip off, and as far as I live outside the U.S. Return it will cost even more money than the product in fact.</li>

            <li> My tube seems old and dried out even though it was just opened.</li>
            <li> I would like to say this product if you want to get and keep your long and silky eyelash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mascara arrived dry as if the tube had been opened for years.</li>
            <li> Maybe it has something to do with the fact that its non-waterproof, it has less irritants overall.</li>
            <li> It did seem to dry out quicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This formula is very dry.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said you could remove with soap and water but even after I washed my face multiple times I still had black mascara around my eyes...</li>
            <li> The waterproof ones are harder on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> received a new product after the first one was in bad condition.</li>
            <li> I got the eyeliner, eyelash conditioner and conditioning mascara combo per other friends recommendation.</li>
            <li> My other friends picked out the color which they say would match with that friend&#x27;s lash color and skin tone well.</li>
            <li> It isn’t waterproof but it doesn’t smudge like other non-waterproof products.</li>
            <li> And she said as a bonus, she didn&#x27;t get any problems like the irritation to eyes or dark circle under the eyes like other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t give my lashes volume like other mascaras, it is makes my lashes look neat and dark.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Completely dried up tube of mascara, flakes and clumps</li>
            <li> It was extremely dried out.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MASCARA.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I thought and it dried up almost immediately.</li>
            <li> im not sure why the other reviewer said this product is hard to take off.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is very thick and dry feeling.</li>
            <li> My friend was skeptical about the products cause apparently all the past efforts didn&#x27;t return any results.</li>
            <li> I usually wear very little makeup</li>
            <li> I used it about 10 times and it completely dried out!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> so I put a small amount on</li>
            <li> and it definitely is less irritating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if there is even anything on the wand.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply and looks clumpy.</li>
            <li> She slowly lost her confidence and started to isolate herself from friends.</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrible - very dry consistency, does not go on easily, and then is almost impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid mascara user, so I decided to give this a try, with the terrible conditioner that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> Quiet disappointed...</li>
            <li> However, I decided to change it up this time, since I had problems with the mascara irritating my eyes and clumping during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to stop wearing my other mascara because it got way too irritating and painful to my eyes.</li>
            <li> The mascara also isn&#x27;t difficult wipe off.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts, and based on reviews- non irritating?!  </li>
            <li> Horrible, very dry and</li>
            <li> This is the WORST mascara I have ever used!</li>

            <li> My best friends was sad and depressed after her lashes started thinning and falling, which I didn&#x27;t know as such a huge deal for a girl. She slowly lost her confidence and started to isolate herself from friends. To boost her confidence I got the eyeliner, eyelash conditioner and conditioning mascara combo per other friends recommendation. My other friends picked out the color which they say would match with that friend&#x27;s lash color and skin tone well. My friend was skeptical about the products cause apparently all the past efforts didn&#x27;t return any results. But since it was for her birthday, she decided to really give it a try and use them daily. And they actually worked! She said she started noticing a difference in the length and thickness of her lashes in just a month and long and is still growing longer and thicker by the day. :] And she said as a bonus, she didn&#x27;t get any problems like the irritation to eyes or dark circle under the eyes like other products.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with the results and I  can&#x27;t be any happier for the purchase. :]</li>
            <li> This formula is very dry. It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if there is even anything on the wand. I Did not purchase the eyelash conditioner, Maybe that would help.</li>
            <li> My tube seems old and dried out even though it was just opened. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Its crappy, and clumpy. getemcc</li>
            <li> Completely dried up tube of mascara, flakes and clumps</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;No irritating, no problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased two tubes of this mascara at different times believing the first one a mistake.  The first one was totally unusable....dry and cakey. I returned the first one and purchased the second. It was extremely dried out. I couldn&#x27;t get any mascara out of the tube. I threw it away. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MASCARA.</li>
            <li> I spent days reading and comparing different reviews, and I am very surprised for the conditions of this product. I am totally upset because it is all dry and impossible to use , I consider it a rip off, and as far as I live outside the U.S. Return it will cost even more money than the product in fact.</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrible - very dry consistency, does not go on easily, and then is almost impossible to get off.  Other reviewers said you could remove with soap and water but even after I washed my face multiple times I still had black mascara around my eyes...</li>
            <li> i purchased this mascara w/ the eyelash conditioner (which is also great).  this mascara really helps enhance the longer, thicker lashes i have now after using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it isnt waterproof, which is okay with me.  im not sure why the other reviewer said this product is hard to take off.  i found this mascara super easy to take off, which is good because it would be pointless to use products to encourage lash growth only to have lashes be damaged/broken when you try to take the product off.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. My eyes are very sensitive, especially on windy days. I really love wearing mascara because it enhances my eye beauty. The best part is, I forgot I was wearing it. It is so comfortable with my eyes. It is not waterproof, but I never noticed any smudging.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. Ever since I started wearing contact lens&#x27; I had to stop wearing my other mascara because it got way too irritating and painful to my eyes. I bought this after hearing about how non-irritating it was and decided to try it out since it was only $10 and it definitely is less irritating. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that its non-waterproof, it has less irritants overall. I bought the Jet Black color and love it. Because it&#x27;s non-waterproof it washes off really easily with just warm water and soap which is pretty nice after a long day. Try this out if you find other mascaras irritating, I like this more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It&#x27;s NOT dry like someone reported. It applies easy, thickens and no clumps or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use the conditioner because of recent cataract surgery, but found no irritation or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I love the gold packaging.</li>
            <li> I would like to say this product if you want to get and keep your long and silky eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;It really works..it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> These I Max products are great. They do not irritate my eyes at all which is just one of many amazing features about them. The mascara is not waterproof but it stays just fine all day long. It also washes away easily with soap and water. I don&#x27;t have to scrub at my eyes or use makeup remover which defeats the purpose of using lash growth and conditioning products. It does not clump, it glides on easily and evenly just like it states on the packaging. Also looks great on, just as good as any other high-quality mascara but without the harsh chemicals those other products contain. It feels good, almost like I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all. In all, I really love this mascara and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s high-quality packaging and ingredients. Another good thing about the mascara is that you get quite a lot of product for the price. I highly recommend it for women who would like to take better care of their eyelashes and still use mascara without worrying about causing any more damage.</li>
            <li> Not to sure about this product. I used it once and nothing seemed to be on my lashes! Went back to using my store bought mascara.</li>
            <li> This is THE ONLY mascara that I can wear that does not irritate my eyes -- no kidding.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be able to wear mascara again until I took a chance and purchased this product.  I&#x27;m amazed with it!  I&#x27;ll definitely be a return buyer.  I highly recommend it for sensitive eyes like mine.</li>
            <li> I like to use the I-MAX mascara with the eyelash conditioner because it is non-water proof, which is quite easy to wash off. I have very sensitive eyes and the I-Max mascara does not irritate them. I apply two coats. Make sure you follow the directions and apply the second coat before the first one dries. It will go on smooth and look very natural. Even though it is not waterproof, it does not smudged, and it last all day long. The mascara works as a protective coat over the I-MAX conditioner, which has grown my lashes tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both the I-MAX mascara and conditioner. I honestly love, love, love them!</li>
            <li> I normally get Ulta mascara since it’s cheap. However, I decided to change it up this time, since I had problems with the mascara irritating my eyes and clumping during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m glad I did some searching, because I found this mascara and saw that it’s more nourishing than the typical drugstore mascara so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mascara for a while now and am very pleased with it. It really highlights my eyelashes. Another plus, is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the mascara doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes after I sweat from a workout (I know, I know…I should have washed it off…oops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company was also nice enough to include a mini nourishing cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love the way mascara highlights my eyes, but by the end of the day I always end up with raccoon eyes due to smudging as I rub my eyes throughout the day. However, this mascara is smudge-proof just as it states! Unlike dry and clumpy waterproof formulas, I Max provides flexible and natural looking coverage.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice addition to I max conditioner. In one application it elongates the lashes without any smudging.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST mascara I have ever used! I am an avid mascara user, so I decided to give this a try, with the terrible conditioner that goes along with it. I used it about 10 times and it completely dried out! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara keeps my eyelashes beautiful! They aren&#x27;t dry and they stay smooth. The mascara also isn&#x27;t difficult wipe off. This mascara has replaced my old ones. I love it!</li>
            <li> Horrible, very dry and barely anything comes out of the tube, what did come out it was in a big clump! It went into the garbage! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It does not smudge and comes off with a normal amount of eye makeup remover.  It stays on until you want to remove it.  There is no reason to buy waterproof mascara when you can use this.  The waterproof ones are harder on my eyelashes.  It did seem to dry out quicker than I expected.  I wish it came in dark brown.  I will probably go back to my old brand because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Product overprice for quality delivered. I can get better results with my L&#x27;Oreal or Neutrogena mascaras.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this mascara along with the I Max Conditioner as a present about a month ago.  I started to use the mascara recently after I noticed that the Conditioner product worked really well and made my lashes longer and thicker.  The mascara is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge, and lasts all day.  Also, it washes off easily without breaking my lashes.  Two thumbs up! - submitted by wife</li>
            <li> Mascara arrived dry as if the tube had been opened for years. I could not use this product and therefore do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very thick and dry feeling. It is hard to apply and looks clumpy. I ordered it because it was recommended to use with the eyelash conditioner to help you eyelashes grow, but I do not like it and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> received a new product after the first one was in bad condition.The product spreads easily on the lashes and lasts for a good time. Make sure you check the expiration date on each of their products before using them</li>
            <li> i bought this together with the eyelash conditioner as a combo and both products have been great. the mascara doesnt smear but it washes off easily when im washing my face. the brush holder is long so its easy to use as well. great product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I thought and it dried up almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. It looks great on and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I usually wear very little makeup so I put a small amount on and it&#x27;s just enough. I love the fact that it is also a conditioner which my lashes are in need of. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, lasts all day and at the end of the day when it is time to take off it washes away easily with soap, no scrubbing necessary. So far I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I was happy with the brow conditioner from this company. It has many moisturizing ingredients including vitamins and all natural oils (which I am a fan of)! Imax conditioning mascara works great, goes on easy, and comes off nicely with with witch hazel. It separates the lashes so they don&#x27;t clump. It is not waterproof though.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Appeared to disappear within 1-2 hours after application.  I wear contacts, and based on reviews- non irritating?!  Not my experience.  Quiet disappointed...</li>
            <li> I use it with their eyelash conditioner, which is good because using the mascara actually encouraged me to keep using the eyelash conditioner - I could totally see the tiny baby lashes. I also believe it protects and nourishes young lashes. Although it doesn&#x27;t give my lashes volume like other mascaras, it is makes my lashes look neat and dark.  It isn’t waterproof but it doesn’t smudge like other non-waterproof products. The best thing about it is that the brush is very easy to clean. Love this mascara!</li>
