            <li>Perfect for toner!</li>
            <li>and it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the amazing product!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice for the price !!  </li>
            <li>These work great as toner applicators instead of cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The price is excellent from this seller, so I&#x27;m giving the product the benefit of my own doubts and relying on the fact that others have use for them.</li>
            <li>These are a great deal and great product.</li>
            <li>Great for removing my makeup and applying my toner every night.</li>
            <li>Really great for taking off nail polish,too.</li>
            <li>They are soft but incredibly strong also for how many you get, the value is awesome!</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again!  :)</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I use these for applying skin toner and they are so much better than the cotton cosmetic pads available at drug stores.</li>
            <li>Delivery time is so fast, and products were good</li>
            <li>These wipes really help me do an effective job to make sure my puppies are clean every day.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed, however, so they are a fine product in that regard.</li>
            <li>These non-woven wipes are lint free.</li>
            <li>Whereas with the cotton squares the dogs would squirm and fight me (because it would take longer, and more wiping to really clean their eyes/snouts), these wipes are so efficient and gentle</li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft and very strong...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about these, but then again, I don&#x27;t remove nail polish nor do I get facials or peels and need to apply -- something??</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Ordered these to use with Rodan and Fields toner, they are very similar to the ones R&amp;F sells, but you get more and lower price.  </li>
            <li>If you read what it says on the package which is shown in the pic I uploaded, that is the exact reason why I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I brought whole bunch of similar one from Korea and LOVE these single-ply cotton wipes.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t waste toner, but they are also very effective and strong, so they apply toner to skin nicely without tearing, pulling, pilling or leaving tiny cotton pieces behind on skin.</li>
            <li>I wet them with saline solution to make sure I don&#x27;t irritate their eyes.  </li>
            <li>all of the puppies just stand still, as they know how fast it will be.</li>
            <li>Well prices, well packaged, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These are way, wayyyyyy better than typical drugstore cotton pads for applying toner.</li>
            <li>Here are my own choice of go-to all-around awesome cotton pads that don&#x27;t soak up my expensive potions and lotions, they don&#x27;t shed but are thick enough to use to apply foundation or powder -- DHC Silky Cotton:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I decided to give this particular one a try</li>
            <li>Normally I would have bought a new bottle of toner every 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>Now if you can find a good use for something so thin, almost like gauze in texture, then you may like them.</li>
            <li>Very soft on my face.</li>
            <li>I like using toner and never realized how much I must have been wasting prior to using these.</li>
            <li>Soft and lush.</li>
            <li>I have four little dogs, and I use these to clean their eyes/snouts every morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to gently clean the corners of their eyes without leaving any fibers behind, which was sometimes a problem with typical cotton squares.  </li>
            <li>Mornings are a quick snout swipe for each dog, a few minutes of brushing, and then off to breakfast.  </li>
            <li>These have a nice texture but they&#x27;re VERY thin (actually folded into quarters in the package), so I tried putting powder on with them.</li>
            <li>Barely absorbant, so most of your expensive product goes onto your face instead of getting soaked up by the gauze</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are thin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the thickness..too thin for me</li>

            <li> These work great as toner applicators instead of cotton balls.  Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price !!  Convenient for my profession !!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it with Eye Envy for our little dog.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Delivery time is so fast, and products were good</li>
            <li> This is my third order and I will never go back to cotton balls again. I like using toner and never realized how much I must have been wasting prior to using these. My 16oz bottle of toner lasted me 3 month&#x27;s. My daughter was also using the same bottle of toner. Normally I would have bought a new bottle of toner every 3 weeks! I cannot express what a great product this is!!</li>

Four paws up!</li>
            <li> I use these for cleaning my nails before a polish job.  While these do leave less lint than the typical cotton squares I did find that I still had stray fuzz strings I had to pull off my nails.</li>

            <li> These are way, wayyyyyy better than typical drugstore cotton pads for applying toner. These are thin so they don&#x27;t waste toner, but they are also very effective and strong, so they apply toner to skin nicely without tearing, pulling, pilling or leaving tiny cotton pieces behind on skin. I used to pay much more $$$ for an expensive department store brand of cotton pads that are IDENTICAL to these. I kid you not ...... identical. Did so for years. I feel like a sucker now, because all along I could have been buying these for a fraction of the price. These are a great deal and great product. Will purchase again!  :)</li>
            <li> I use these for applying skin toner and they are so much better than the cotton cosmetic pads available at drug stores. I&#x27;ve tired several different drug store brands of cotton pads and they all leave behind bits of lint on the skin. These non-woven wipes are lint free. Plus these wipes hold their shape and don&#x27;t over-absorb the toner, thus eliminating wasteful use of toner each time.</li>
            <li> Ordered these to use with Rodan and Fields toner, they are very similar to the ones R&amp;F sells, but you get more and lower price.  Very soft on my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent pads for putting on Toner it doesn&#x27;t soak it all up and waste it</li>

            <li> Wonderfully soft and very strong...</li>
            <li> Work well for  any application that you don&#x27;t want shedding of the material.</li>
            <li> Perfect for toner! Barely absorbant, so most of your expensive product goes onto your face instead of getting soaked up by the gauze like you would see with regular cotton rounds. And there&#x27;s no dripping!</li>
            <li> Changed the packaging. Don&#x27;t like the thickness..too thin for me</li>
            <li> Love these. Been using them for years. Unlike cotton, they don&#x27;t absorb and waste your expensive skincare products. Soft and lush. Really great for taking off nail polish,too. Well prices, well packaged, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you read what it says on the package which is shown in the pic I uploaded, that is the exact reason why I purchased this. I brought whole bunch of similar one from Korea and LOVE these single-ply cotton wipes. I even soak this in my toner and put it on my lips for dry-lip treatment. I decided to give this particular one a try and it is just perfect. I will order a bunch so they can last for a while. Thank you for the amazing product!!!!!</li>
