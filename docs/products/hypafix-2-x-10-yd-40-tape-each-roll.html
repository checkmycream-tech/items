            <li>Quick Delivery, Fair Price</li>
            <li>/&gt;She seems to be ok with this</li>
            <li>I use the hypafix and am able to remove the dressing without causing more damage to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing price, quick shipping, and the product works, so</li>
            <li>I love hypafix because I have been on steroids (for my crohns disease) and Coumadin and my skin tears easily.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly stretchy so it works perfectly on the knee as it doesn&#x27;t pop off when the knee bends.</li>
            <li>It stayed exactly where I put it...doesn&#x27;t pucker when my knee is straight, and stays on until I easily pull it off without sticking to the silicone strips.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>

            <li>Gentle and flexible.</li>
            <li>The first time was for the granddaughters, second time for the grandsons.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s like a sawing action against the stringy adhesive.)</li>
            <li>My baby has sensitive skin and her skin oozes with every other kind of adhesive, it seems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After you start to peel a little bit and can get to the underside, use oil on your fingertip and  rub at right angles to the direction of the tape to help get the adhesive to let go.</li>

            <li> Let it soak for a while and go slowly.</li>

            <li> I WAS TOLD BY A PRODUCT CARRIER THAT THIS TAPE WAS 90 or 100 DOLLARS! I CHECKED AMAZON AND&lt;br /&gt;FOUND IT FOR A LOW LOW PRICE! IT REALLY WORKS WELL NOT ONLY FOR WOUND BANDAGING BUT ALOT OF THINGS.  THANK YOU AMAZON.</li>
            <li> the tape work exactly the way it should be</li>
            <li> A good as advertised!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Delivery time was right on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired RN and was recently visiting a friend who was to undergo surgery. She became concerned about a drainage tube she would go home with and have for some weeks. She is allergic to adhesives and having a hard time in the hospital. I went on Amazon and ordered this that very day so it would arrive before she needed a dressing change. We used it for dressing changes and reinforcements for the entire 6 weeks and she never had 1 reaction or problem. She now says she plans to carry a roll with her if she&#x27;s ever hospitalized again and keep it in her room for nurses to use to tape down her IV&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought these. The first time was for the granddaughters, second time for the grandsons. They are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> My baby has sensitive skin and her skin oozes with every other kind of adhesive, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;She seems to be ok with this and we use it to keep her cannula on. We use Earth Momma Angel Baby oil to get it off. Let it soak for a while and go slowly. After you start to peel a little bit and can get to the underside, use oil on your fingertip and  rub at right angles to the direction of the tape to help get the adhesive to let go. (It&#x27;s like a sawing action against the stringy adhesive.) Keep reoiling your finger if you seem to have difficulty after a while of progress. And hang in there!</li>
            <li> Provided best value for this product. Hypafix is a fantastic product and this seller provided exactly as advertised at a great price!</li>
            <li> FINALLY found a tape that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Amazing price, quick shipping, and the product works, so I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> wonderful product easy to use</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery, Fair Price</li>
            <li> This tape is expensive but it is well worth the money.  It is much less expensive purchased thru Amazon.  If you have a wound or had surgery that needs to remain covered this is the tape you need.  Ann</li>
            <li> I love hypafix because I have been on steroids (for my crohns disease) and Coumadin and my skin tears easily.  I use the hypafix and am able to remove the dressing without causing more damage to my skin.  Great product</li>
            <li> Best tape I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gentle and flexible.</li>
            <li> I recently had knee replacement surgery and I&#x27;m using Circa Care silicone strips on my knee to reduce the look of the scar.  They tend to rub off on clothing or while sleeping.  I tried all kinds of dressings and/or tape and then found this gem.  It is slightly stretchy so it works perfectly on the knee as it doesn&#x27;t pop off when the knee bends. It stayed exactly where I put it...doesn&#x27;t pucker when my knee is straight, and stays on until I easily pull it off without sticking to the silicone strips.  This stuff is wonderful!  I&#x27;m now going to try it on my granddog&#x27;s little booboo on his leg.  I&#x27;ll not use anything else from here on out.</li>
