            <li>Absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>I think this is more a spring and summer lotion because its very light</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how cheap this is!)</li>
            <li>I actually love all three of the Jergens body creams that were released in 2012 in jars (coconut milk, oatmeal, and</li>
            <li>It is one of the reasons I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad they are selling this online and</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, not too strong or perfumey.  </li>
            <li>It is the greatest product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
            <li>This product works, but the strong smell of coconut is so off-putting to me that I threw it out.</li>
            <li>So happy I finally found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands/feet overly greasy but does leave them smooth, hydrated and moisturized.</li>
            <li>well moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt; if you want your skin smooth</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so smooth nor has it been so well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance smells so good but is not overpowering which is also a plus for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very absorbing and good smelling really leaving the skin</li>
            <li>and I am beyond excited.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments on how soft my skin was after many hours without reapplying.</li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff smell absolutely bewitching, but it hydrates like a DREAM.</li>
            <li>I received my package earlier than estimated which is always good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m painfully aware that petrolatum isn&#x27;t one of the best ingredients, which is why I don&#x27;t use it, or mineral oil, in my hair except in dire situations (summer humidity is completely disrespectful to my twists), so I&#x27;m trying to cut back, but...</li>
            <li>body cream is super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses it on her tummy and she is 8 months pregnant and hasn&#x27;t gotten a stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I put some of this stuff on my face after washing it, and my skin feels dewy and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels, the way it smells, and how soft and touchable my skin becomes after slathering it on.</li>
            <li>I have spent large amounts of money on the boutique/salon lotions and this is even better and more affordable.  </li>
            <li>so I bought their whole inventory which was 6 jars.  </li>
            <li>This makes means it is much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I like the product it really works for</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel silk soft ALL DAY!!!</li>
            <li>I used sooo many creams for my sensitive and super dry african skin and nothing worked until now.</li>
            <li>I went through this pretty quickly, but it is very thick (I have very dry skin) and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this would have a little more oil in it because of the shea mix.</li>
            <li>Since it is a cream I only use it for my hands and feet leaving them super soft and hydrated throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and works well on elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t really concerned about petrolatum, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
            <li>but it not heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greesy at all and absorbes completely.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion INSTANTLY smooths your skin and makes it feel hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me all of the major stores near me were either out of stock or did not carry the product including the place I originally bought it from.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> when i recieved my jergens, i ordered two they were a little messy in the package. but they smelled so great. i had been looking for this everywhere couldnt find them. it only takes a little on the skin bc its thick but it feels really nice and smells good i only need it at night, wouldnt wear it with body spray or perfume bc the sents would probaby clash. its a good product.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would have a little more oil in it because of the shea mix. It works, but not good for the winter though. I think this is more a spring and summer lotion because its very light</li>
            <li> I am sooo angry I havent used this for 20 years!!!!!! It&#x27;s heaven sent. Your skin will feel silk soft ALL DAY!!! I used sooo many creams for my sensitive and super dry african skin and nothing worked until now. Its absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion with best fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Super hydrating and creamy!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and great for the skin without be greasy.  The smell is very nice as well!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Jergens decided not to sell the coconut on the open market since it is in such demand.  I used to purchase at CVS and was told that it was discontinued so I bought their whole inventory which was 6 jars.  It is the greatest product for dry skin.  Just when you think nothing is going to help, this will do the trick.  It is very absorbing and good smelling really leaving the skin well moisturized and smooth.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works, but the strong smell of coconut is so off-putting to me that I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep your skin hydrated and smelling delicious for a VERY long time! I received many compliments on how soft my skin was after many hours without reapplying. It is a little heavy when you first put it on, but that might be why it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I searched the lotion aisle like a detective because I stumbled upon this lotion! This lotion INSTANTLY smooths your skin and makes it feel hydrated and soft. The dewy/hydrated feeling lasts so long! All day long! The smell is so amazing, it&#x27;s hard to not keep smelling my skin. It&#x27;s a very subtle coconut smell mixed with something else I can&#x27;t describe. I have never liked Jergens lotions but I must say this is a must have for me! I am someone who HAS to apply lotion every day or else I turn into a desert floor. It hydrates, it smooths, it smells amazing...it needs to be part of your lotion arsenal! (Picked this up at Walmart for $5.68. They also have the shea butter kind too! Can&#x27;t believe how cheap this is!)</li>
            <li> Wonderfully hydrating cream  Love it.</li>
            <li> I recently found this body cream and I am beyond excited.  I actually love all three of the Jergens body creams that were released in 2012 in jars (coconut milk, oatmeal, and aloe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cream, not a lotion.  This makes means it is much thicker.  Hence the jat and not a bottle.  It is one of the reasons I love this product.  I am tired of bottles where you cannot get all of the product out.  Because I have lupus (causes arthritis-like issues in my hands) the jars are the best for me.  It is too difficult to try and squeeze a bottle or work the pump for the last few drops of your lotion.  Here you just open the wide jar and dip your fingers in - Presto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body cream is super moisturizing.  It smells great and keeps my skin soft all day.  It is a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Jergens.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***One suggestion - Try buying this product at a place like Target.  I usually pay around $5-$6 dollars a jar.</li>
            <li> Jergens lotion..what can I say?  It is coconut too!  Smells great ,not greasy and . you skin feels good...all in the jar...done!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best.  Keeps skin soft and works well on elbows and knees.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff smell absolutely bewitching, but it hydrates like a DREAM. I put some of this stuff on my face after washing it, and my skin feels dewy and fresh all day. I&#x27;m painfully aware that petrolatum isn&#x27;t one of the best ingredients, which is why I don&#x27;t use it, or mineral oil, in my hair except in dire situations (summer humidity is completely disrespectful to my twists), so I&#x27;m trying to cut back, but...this is making it extremely difficult. I love the way it feels, the way it smells, and how soft and touchable my skin becomes after slathering it on. If you aren&#x27;t really concerned about petrolatum, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I live in a very dry climate and am extremely picky about lotions, scents, etc.  And this is almost perfect!  The scent is nice and light, not too strong or perfumey.  Sadly it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts!  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency; you can feel that it is on but it not heavy or sticky.  It has really helped with my dry skin.  I have spent large amounts of money on the boutique/salon lotions and this is even better and more affordable.  You won&#x27;t be sorry about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I went through this pretty quickly, but it is very thick (I have very dry skin) and smells amazing! Light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream lotion is amazing. It smells great , provides excellent moisture for both winter and summer months. It&#x27;s not greesy at all and absorbes completely. I would recommend this product and vendor.</li>
            <li> I like the product it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt; if you want your skin smooth i recommend Jergens Crema.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a drug store on a whim a few months ago.  I was looking for something to keep my hands and feet from being too dry and rough.  This cream works so well!  Since it is a cream I only use it for my hands and feet leaving them super soft and hydrated throughout the day.  After using this cream with my regular lotion my skin has never felt so smooth nor has it been so well moisturized.  The fragrance smells so good but is not overpowering which is also a plus for my sensitive skin.  Unfortunately for me all of the major stores near me were either out of stock or did not carry the product including the place I originally bought it from.  (I guess they were trying the product out at that store)  So glad they are selling this online and the price I paid is around the same price I would pay in stores.  I received my package earlier than estimated which is always good.  So happy I finally found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands/feet overly greasy but does leave them smooth, hydrated and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the best buy I have ever made.  It makes your skin so soft without being greasy.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.  My daughter uses it on her tummy and she is 8 months pregnant and hasn&#x27;t gotten a stretch mark.</li>
