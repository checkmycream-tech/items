            <li>And it barely stays on for more than five minutes.</li>

            <li> It actually makes my lips look worse than they do without it :/&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice red color. Matched very well with Vasanti USA The Ultimate Matte Red Lipstick</li>
            <li> This is a great cheap alternative to MAC&#x27;s beet lip liner - good quality and price can&#x27;t be &amp;#34;beet&amp;#34; - ha!</li>
            <li> crappy quality. The color is quite a bright red. And it barely stays on for more than five minutes. Yeah forget about eating or drinking, let alone smiling :)</li>
            <li> Like the red it is a very pretty color and I have nothing to complain about it . Good job.:)</li>
            <li> I bought this liner to wear with my ruby woo lipsticks &amp; pretty much all of my matte red lipsticks! It&#x27;s inexpensive and a great buy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip liner for my mac s ruby woo but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, and found this one. The colour matches perfectly to what is shown in the pictures and glides on smoothly. It is exactly what I was looking for !</li>
            <li> Goes perfect with MACs Ruby Woo lip color. Love it! Price was amazing and shipped quickly. In all, extremely pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> my everyday lip liner very red its a good shade last for a long time</li>
            <li> Love their lip liners.</li>
            <li> I would love it it if was darker red, i ordered it darker</li>
            <li> I got this to use with NYX Eden Lipstick. It&#x27;s a good lip liner. It matches my red lipstick really well. It is a little dry, but it stays on for a long time. It stays on longer than my lipstick. I recommend coloring in your whole lip with this liner before applying lipstick if you are using it with NYX lipstick.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there for a lot more, this one&#x27;s pretty great for the price. It doesn&#x27;t leave any crumbs lol &amp; it matches great with my matte lipstick (Red Lizard by NARS)</li>
            <li> This liner bleeds.  It actually makes my lips look worse than they do without it :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin so this may not be an issue for everyone but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a while (over a week) but it was received within the time frame that was quoted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with NYX cosmetics, but I am very picky about my red lipsticks.  I must admit that I was bit hesitant about buying this because I have been using MAC red liners and MAC red matte lipsticks as my only red lipstick products. I purchased this after mine ran out and MAC was out of the red online. I am so excited that MAC was out, because this liner is just as good if not better.  It glides on, and stays on.  It keeps my red lipstick in place and doesn&#x27;t bleed.  It&#x27;s every bit as good as expensive liners, and yet again I am pleasantly surprised by NYX.  They definitely have a customer for life in this lipstick loving girl.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this brand. But I think my previous brands are much better than this brand. But it&#x27;s still ok</li>
            <li> This is a very red, true to the picture color. The quality of Nyx cosmetics are always outstanding and this is no exception. The only disappointing feature is it is a bit shorter than it looks in the picture, so you technically don&#x27;t get as much as you&#x27;d think. Just measure out the length so you have an accurate idea in your head before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this lip liner the right shade you can wear with lipstick or lipgloss. Its soft on your lips goes on smooth</li>
            <li> This is a good quality item, much less expensive than buying at any counter and it does the job well. Goes well with any red lipstick except orange red.</li>
            <li> VERY SOFT GOING ON GREAT COLOR WILL BUY MORE OF THEM</li>
            <li> Couldnt afford the MAC liner for my Ruby Woo color lipstick from MAC so went with this.  Works great.  It is very important to use liner when having red lips</li>
