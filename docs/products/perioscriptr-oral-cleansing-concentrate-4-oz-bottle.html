            <li>Wonderful, healing concetrate that is entirely free of additives.  </li>
            <li>Very good tasting and great clean feeling</li>
            <li>I use this solution in my oral irrigator and love it!  </li>
            <li>I add two pumps of the liquid with warm water in the Waterpik after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having my own Dental Hygienist.</li>
            <li>i think and my gums look nice to boot.</li>
            <li>I feel safe when I have got this to use</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but this one is better.</li>
            <li>I have been using it every day for 8 months with the Waterpik and my dental hygienist reported at my last cleaning that my periodontal gum pockets and inflammation have been greatly reduced!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was sure I had the start of &amp;#34;Something&amp;#34;, pains and all.</li>
            <li>Much better than any toothpaste .  . .</li>
            <li>I have been battling gum disease most of my life and using this product has made a huge difference.</li>

            <li>The ingredients are far superior</li>
            <li>Leaves my gums and teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using chemichals to clean your mouth try this product when you use your water pick</li>
            <li>Frankly, I think Listerine would be just as good unless someone can tell me different.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves kind of a slime in the water container you need to rinse out frequently.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is fresh.  </li>
            <li>Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>taste is pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to canker sores, and I found that putting a squirt on top of toothpaste prior to brushing helps prevent canker sores.</li>
            <li>It would be interesting to see if others have noticed the same.</li>
            <li>Does a good job with the water pik one of the few additives made for a waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Really tackles persistent infection after getting my teeth pulled.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just so-so.</li>
            <li>It makes my whole mouth feel clean, I can&#x27;t wait to see what my Dentist has to say my next visit.</li>
            <li>The taste is decent as well, mintish but in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li>This mouth wash has been very effective in cleaning and neutralizing bad bacteria in my mouth while maintaining the good culture of active digestive enzymes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone that has even the slightest amount of gum disease problems.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it to us to pay the extra.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than just plain water.</li>
            <li>Overall very decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally natural, has an immediate healing affect on my gums.</li>
            <li>The pockets around my teeth have shrunk considerably since using this.</li>
            <li>After using it for two weeks I was back to normal.</li>
            <li>it really leaves your mouth clean and fresh and remove those small particles that are hard to remove by just brushing or flossing</li>

    <ol>
            <li> used didn&#x27;t notice any difference than using listeine</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist and is the best at killing all germs in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;The taste is pretty well it doesn&#x27;t bothers at all&lt;br /&gt;Feels fantastic</li>
            <li> A struggle to get the pump to move up, but eventually it did if you push and pull very hard.  Not sure what this stuff does but my water pic type device recommended them so I am using. Frankly, I think Listerine would be just as good unless someone can tell me different.  It also leaves kind of a slime in the water container you need to rinse out frequently.</li>
            <li> Excellent  Really tackles persistent infection after getting my teeth pulled.  I feel safe when I have got this to use</li>
            <li> I love this product. Use it with my WaterPick and could not do without it from now on. YOU SPOILED ME....</li>
            <li> Wonderful, healing concetrate that is entirely free of additives.  I use it in my Water Pik and would not be without it!</li>
            <li> This mouth wash has been very effective in cleaning and neutralizing bad bacteria in my mouth while maintaining the good culture of active digestive enzymes.</li>
            <li> We used this, then opted for the less expensive copy, and now we are back to using this.  The ingredients are far superior and it&#x27;s worth it to us to pay the extra.  We like how it feels and do believe is it helping our oral hygiene. Check the ingredients and compare...you may arrive at the same conclusion.</li>
            <li> I use this solution in my oral irrigator and love it!  Leaves my gums and teeth feeling clean.  Flavor is fresh.  I have tried one other brand like it but this one is better.</li>
            <li> Very good tasting and great clean feeling</li>
            <li> I use it regularly with my water pick. It&#x27;s totally natural, has an immediate healing affect on my gums. Too bad, it&#x27;s not more well known and therefore hard to get (except through Amazon). Every dentist office should advocate for PerioScript! A bottle lasts a very long time, since you only use a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to canker sores, and I found that putting a squirt on top of toothpaste prior to brushing helps prevent canker sores. It would be interesting to see if others have noticed the same.</li>
            <li> The pockets around my teeth have shrunk considerably since using this.</li>
            <li> I have been battling gum disease most of my life and using this product has made a huge difference. I have been using it every day for 8 months with the Waterpik and my dental hygienist reported at my last cleaning that my periodontal gum pockets and inflammation have been greatly reduced! I no longer experience bleeding of the gums or soreness in the mouth. I add two pumps of the liquid with warm water in the Waterpik after brushing and flossing. I have already purchased the second bottle and will continue to purchase as it has saved me from dental surgery.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Instead of using chemichals to clean your mouth try this product when you use your water pick it really leaves your mouth clean and fresh and remove those small particles that are hard to remove by just brushing or flossing</li>
            <li> I just bought the Hydro Floss and combine PerioScript with it daily. As I stated in my review of the Hydro Floss; I might have saved myself from a painful visit to the dentist. I was sure I had the start of &amp;#34;Something&amp;#34;, pains and all. Once I started using the Hydro Floss along with the PerioScript, the pain subsided and then disappeared in one- two days. It&#x27;s like having my own Dental Hygienist.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> I use this because my Dentist says it will help my gums and keep them from receding It seems to be doing the job</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the product. I only missed it when I ran out and started to have some gum problems again. It helps to reduce the pain and promote healing. After using it for two weeks I was back to normal. A small amount goes a long way. I highly recommend it for anyone that has even the slightest amount of gum disease problems.</li>
            <li> great product, but expensive - buy it for HALF as much at Vitacost!</li>
            <li> It makes my whole mouth feel clean, I can&#x27;t wait to see what my Dentist has to say my next visit.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my bio dentist to kill microbes in mouth. Put in water pik. My teeth had quite a bit of sensitivity. Since using this in water pik for 4 months my sensitivity is gone.  When I go back to dentist in few months and get a swab I will find out about microbes.</li>
            <li> Its syrupy looking in the bottle and i use it in my water flosser... one pump is all thats needed for me. I use it before i brush my teeth and sometimes after. It makes my mouth feel clean without feeling dry. The taste is decent as well, mintish but in no way overpowering. Overall very decent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks i think and my gums look nice to boot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just so-so. Plain water in the Waterpik water flosser works just as well if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when my package came. The item is concentrated and the dispensing pump didn&#x27;t come in the package. Not good.</li>
            <li> Much better than any toothpaste .  . .</li>
            <li> Does a good job with the water pik one of the few additives made for a waterpik.  I like it better than just plain water.</li>
