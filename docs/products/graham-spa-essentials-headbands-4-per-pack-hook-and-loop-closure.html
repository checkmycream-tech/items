            <li>Great product üëç üëç üëç üëç</li>

            <li>Good price though.</li>
            <li>But still good.</li>
            <li>It works great and easy to use and take off to massage the head.</li>
            <li>Perfect conditions, fast delivery, 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li>My own fault for not understanding the ad better.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of having a velcro headband for my state board practical test however</li>
            <li>I used one this evening, and it was snug and fit nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great quality Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They are nicely fitted and clean up well in the washer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It slides off very quickly.</li>
            <li>The velcro gets stuck to easily to the material causing thread to pull.  </li>
            <li>They are easy Velcro bands and keep hair away from my face when doing facials.</li>
            <li>but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Super smail!</li>
            <li>This product is extremely cheap...</li>
            <li>, the headband material is so cheap that the velcro will damage the fabric even though it did not touch the fabric.</li>
            <li>They ate only good for one use and then you have to toss them because they fray too easily.</li>
            <li>Full fills my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>They are useful in my skin care class.</li>
            <li>And when I hand washed them they pretty much fall apart, and snag easily.</li>
            <li>I was worried that they weren&#x27;t going to be tight enough, but there perfect.</li>
            <li>Its definitely not something used for a spa, more for running.</li>
            <li>The velcro is pretty shot after one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive but save your money for something else.</li>
            <li>Quality of the bands are not the greatest and customers have found them uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I love using these when I perform a facial.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>super tight, cant wear for more than 2 minutes and thats a bit much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>That pleases me as much as the product does.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipment!!!I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The velcro grabs the client&#x27;s hair which is very embarassing, and it also damages the elastic band as well...</li>
            <li>These headbands are more narrow than what I am used to</li>
            <li>For the price a good purchase the band is thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li>My sister has a pretty tiny head</li>
            <li>, i thought they were soft spa headbands.</li>
            <li>I am a skin care professional and I will not use these again.</li>
            <li>and I could not secure the headband comfortably for her.</li>
            <li>these work very well for facial guests.  </li>
            <li>But when I first opened them and tried them on they were pretty tight on my head!</li>
            <li>Used on two of my clients for facials and the headband just slipped right off because they were way too tight.</li>
            <li>you can barely use them once.</li>
            <li>Want to return but not worth it for $8, shipping would probably cost as much as the item did.</li>
            <li>These are flimsy and not wide enough.</li>
            <li>In my opinion as an esthetician, I feel like these are too tight, slide back and become a real pain when giving a facial.</li>

            <li> Too tight, not designed for normal head size.</li>
            <li> Too slippery - won&#x27;t keep hair back long enough to wash face.</li>
            <li> Look at the picture - when in fact, what you get is 4 pieces at nearly a dollar each when they can be bought for much much less for the package shown in the picture, which is what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Cheap uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> They broke or over stretched.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on my head to well while washing my face it kept slipping off</li>

            <li> i bought it,i was little bit worried how it will be?but</li>
            <li> This just came in, today...and it was just ordered a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> After washing just a few times they shrink and basically crumble.</li>
            <li> These headbands are thin and do not stay in place on your head for long.  </li>
            <li> These were a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Their for small heads</li>
            <li> but of course I could just have a small head.</li>
            <li> and i have a small head.</li>
            <li> Too tight!!</li>
            <li> Clothe is thin compared to typical thick spa head band.</li>

            <li> Not good for facials.</li>
            <li> When secured around their heads it was compressing their head and a painful experience, needs to use a towel or other cloth clipped instead.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use. Thank you</li>
            <li> The Velcro sticks to the band and causes snags.  After 1 use it looks mangled, especially after washing.</li>
            <li> I did not like this item, i thought they were soft spa headbands. These headbands were just some stretchy fabric with a piece of velcro on them. Its definitely not something used for a spa, more for running.</li>
            <li> The product was just what i needed. Perfect conditions, fast delivery, 100% satisfaction. I&#x27;ll Keep buying from this seller. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and I use these to pull the hair out of the way to do face massages and face treatments. It works great and easy to use and take off to massage the head.</li>
            <li> For the price a good purchase the band is thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely cheap... I love the idea of having a velcro headband for my state board practical test however, the headband material is so cheap that the velcro will damage the fabric even though it did not touch the fabric. You get what you pay for... Not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> This just came in, today...and it was just ordered a few days ago.  That pleases me as much as the product does.  I used one this evening, and it was snug and fit nicely.  I&#x27;m happy with the quality of this merchandise,and it&#x27;s ease of use.</li>
            <li> In my opinion as an esthetician, I feel like these are too tight, slide back and become a real pain when giving a facial. And when I hand washed them they pretty much fall apart, and snag easily.</li>
            <li> Great quality Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Use the head bands during exercise testing.  One per customer.  Full fills my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use on head band multiple times, look somewhere else.  The velcro is pretty shot after one use.</li>
            <li> They slip a lot but they work well for what I need them for. Which is just to keep my face washes and masks out of my hair</li>
            <li> Uhh don&#x27;t stays strap enough</li>
            <li> Look at the picture - when in fact, what you get is 4 pieces at nearly a dollar each when they can be bought for much much less for the package shown in the picture, which is what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Everytime I used these....I was unimpressed.  They broke or over stretched. I had to improvise. I am a skin care professional and I will not use these again.</li>
            <li> Super smail! My sister has a pretty tiny head and I could not secure the headband comfortably for her. Too tight!!</li>
            <li> Too tight, not designed for normal head size. I tried to stretch one out for over a week for a regular facial client, didn&#x27;t help at all. These were a waste of money! Used on two of my clients for facials and the headband just slipped right off because they were way too tight. When secured around their heads it was compressing their head and a painful experience, needs to use a towel or other cloth clipped instead. Want to return but not worth it for $8, shipping would probably cost as much as the item did.</li>
            <li> The elastic band does not allow for it to stay on your head. It slides off very quickly. It&#x27;s not expensive but save your money for something else.</li>
            <li> Their for small heads</li>
            <li> Not that great quality, can not be washed without Velcro snagging the rest of the headband. Disposable after one use.</li>
            <li> They are a one time use type of product.</li>
            <li> Was slightly disappointed by these.. I initially order a two pack was charged for both and only received one. Quality of the bands are not the greatest and customers have found them uncomfortable. Clothe is thin compared to typical thick spa head band.</li>
            <li> I find these headbands to be a little tight and restrictive.</li>
            <li> i bought it,i was little bit worried how it will be?but it turn out to be too good.it was delivered on time.quality is good.</li>
            <li> I love using these when I perform a facial. They are nicely fitted and clean up well in the washer.</li>
            <li> The velcro gets stuck to easily to the material causing thread to pull.  Serves the purpose for one maybe two time use.</li>
            <li> These headbands are awesome!! I was worried that they weren&#x27;t going to be tight enough, but there perfect. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!!!I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use. Good for keeping hair out of the way when washing face or giving facials.</li>
            <li> Very thin.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on my head to well while washing my face it kept slipping off but of course I could just have a small head. The quality of the material was really really good though</li>
            <li> My own fault for not understanding the ad better. What&#x27;s pictured is a larger bag of headbands which lead me to understand that the &amp;#34;4pack&amp;#34; was 4 packs of headbands. But it&#x27;s actually 4 headbands. Not worth $6 for disposable headbands in my opinion. I returned them.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  They are just like the ones that the associates use at the spa</li>
            <li> Not for use in a spa or high-volume setting. After washing just a few times they shrink and basically crumble.</li>
            <li> Good price though. They are useful in my skin care class. But when I first opened them and tried them on they were pretty tight on my head! So I had to stretch them out a bit. But still good. Also if the velcro part sticks to the band it kinda messes up the fabric that&#x27;s why I rated it a 3.</li>
            <li> These do the trick! They are easy Velcro bands and keep hair away from my face when doing facials.</li>
            <li> These are flimsy and not wide enough. They ate only good for one use and then you have to toss them because they fray too easily. Not good for facials.</li>
            <li> Too slippery - won&#x27;t keep hair back long enough to wash face.</li>
            <li> I like this product!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfect. thanks</li>
            <li> These headbands are more narrow than what I am used to but it does the job just fine. The Velcro holds the clients hair very nicely. The price is great.</li>
            <li> super tight, cant wear for more than 2 minutes and thats a bit much. Cheap uncomfortable....and i have a small head.</li>
            <li> I would give it - 5 stars is I could! you can barely use them once. The velcro grabs the client&#x27;s hair which is very embarassing, and it also damages the elastic band as well...I will never order or use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product üëç üëç üëç üëç</li>
            <li> these work very well for facial guests.  they stretch enough to accommodate every head shape</li>
            <li> These headbands are thin and do not stay in place on your head for long.  I would not buy again.</li>
