    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best acne cleanser I have found.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>It has done a great job of clearing my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>My sister and dad have already bought their own bottles after seeing what great results I&#x27;ve been having!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and it is easily the best cleanser i have ever used for my oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>When I use this cleanser with the toner and moisturizer, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li>Works as good as the Brand they sell on TV for a lot lower price .</li>
            <li>It works AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>, I guess for exfoliating, that makes it kind of a scrub.</li>
            <li>It has also been effective, and has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really can depend on AcneFree Acne Cleanser because I have tried others, including Proactiv, and this is the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have found that if I use this product just once five days before sun exposure, I will get sunburned very easily.</li>
            <li>I used to use Neutrogena oil free face wash, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Also, it has close to zero odor at all, which should be a very welcome surprise to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s smell is more like grease than as a beauty product.</li>
            <li>Even though I have read that for skin with acne we shouldn&#x27;t use scrub type products, this one seems ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Benzoyl peroxide has anti-microbial properties and is helpful for combating the bacteria involved in most acne.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure glad he did.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find it available on line.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever found a  better product for my skin.</li>
            <li>The entire system (day cream and night cream) is superb.</li>
            <li>My husband is a physician and likes this better than the TV brand .</li>
            <li>It is gentle, yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>, what is more important for you?</li>
            <li>I have used this produce for over a year and it works well and is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>with severe acne may need other agents, but this product is a good start and should form foundation of good skin care in dealing with acne.</li>
            <li>And the size....its huge.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the feel of my skin and in the moisture retension of my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to buy from the manufacturer website, but amazon sell it cheaper with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Acne Free has some \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in it</li>
            <li>is what sets this Acne Free apart.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I tried countless cleansers/systems for probably 6 years until I found this, and then I have been using AcneFree happily for 3</li>
            <li>This is a great product for mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for her and us! :-)</li>
            <li>Virtually all the available readily available benzoyl peroxide cleansers have a higher concentration of benzoyl peroxide (5-10%).</li>
            <li>after finding this product i have to say i am a true believer that this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product but it was sold out in all local stores for over a month.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be scarred and bumpy due to acne and after using this I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I used to use a perscription-only product called Desquam, but insurance companies are getting more and more picky about covering products that are too similar to over-the-counter alternatives.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job with acne and adult acne</li>
            <li>it will leave your skin feeling fresh and super clean.</li>
            <li>Got very fast!</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the results combining this face wash with the foaming benzoyl peroxide and foaming salicylic acid products of the same brand.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re new to acne treatments, i would give this a try before spending a lot more money on proactiv, which i found to be too drying.</li>
            <li>He ordered a nice big package and his shiny little dome is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years but the new formula doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>Amazon, oh Amazon, why do you rarely ever have this in stock?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost EVERYTHING including prescription acne medications, but none cleared up my skin as nicely as I wanted without side effects (peeling skin, red, eventually stops working.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, though.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it separately from the kit now because I only use this product with the acne free lotion.</li>
            <li>this is exciting for me because i&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin for years.</li>
            <li>I will stick with more natural products.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t over dry like Clearasil and other \\&quot;pimple</li>
            <li>And I have used both, I think that has to do with the active ingredient, which Acne Free has more at the cost of heavier smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have tried many different acne products over the years, ever since i was a teenager battling it.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer of Acne Free Acne Cleanser for approximately three years now and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I now have clear skin and have had clear skin for many years because of AcneFree.</li>
            <li>This stuff washes gently, and rinses well.  </li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than ProActiv.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with mild dryness and small dots around my face with occassional larger pimples.</li>
            <li>only problem is that now that I am very active, the cleanser has too many chemical exfoliates and my face sunburns way too easily when I use this.</li>
            <li>The 2.5 % benzoyl peroxide active ingredient is what makes this such a good product.</li>
            <li>Only face soap I use and the price is right!</li>
            <li>AcneFree Acne Cleanser is pretty much the only brand of acne cleanser that has worked on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>The main thing is the 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide in it.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I not been breaking out, but the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my face are completely gone and my skin is smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Now we&#x27;ve got enough to last a good long while.</li>
            <li>We recommend this to anyone who wants to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>I originally started out using the 3 step system in sensitive, because my skin gets very dry when using benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>The higher concentrations are NOT more efficacious and simply cause more skin drying and</li>
            <li>It works better then most expensive facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied with this facial wash and will continue to use it, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that every acne product clearly states that you should limit sun exposure while using the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old and have struggled with acne for years.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are over 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>The micronized ingredients really get deep into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have given one bottle to my 13 year old grandson to help him with his developing acne.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleanser for the past 3 years and it keeps my skin clear and pimple free.  </li>
            <li>AcneFree doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin nearly as much, and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I count on this cleanser to keep acne away, yet not dry my mature skin.</li>
            <li>University Medical, why do you insist on selling the whole system that comes with a much smaller bottle?</li>
            <li>BRING back the old formula!</li>
            <li>It has a few scruby, gritty pieces for exfoliating, but it&#x27;s still a pretty gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>The only face wash I&#x27;ve found that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li>Back is clear, face has stopped getting sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked decently but I noticed that my skin still got very dry using it.</li>
            <li>I developed acne later in life and after trying every product, this is the only thing that worked.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give you immediate results but after a few weeks of daily use you really see the difference!</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely had any break outs, plus this doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li> for me it actually works to reduce oil production, so my skin is not nearly as oily as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This order will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Within a few days we had a miracle, a completely clear head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;only a drop of this cleanser is needed, so one bottle lasts a very long time if you&#x27;re using it just on your face.</li>
            <li> this cleanser controls my blackhead problem and doesn&#x27;t make my skin over dry or oily.</li>
            <li> if you skip a period of time not washing your face with it, you&#x27;re liable to get some breakouts as i&#x27;ve noticed for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv off and on for several years and it made my skin dry, as I&#x27;ve heard is common.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it is quite hard to find in local pharmacies and stores now.&lt;br /&gt;Individuals</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used Proactive and spent hundreds of dollars and a friend of mine who unfortunately has much worse acne talked us into using Acne Free.</li>
            <li> i was also hesitant with the exfoliating beads in the wash due to my sensitive skin but thankfully, they haven&#x27;t been harsh or irritating at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two weeks now</li>
            <li> Prescription products are too harsh and brand name products don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I wasted time and money</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find now due to temporary manufacturing issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my son and he&#x27;s been using this product for a few years now and his acne is gone!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife from Amazon.com because they didn&#x27;t have it in Amazon.ca and the Walmart store where we used to buy it is no longer stocking the item (possibly due to poor demand).  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find facial wash with a small percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide (less than 5 percent).  </li>
            <li> Waste of money for me because I had the worst dry skin and breakouts after just using this product once!</li>
            <li> for a period of time i even went with prescription meds from a dermatologist but that got to be too expensive after awhile.  </li>
            <li> The medication made him to sick to care.</li>

            <li> as tittle. this cleanser controls my blackhead problem and doesn&#x27;t make my skin over dry or oily. I used to buy from the manufacturer website, but amazon sell it cheaper with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s ingridients have changed since last order.  The product has caused me to have break out again. I have stopped using it. The product&#x27;s smell is more like grease than as a beauty product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years. It has done a great job of clearing my skin. I used to use Neutrogena oil free face wash, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good. Acne Free has some \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in it, I guess for exfoliating, that makes it kind of a scrub. Even though I have read that for skin with acne we shouldn&#x27;t use scrub type products, this one seems ok. When I use this cleanser with the toner and moisturizer, my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for the past 3 years and it keeps my skin clear and pimple free.  Getting 3 at once lasts me for a year. Can&#x27;t beat that for the price.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years but the new formula doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the old one. BRING back the old formula!</li>
            <li> The 2.5 % benzoyl peroxide active ingredient is what makes this such a good product. Benzoyl peroxide has anti-microbial properties and is helpful for combating the bacteria involved in most acne.  Virtually all the available readily available benzoyl peroxide cleansers have a higher concentration of benzoyl peroxide (5-10%). The higher concentrations are NOT more efficacious and simply cause more skin drying and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This is what sets this Acne Free apart.  It is gentle, yet very effective.  As others have noted, it is quite hard to find in local pharmacies and stores now.&lt;br /&gt;Individuals with severe acne may need other agents, but this product is a good start and should form foundation of good skin care in dealing with acne.</li>
            <li> It works better then most expensive facial cleansers. My daughter and I used Proactive and spent hundreds of dollars and a friend of mine who unfortunately has much worse acne talked us into using Acne Free. It worked really well for her and us! :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product and for an excellent price. And the size....its huge. This order will last me a very long time. If you&#x27;ve used this product and you like the way it works....this is the only way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is very difficult to find facial wash with a small percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide (less than 5 percent).  I used to use a perscription-only product called Desquam, but insurance companies are getting more and more picky about covering products that are too similar to over-the-counter alternatives.  This stuff washes gently, and rinses well.  It has also been effective, and has not irritated my skin.  If you are looking around, you should definitely give this product a try.  Also, it has close to zero odor at all, which should be a very welcome surprise to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only face wash I&#x27;ve found that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great. I have used Proactiv off and on for several years and it made my skin dry, as I&#x27;ve heard is common. AcneFree doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin nearly as much, and I use it twice a day. I could only use Proactiv once a day because of the dryness and flaking. It has a few scruby, gritty pieces for exfoliating, but it&#x27;s still a pretty gentle cleanser. I use it in the shower in the morning and in the evening. I think a key is to let it sit on your face for a minute before you rinse.</li>
            <li> I purchased 6 bottles on June 2014. Received them all with expiry date December 2014! Am I going to use six bottles in six months?&lt;br /&gt;The six bottles are almost to expire! One&#x27;s must investigate about the expiry date before purchase.</li>
            <li> Although I can now find this in the retail stores again, when I purchased it from Amazon it was not in the stores anymore. I count on this cleanser to keep acne away, yet not dry my mature skin. I really can depend on AcneFree Acne Cleanser because I have tried others, including Proactiv, and this is the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my son and he&#x27;s been using this product for a few years now and his acne is gone! I wouldn&#x27;t lie! Don&#x27;t know how he discovered this product but I&#x27;m sure glad he did.</li>
            <li> Only face soap I use and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Amazon, oh Amazon, why do you rarely ever have this in stock?  University Medical, why do you insist on selling the whole system that comes with a much smaller bottle? This product is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t over dry like Clearasil and other \\&quot;pimple free\\&quot; face wash ilk. i.e. it lives up to its promise. But I can never get it at a reasonble price or size, so I&#x27;ve had to forgo it for now and settle for the drug store brand that turns my face into sandpaper.</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than ProActiv.  Although it doesn&#x27;t have enough scrubbing &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in it, I use it with a scrub sponge and get enough exfoliation that way.  The main thing is the 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide in it.  Keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> i have tried many different acne products over the years, ever since i was a teenager battling it.  these include all the big names that you can find at your local b&amp;m stores.  for a period of time i even went with prescription meds from a dermatologist but that got to be too expensive after awhile.  after finding this product i have to say i am a true believer that this stuff works.  it doesn&#x27;t give you immediate results but after a few weeks of daily use you really see the difference! i don&#x27;t think any product has ever worked this well, prescription or non-prescription.  i do have to say tho that once you start using it, you do have to continue to use it.  if you skip a period of time not washing your face with it, you&#x27;re liable to get some breakouts as i&#x27;ve noticed for myself.  i was also hesitant with the exfoliating beads in the wash due to my sensitive skin but thankfully, they haven&#x27;t been harsh or irritating at all.  i&#x27;m very satisfied with this facial wash and will continue to use it, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but it was sold out in all local stores for over a month. Was thrilled to find it available on line. Now we&#x27;ve got enough to last a good long while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two boxes of this and I really like this cleanser. It really does a good job with acne and adult acne</li>
            <li> Got very fast! Will order again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m 22 years old and have struggled with acne for years. I&#x27;ve tried almost EVERYTHING including prescription acne medications, but none cleared up my skin as nicely as I wanted without side effects (peeling skin, red, eventually stops working.) that&#x27;s until I found out about acnefree. I originally started out using the 3 step system in sensitive, because my skin gets very dry when using benzoyl peroxide. It worked decently but I noticed that my skin still got very dry using it. I ran out of the cleanser and saw this one at the store and grabbed it. It works AMAZINGLY. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two weeks now and I&#x27;ve barely had any break outs, plus this doesn&#x27;t dry out my face! My skin used to be scarred and bumpy due to acne and after using this I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments on how great my skin looks. Not only have I not been breaking out, but the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my face are completely gone and my skin is smooth and even. I haven&#x27;t even been using the toner or lotion that came with the three step system because this one works so well on its on. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. My sister and dad have already bought their own bottles after seeing what great results I&#x27;ve been having!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for mild to moderate acne. I haven&#x27;t ever found a  better product for my skin. Prescription products are too harsh and brand name products don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a shame we have to get it shipped to Canada now as its only sold in the US. It&#x27;s worth the money, though.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle, yet effective. I love that I can buy it separately from the kit now because I only use this product with the acne free lotion.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and it is easily the best cleanser i have ever used for my oily, acne prone skin. for me it actually works to reduce oil production, so my skin is not nearly as oily as it used to be. this is exciting for me because i&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin for years. now i can wear makeup without it sliding off my face!&lt;br /&gt;only a drop of this cleanser is needed, so one bottle lasts a very long time if you&#x27;re using it just on your face. it will leave your skin feeling fresh and super clean. if you&#x27;re new to acne treatments, i would give this a try before spending a lot more money on proactiv, which i found to be too drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife from Amazon.com because they didn&#x27;t have it in Amazon.ca and the Walmart store where we used to buy it is no longer stocking the item (possibly due to poor demand).  This product is &amp;#34;cream of the crop&amp;#34; when it comes to acne medication because my wife says it cleared her skin in just a couple of days of using the product and her complexion has never been clearer.  We recommend this to anyone who wants to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are over 60 years old.  He wears a hat all the time when he is outside.  His head started breaking out and the Doctor gave him medication for it.  The medication made him to sick to care. I saw a package of this on the discount rack at the Grocery store so decided &amp;#34;It can&#x27;t hurt and might help&amp;#34;. Took it home, made him start that day.  Within a few days we had a miracle, a completely clear head.  He ordered a nice big package and his shiny little dome is beautiful.  TYVM:0)</li>
            <li> This is the best acne cleanser I have found. The entire system (day cream and night cream) is superb. I tried countless cleansers/systems for probably 6 years until I found this, and then I have been using AcneFree happily for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that now that I am very active, the cleanser has too many chemical exfoliates and my face sunburns way too easily when I use this. I even stopped using this the morning before I would spend time outside, and I would still get sunburned with sunscreen on, after 60 minutes. I have found that if I use this product just once five days before sun exposure, I will get sunburned very easily. I now use this only on my back for athlete&#x27;s bacne. Back is clear, face has stopped getting sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that every acne product clearly states that you should limit sun exposure while using the product. I just never had to worry about this until I started spending a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me because I had the worst dry skin and breakouts after just using this product once! I cannot condone anyone using this product because of the severe reaction I received. I wasted time and money and I fully regret it. I will stick with more natural products. I have fair skin with mild dryness and small dots around my face with occassional larger pimples. Since I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Willowbark face wash I have noticed a huge difference in the feel of my skin and in the moisture retension of my skin.</li>
            <li> After trying several acne therapies on the market, my daughter and I decided to try this brand.  The micronized ingredients really get deep into the skin.  We are very pleased with the results combining this face wash with the foaming benzoyl peroxide and foaming salicylic acid products of the same brand. Would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find now due to temporary manufacturing issues.  The 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have used this produce for over a year and it works well and is easy on the skin. I have given one bottle to my 13 year old grandson to help him with his developing acne.</li>
            <li> And I have used both, I think that has to do with the active ingredient, which Acne Free has more at the cost of heavier smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what is more important for you?</li>
            <li> Works as good as the Brand they sell on TV for a lot lower price . My husband is a physician and likes this better than the TV brand .</li>
            <li> I developed acne later in life and after trying every product, this is the only thing that worked. I now have clear skin and have had clear skin for many years because of AcneFree.</li>
            <li> AcneFree Acne Cleanser is pretty much the only brand of acne cleanser that has worked on a consistent basis. I have been a loyal customer of Acne Free Acne Cleanser for approximately three years now and my skin has never looked better!</li>
