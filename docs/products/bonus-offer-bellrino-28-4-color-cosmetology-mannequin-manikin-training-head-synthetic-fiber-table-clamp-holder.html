            <li>MY GRANDAUGHTER IS TAKING A COSMOTOLOGY COURSE IN HIGH SCHOOL.  </li>
            <li>It was heat resistant, it was soft, and seemed like really hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is lifelike on this mannequin head and facial features are some what life life with rubber skin.</li>
            <li>AND YOU CAN BET THAT I WILL BACK AGAIN THANKS!</li>
            <li>The hair feels so natural.</li>

            <li>My niece has very long, wavy, natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Good head for the price, although the hair is obviously fake and gives little experience for those who want to work on human hair.</li>

            <li> The hair is lifelike on this mannequin head and facial features are some what life life with rubber skin. The head is smaller than what you would expect from an adult which is a little odd given it is a Cosmetology practice mannequin,</li>

            <li> Was given as a gift, but she really liked it.</li>
            <li> The hair feels so natural. I want to teach people how to braid. The only difficulty for that is, it&#x27;s cut in a blunt V. For braiding, a straight cut would have been better, but it&#x27;s still great to have.</li>
            <li> It came in a box but her hair wasent that long when I got it I checked before anything done</li>

            <li> Ive experienced A LOT of shedding! So if purchasing this product..expect that. It also has alopecia as well, which makes it hard to style certain ways</li>
            <li> I bought this item to practice braids and updos (I only received this item 3 days ago) and the hair falls out INSTANTLY. The head is already bald in places! I do NOT recommend spending money on this head!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was real hair,  When you buy this type of Mannequin with synthetic hair, it falls out and hard to style</li>

            <li> My niece has very long, wavy, natural hair.  I bought this one for her so she can practice ways to style her hair when it is flat-ironed.  She was so happy to receive this for Christmas.  She loves it.  I think it is great.  The hair is long and silky.  She has twisted it, braided it, and put it in buns and ponytails.  She asked what would happen if she washed it and I told her I didn&#x27;t know.  I will update review after she washes it and let you all know.</li>
            <li> Good ítems hope to deal with you in the future</li>
