            <li>This is one of the best foundations I have found.</li>
            <li>best part is it dries like within 10 minutes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a perfect application every time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done research before purchasing a self tanning lotion to see what one is the best.</li>
            <li>This was rated the best on the market.</li>
            <li>It works perfect.  </li>
            <li>Adonia is one of the best.</li>
            <li>If you can have someone spray it on for you while you turn, I think that would work best.</li>
            <li>color is a beautiful bronze, just like the product says.  </li>
            <li>and I used that with great results.</li>
            <li>I used the serum on my face and it was great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so you&lt;br /&gt;can look great, not splotchy..</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate to get best results before applying.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go with clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Its really good.</li>
            <li>This product gives a great tan and I love it.</li>
            <li>If anyone else has found a better way to apply besides gloved hands please let me know !  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>About two applications gets me the nice tan I want.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the color of this bronzer</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>before dressing; to be honest, don&#x27;t have time for that.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly which is a great benefit.  </li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best self tanning product ever.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the quality of this spray tan.</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.</li>
            <li>It does not have much of a smell, which is great.   </li>
            <li>the fact that it dries fast is great, but doesn&#x27;t help in seeing where you haven&#x27;t applied it yet.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m sure you can find another sunless tanner that&#x27;s cheaper and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>and when I get up in the morning I have a lovely tan.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use the spray on your feet, be sure to use the face serum on your feet.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You may have to pump the nozzle many times to get it to start spraying.</li>
            <li>Whew, just in time! :-)</li>
            <li>the next day\\&quot; coverage.. best to start using it a week</li>
            <li>After you apply the tanner it is best to give it some time to dry before you get dressed.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>first off, it&#x27;s either extremely popular or</li>
            <li>was trying to find out from others if they experienced same thing.</li>
            <li>Great results in a short time!</li>
            <li>so I could reorder as soon as this item was available.  </li>
            <li>I planned to use this for a special event, and didnt check the directions on the bottle until the day before..</li>
            <li>, it has a nice smell and my sensitive skin (prone to breaking out)</li>
            <li>I used to think 30 seconds was good enough, but it isn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t completely mastered the feet, yet, but they still look pretty good.  </li>
            <li>No bad smells or streaks.</li>
            <li>No streaking, NO ORANGE, mild smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Spending the time and putting in the effort is worth it if you want the results.</li>
            <li>So far this is brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li>worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>This looks very natural and is easy to use.    </li>
            <li>Probably anything is going to look a little orange-ish on me, but this color is better than most.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and</li>
            <li>No tanning product is worth this much money.</li>
            <li>exfoliate/shave first.</li>
            <li>Be sure to do your neck, chest and back of neck, around your shoulders and arms for sleeveless wear.</li>
            <li>First of all, buy some gloves.</li>
            <li>Sheer coverage, and to cover any blemishes, use a dab more.</li>
            <li>Works after first application.</li>
            <li>I seen results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>than I lickity  split put it on my legs, hoping that I could put some more on the next day.</li>
            <li>Im pretty tan already</li>
            <li>The first morning I woke up after using this, I was amazed by how much it worked just after one use.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve spent more than this on other products combined but have never had the look that I have with this one.</li>
            <li>The replacement works fine, so it was simply a faulty pump or something that broke the pump in the mailing.  </li>
            <li>After spending hours researching self tanners that have little to no odor and that dont turn you orange, I took the plunge in hopes that this would be the answer to getting a nice glow for the summer.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really see where you&#x27;re applying it and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, subtle but gives you enough color to look good in anything in the summer.</li>
            <li>It definitely does have a self-tanner smell, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>A slight one, but not awful.  </li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;d rather spend a little more and have a great-looking tan.</li>
            <li>: make sure this is completely dry prior to dressing or going to bed or whatever (your skin will feel smooth when it&#x27;s dry, not sticky or tacky).     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty white,</li>
            <li>Over the past couple months I&#x27;ve become somewhat of an expert on this product so let me tell you how to make it your favorite.</li>
            <li>i would hope something that cost this much would take the guess work out of the application coverage because you would only buy this</li>
            <li>So, if this had some tint in it, I would have known where the heck it was going and how much it was covering, as it is, its a big giant guess..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or sheets, and washes off so gradually you barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>Tanning is something that requires a little bit of work to do it right.</li>
            <li>There probably is a slight orange tint to this, but nothing like the self tanners that first came out on the market.  </li>
            <li>, so I only needed one application, however my tan turned out pretty uneven because the spray goes on clear</li>
            <li>it was enough only for two applications, and the product is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries relatively quickly, and doesn&#x27;t even smell too bad.</li>
            <li>it is important to only do a small area at a time before moving on to other areas.</li>

            <li> Its pretty hard to spray the backs</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that dries quickly, never looks orange/looks natural, and never streaks...</li>
            <li> but sure enough I woke up the next morning with a tacky burnt orange tan that looked very fake.  </li>
            <li> Organic, the smell is not too bad, gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> With the long wait</li>
            <li> I was extra careful applying this product, exfoliated and moisturized before hand, etc...</li>
            <li> It also will not last 60 days if you use it every other day like it says to.  </li>
            <li> and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last that long, the expensive price tag just isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> 3: don&#x27;t apply in a humid room or it won&#x27;t dry well.</li>
            <li> its also not designed to be used on your face and neck, they have another product for that, so this can end up costing a small fortune for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> The tops of my feet were very dark, but my legs ended up splotchy, and not as well covered in the back.</li>
            <li> It really is not as advertised at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my face and neck but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well in those areas as Adonia&#x27;s other product.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Moral of the story, dont waste your money on this product and dont believe Adonia&#x27;s promises!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Look it up on google with their other products!</li>
            <li> so half my bottle was gone in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter, Adonia is no better than some of the other self-tanners out there, and certainly not worth the price, so I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already naturally dark,  instead of pale, you can probably get a longer usage out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was so sick of turning yellow, or the stuff stinking to high heaven, streaking, or having it rub off on your sheets and clothes.  </li>
            <li> however you must put it on with extreme caution!!  </li>
            <li> I look like I spent some serious time tanning because I&#x27;m ordinarily very pale.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on after my shower and then go to bed</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is thick, and there is not much spray inside -</li>
            <li> &quot; I mean at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> , I mean NO idea where the coverage is going when you rub it in.</li>
            <li> I imagine with a lot of practice this could be your secret tanning weapon, but beware of the \\&quot;quicky one event</li>
            <li> saw some other posts about bad service, so perhaps Adonia is paying attention and trying to improve things.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doing something wrong so</li>
            <li> But unfortunately F for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Comes out awful and way to dark!</li>
            <li> Its also VERY EXPENSIVE..</li>
            <li> has not had any bad reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I posted up a question on-line about my product leaking all over when I tried to spray it on. I thought I was doing something wrong so was trying to find out from others if they experienced same thing. Nobody who replied had the same issue. Adonia proactively looked at that post (I hadn&#x27;t asked anything of them at that point) and sent me another. The replacement works fine, so it was simply a faulty pump or something that broke the pump in the mailing.  I am fair-skinned so I don&#x27;t need a deep tan. Probably anything is going to look a little orange-ish on me, but this color is better than most. If I can make it last up to two months, I will purchase again. I like the face/neck tanner also, it has a nice smell and my sensitive skin (prone to breaking out) has not had any bad reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some other posts about bad service, so perhaps Adonia is paying attention and trying to improve things.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the quality of this spray tan. Organic, the smell is not too bad, gives you a nice glow. Unfortunately, the bottle is thick, and there is not much spray inside - it was enough only for two applications, and the product is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> first off, it&#x27;s either extremely popular or the company just doesn&#x27;t stock enough for demand.  It took about 3 weeks to get my order.  It does not have much of a smell, which is great.   A slight one, but not awful.  I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a tint so you can&#x27;t really see where you&#x27;re applying it and the fact that it dries fast is great, but doesn&#x27;t help in seeing where you haven&#x27;t applied it yet.  Definitely use gloves.   Your palms will be orange if you don&#x27;t.  There probably is a slight orange tint to this, but nothing like the self tanners that first came out on the market.  It also will not last 60 days if you use it every other day like it says to.  If you&#x27;re already naturally dark,  instead of pale, you can probably get a longer usage out of the bottle.  I&#x27;m pretty white, so half my bottle was gone in less than a week.  I stopped using it so it could last longer.  Honestly, I&#x27;m sure you can find another sunless tanner that&#x27;s cheaper and works just as well.  With the long wait and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last that long, the expensive price tag just isn&#x27;t worth it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> There website says it ships in 3 days Fed Ex. Then I find out after ordering it  that it takes 4-7 days to process the order, then it ships out.   After still not receiving it after 10days, I sent another email asking where it was.  They informed me it was on backorder?   Terrible customer service. They did not seem to care that they charged my card and  were not going to notify me it was on backorder.  Not worth the money. No tanning product is worth this much money.</li>
            <li> This product gives a great tan and I love it. It goes on smoothly, dries relatively quickly, and doesn&#x27;t even smell too bad. I usually put it on after my shower and then go to bed and when I get up in the morning I have a lovely tan. Nice! Some hints: 1: exfoliate/shave first. 2: put lotion on your knees and ankles prior to application. 3: don&#x27;t apply in a humid room or it won&#x27;t dry well. 4: make sure this is completely dry prior to dressing or going to bed or whatever (your skin will feel smooth when it&#x27;s dry, not sticky or tacky).     I did not use this on my face-- the company has a product for the face and I used that with great results. I also used the face product on my feet and the backs of my hands. I look like I spent some serious time tanning because I&#x27;m ordinarily very pale. This looks very natural and is easy to use.    The only drawback is the price. That&#x27;s the ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars! Then again, I&#x27;d rather spend a little more and have a great-looking tan. To be honest, I&#x27;ve spent more than this on other products combined but have never had the look that I have with this one. To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I have purchased yet, and believe me... I have tried them ALL.  I was so sick of turning yellow, or the stuff stinking to high heaven, streaking, or having it rub off on your sheets and clothes.  This doesn&#x27;t.  Allow about 15 minutes drying time before you get dressed.  About two applications gets me the nice tan I want.  I used the serum on my face and it was great.  Be sure to do your neck, chest and back of neck, around your shoulders and arms for sleeveless wear. I haven&#x27;t completely mastered the feet, yet, but they still look pretty good.  I wouldn&#x27;t use the spray on your feet, be sure to use the face serum on your feet. It is terrific, you will not regret getting this product.  It is pricey, but I figured all the other money I have wasted on tanning products in the past, is far more than I spent on this. Love it.</li>
            <li> This can be the best tanner around if you use it correctly. Over the past couple months I&#x27;ve become somewhat of an expert on this product so let me tell you how to make it your favorite. First of all, buy some gloves. You can get a box of gloves for almost nothing at a local pharmacy.  Second, since there is almost no color to the liquid it is important to only do a small area at a time before moving on to other areas. This way you don&#x27;t have to second guess where you put it and where you didn&#x27;t. After you apply the tanner it is best to give it some time to dry before you get dressed. By \\&quot;some time\\&quot; I mean at least 5 minutes. I used to think 30 seconds was good enough, but it isn&#x27;t.    I have used this on my face and neck but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well in those areas as Adonia&#x27;s other product. I&#x27;ve learned to use the two together for best results.    Tanning is something that requires a little bit of work to do it right. Spending the time and putting in the effort is worth it if you want the results. So far this is brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!! Did not get what&#x27;s in the picture, which is what I wanted! They sent a can of spray tan. Comes out awful and way to dark!</li>
            <li> It really is not as advertised at all. As others have said, there&#x27;s no way a bottle would last 60 days; 30 days would be stretching it. It definitely does have a self-tanner smell, it&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s there. Even after showering the next morning I could still smell it on my skin. And speaking of showering, it DOES come off on your towels and sheets. I have white towels and sheets and, oh yes, it does rub off. I had no problem with the shipping but it doesn&#x27;t matter, Adonia is no better than some of the other self-tanners out there, and certainly not worth the price, so I won&#x27;t be ordering again. But if you do, don&#x27;t forget to wear gloves. No matter how well you wash your hands after applying, you will have orange palms.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foundations I have found. Sheer coverage, and to cover any blemishes, use a dab more. Very smooth application.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color of this bronzer however you must put it on with extreme caution!!  It dries super fast and yes it streaks!!  Im still trying to find a way to use it without leaving lines that you have no choice but to wait for them to fade.  Maybe I will try a sponge?  If anyone else has found a better way to apply besides gloved hands please let me know !  Again A+ for color (it is not orange Thank Goodness) But unfortunately F for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great product. No bad smells or streaks.Easy to apply. Good price. Nice packaging. Great results in a short time! Perfection</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best self tanning product ever.  I&#x27;ve tried them all -- Clinique, Lancome, Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a beautiful bronze, just like the product says.  No streaking, NO ORANGE, mild smell.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is it dries like within 10 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go with clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.  It&#x27;s just amazing how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Works after first application. Use disposable gloves when applying. You may have to pump the nozzle many times to get it to start spraying.</li>
            <li> Bronzing Glow is &amp;#34;the only way to tan&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t want to use a tanning bed or lay out.  I have used this product for years. It dries quickly which is a great benefit.  Other products I&#x27;ve tried you have to wait 30 min. before dressing; to be honest, don&#x27;t have time for that.  Just spray this stuff on, rub it in, do your hair (or wait about 5 min.), get dressed, and go.  Make sure to exfoliate to get best results before applying.  This is the only product I have found that dries quickly, never looks orange/looks natural, and never streaks...it&#x27;s a perfect application every time.  I was almost out of my stock and was checking daily so I could reorder as soon as this item was available.  Whew, just in time! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done research before purchasing a self tanning lotion to see what one is the best. This was rated the best on the market. I have to DEFINITELY agree with that. I seen results the first time I used it. I spray it on my body after I get out of shower. It dries instantly so you dont have to wait to get dressed. The first morning I woke up after using this, I was amazed by how much it worked just after one use. The directions say spray on your body then rub it in with circular motion then wash hand idmeadiatly after use. There has been one time I forgot to wash my hands, I wont do that again. It turned my hands orange. There are no orange marks on my body, no streaks, no smell. It works perfect.  I definitely recommend this product. Its safer and cheaper than going tanning.</li>
            <li> Adonia is one of the best. It gives you color without streaks.  It&#x27;s easy to use, subtle but gives you enough color to look good in anything in the summer. It doesn&#x27;t smell, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or sheets, and washes off so gradually you barely notice it.  Its really good.</li>
            <li> I planned to use this for a special event, and didnt check the directions on the bottle until the day before.. It said to use DAILY until you got the desired result.. YIKES! My event&lt;br /&gt;was the next day! So I followed directions, than I lickity  split put it on my legs, hoping that I could put some more on the next day. Im pretty tan already, so I only needed one application, however my tan turned out pretty uneven because the spray goes on clear so you have NO  idea, I mean NO idea where the coverage is going when you rub it in. The tops of my feet were very dark, but my legs ended up splotchy, and not as well covered in the back. If you can have someone spray it on for you while you turn, I think that would work best. Its pretty hard to spray the backs&lt;br /&gt;of your legs. So, if this had some tint in it, I would have known where the heck it was going and how much it was covering, as it is, its a big giant guess.. but what did get covered looked&lt;br /&gt;nice, and not too orange. I imagine with a lot of practice this could be your secret tanning weapon, but beware of the \\&quot;quicky one event the next day\\&quot; coverage.. best to start using it a week&lt;br /&gt;before I think.. Its also VERY EXPENSIVE.. i would hope something that cost this much would take the guess work out of the application coverage because you would only buy this so you&lt;br /&gt;can look great, not splotchy.. its also not designed to be used on your face and neck, they have another product for that, so this can end up costing a small fortune for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> Just awful. Don&#x27;t buy. The entire Adonia company is a scam. Look it up on google with their other products!</li>
            <li> After spending hours researching self tanners that have little to no odor and that dont turn you orange, I took the plunge in hopes that this would be the answer to getting a nice glow for the summer.  I was extra careful applying this product, exfoliated and moisturized before hand, etc...but sure enough I woke up the next morning with a tacky burnt orange tan that looked very fake.  Adonia doesnt have an offensive odor but does smell a bit like dirt.  Moral of the story, dont waste your money on this product and dont believe Adonia&#x27;s promises!</li>
