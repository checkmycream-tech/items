            <li>Great product for anyone with thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Works perfect when I&#x27;m in a rush and can&#x27;t wash my hair!</li>
            <li>This product is great for days</li>
            <li>works great.  </li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>Have a great day!  :)</li>
            <li>Then I brush and it looks and smells good.</li>
            <li>Geared towards being gender neutral, so it would be good for guys,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone came up with this!  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo and blends great.</li>
            <li>When you toss your hair to spray the product, you will get a bit of brown on your fingers, but it washes off with water very easily.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of making my hair look fresh.</li>
            <li>, although the scent is not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t really pleasant either.</li>
            <li>I have used Treseme before and this product is100% better.</li>
            <li>not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo  I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>Love this for quick freshen ups!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic for camping too.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again if it was free of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t look white/powdery like other products</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and DOES NOT weigh your hair down</li>
            <li>What makes this a stellar product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white reside and it cheap, cheap, cheap!  </li>
            <li>It actually absorbed all</li>
            <li>oh the oil and made my hair feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have also used many drug store type sprays, and NONE of them come anywhere near the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do second day hair because my hair simply gets too oily, but I think I may be able to get to 3 days with this.</li>
            <li>If I am going to spend extra moolah on a specialized product, I want it to be better than baby powder.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dry shampoo brand.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is nice (although far too overpowering of other perfumes one might use), but it has given me an intense headache both times I&#x27;ve tried it.  </li>
            <li>It does not cover-up my high lights or make my hair any darker.</li>
            <li>the the Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>The brown coloring helps a lot as most dry shampoos are white</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine, limp hair</li>
            <li>This product actually DOESN&#x27;T SHOW in my hair, and my professional hairdresser ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  </li>
            <li>I also have very oily hair and have to wash it daily.</li>
            <li>Anyone else sensitive to fragrance should shop accordingly.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp so this does irritate my scalp a bit.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most I&#x27;ve tried, I only need a few squirts to get the degreased look.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and thick hair and have to wash it every day in order to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels rough and kind of icky after use, but I&#x27;ve found that to be the case with every dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY reasonably priced dry shampoo that actually works for brunettes.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like it left a brown residue, but when I wiped my previously clean face off with toilet paper, it looked like I had tried to apply fake tanner.</li>
            <li> Also, I do not need as much as other products, so even though it is more expensive it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> and it still left slight white streaks.</li>
            <li> There is never a white powder look to my hair as their was with other products.</li>
            <li> I only wish I could get it a little cheaper....</li>
            <li> Absolutely no sticky residue and it looks and feels like I just washed my hair.</li>
            <li> and I had to wet my head to make the streaks go away.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> I would take off another star for this, except that it makes sense it would do this since it is made specifically for dark hair.</li>
            <li> My baby powder does this, but costs WAY less.</li>
            <li> I have two toned hair, very dark underneath and highlighted at the crown.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li> That was the reason I bought it, so I can hardly complain about it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a weird texture, smell or color in my hair.  </li>
            <li> gave it 3 stars instead of one or two because it did soak up the oil and did not make my hair feel too weird -</li>
            <li> But it does get me through a day if I&#x27;m unable to wash my hair that day.</li>
            <li> noticeable was how dirty it made my face after applying it.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> although there was a noticeable difference in texture, it just wasn&#x27;t a bad</li>

            <li> Best dry shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I have used Treseme before and this product is100% better. I have brown hair with some highlights and low lights. I also have very oily hair and have to wash it daily. This product is great for days I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. Also, we camp a lot and it is fantastic for camping too. When you toss your hair to spray the product, you will get a bit of brown on your fingers, but it washes off with water very easily. It does not cover-up my high lights or make my hair any darker. There is never a white powder look to my hair as their was with other products. Also, I do not need as much as other products, so even though it is more expensive it lasts longer. Definitely worth the price! I have ordered it multiple times now, and in bulk.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo brand.  My hair loves it too.  Not sticky and not too chalky.</li>

            <li> Works perfect when I&#x27;m in a rush and can&#x27;t wash my hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this product.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t look white/powdery like other products she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is nice (although far too overpowering of other perfumes one might use), but it has given me an intense headache both times I&#x27;ve tried it.  Anyone else sensitive to fragrance should shop accordingly.  I would buy this again if it was free of fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo and blends great.</li>
            <li> I sweat in my sleep and my hair gets oily at times. My answer to this has been to put a bit of baby powder in my hair and then go to sleep. The baby powder does leave white residue, but it evens out while I sleep. Then I brush and it looks and smells good. On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed and it still left slight white streaks. They weren&#x27;t as bad the the Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, but still noticeable. My baby powder does this, but costs WAY less. If I am going to spend extra moolah on a specialized product, I want it to be better than baby powder. The spray DID NOT even out as I slept and I had to wet my head to make the streaks go away. Brushing helped only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although the scent is not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t really pleasant either. Geared towards being gender neutral, so it would be good for guys, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars instead of one or two because it did soak up the oil and did not make my hair feel too weird - although there was a noticeable difference in texture, it just wasn&#x27;t a bad difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also noticeable was how dirty it made my face after applying it. It didn&#x27;t look like it left a brown residue, but when I wiped my previously clean face off with toilet paper, it looked like I had tried to apply fake tanner. I would take off another star for this, except that it makes sense it would do this since it is made specifically for dark hair. That was the reason I bought it, so I can hardly complain about it. I will just wash my face after each application.</li>
            <li> This is an essential hair product for me.  I have very oily and thick hair and have to wash it every day in order to keep it clean.  However, for those days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash, I use this product and it does what it says.  My hair feels rough and kind of icky after use, but I&#x27;ve found that to be the case with every dry shampoo.  What makes this a stellar product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white reside and it cheap, cheap, cheap!  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> works great.  not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this for some time.  I have also used many drug store type sprays, and NONE of them come anywhere near the performance of this product.  I have two toned hair, very dark underneath and highlighted at the crown.  This product actually DOESN&#x27;T SHOW in my hair, and my professional hairdresser ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  It has a great smell and DOES NOT weigh your hair down (my hair is almost waist length, so that matters to me).  I only wish I could get it a little cheaper....LOL.  Have a great day!  :)</li>
            <li> Love love love.  No white residue in my brunette hair!</li>
            <li> The ONLY reasonably priced dry shampoo that actually works for brunettes. Unlike most I&#x27;ve tried, I only need a few squirts to get the degreased look. I have medium length, fine, limp hair and I use it daily whether I&#x27;ve showered or not. Adds extra volume and texture to my otherwise lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells and it does a great job of making my hair look fresh.</li>
            <li> Wish they sold this stuff in stores here. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo  I have ever bought.  I will never buy another kind--creates volume and is tinted to my hair color. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> The item turned out not to be what I thought.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp so this does irritate my scalp a bit.  But it does get me through a day if I&#x27;m unable to wash my hair that day. I do like that it has the bit of coloring so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have gray hair after using the white stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this when I shower at night to keep my hair from looking greasy. The brown coloring helps a lot as most dry shampoos are white then you look like you have dandruff when you use it.</li>
