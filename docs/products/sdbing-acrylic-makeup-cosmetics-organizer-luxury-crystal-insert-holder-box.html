            <li>Excellent acrylic quality, perfect design and the black drawer inserts keep from your make up containers from sliding.</li>
            <li>It keeps every thing neat and tidy...</li>
            <li>Perfect size and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I thought the acrylic would need to be cleaned often to keep it looking nice</li>
            <li>Now, originally, I liked this set, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>nice and compact.</li>
            <li>My make up looks beautiful and is right in front of me</li>
            <li>my items fit good</li>

            <li>It has tons of rooms in the drawers, which I was super happy about since I have so many eye shadows.</li>
            <li>This is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Looks great for a modern look without clutter.  </li>
            <li>Top piece moves if you grab item from top, hence 4*.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this.</li>
            <li>will cost more than the damn purchase.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I did use the top portion as a makeup tray, but the drawers I did use for jewelry.</li>
            <li>I just love it...</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>This has simplified my apartment bathroom and given me more room.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Have most of my make-up stored in it.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and find it more convenient than shoving everything in a make up bag.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was able to get most, but not all, of my products organized which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The top part doesn&#x27;t stay put or fit correct and falls/slides off the top of the box too.</li>
            <li>The cosmetics organizer allows me to keep all my makeup supplies clean and well organized I like it!</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, $20 item at MOST.</li>
            <li>Things that were lost are now easily located.</li>
            <li>The drawers slide in and out easily for me.  </li>
            <li>Helped me organize easily</li>
            <li>Have to wipe off water splashes as it spots easily, but not the fault of the container.</li>
            <li>and I can view what I have easily</li>
            <li>It has great room at top for all different sizes of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It helps keep everything organized and easy to see all of my items.</li>
            <li>Also, the organizer on top is super convenient and helps hold my miscellaneous makeup items.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my dresser top, but it holds a ton of makeup!  </li>
            <li>for example, if the cover to my eyeshadow was too bulky, it wasn&#x27;t going to fit.</li>
            <li>Though it does hold a lot it is not big just a very nice size no matter what size vanity you put it on.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>For some reason I could not find this kind in my local stores so I am glad Amazon carries it, even if it did come from overseas.  </li>
            <li>but this holds so much I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a much sturdier feel and just seems like a better quality organizer.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER STURDY.</li>
            <li>Purchased acrylic file organizer for cook books-looks super</li>
            <li>The seller quickly resolved the issue.</li>
            <li>so if you have flat things such as palettes and concealers then this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this item as it looked clean and seemed to fit my organization needs.</li>
            <li>Makes things that are usually a mess look great.</li>
            <li>Great little organizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller width wise than I thought, but I was able to get all the makeup I needed in it and on top.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the quality is good and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The variety of compartments and size is just right; not too bulky either.</li>
            <li>The fit together fine, had no broken or stuck drawers, and it&#x27;s classy looking and organizational.</li>
            <li>It comes with lovely black drawer liners should you choose to perhaps store your makeup on top and some jewelry below.</li>
            <li>it looks great in my room, I will probably end up buying a second one or a bigger one.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller (Sell D Best) for a refund and though they responded quickly and said they would refund the initial cost, the item was originally shipped from China and the shipping fee to return it would cost me between $20-30 dollars--the seller offered to refund only half for a damaged item</li>
            <li>It is working pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting something larger and more substantial.</li>
            <li>The acrylic with the built in handles makes it pretty.  </li>
            <li>While it looked nice like in the pictures, it did not work at all, meaning the drawers stick together, don&#x27;t open or slide and fall on top of each other.</li>
            <li>It took a long time for me to receive it and it came with a crack on the top of the case on the corner.</li>
            <li>The drawers and holders are so small it defeats the purpose of being an ORGANIZER because I can&#x27;t even fit more than a couple of things into the drawer.</li>
            <li>There were certain compartment</li>
            <li>Style is sleek and modern.</li>
            <li>Its much smaller than the picture depicts, and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>It is very roomy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than the ones in the container store.</li>
            <li>Drawers slide very well also.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t use the Holder Box as anticipated, I found another use for it and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I paid sooo much money for these and they sell them for $12 at TJ maxx and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original box (which was not sturdy) without any further protection.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear much, so It&#x27;s nice to have a place for it to all go.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is decent quality.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the draws were the main reason i couldn&#x27;t be bothered with it.</li>
            <li>The drawers and the open tray that sits on top came in two separate boxes but wrapped together in the same shipping package.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, however the box was obviously re used from another order that was probably returned because of the condition this came in.</li>
            <li>I had high hope for this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the top needs to be a little wider.</li>
            <li>I love the drawers and the little spaces for my make-up.</li>
            <li>I originally wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this because it was a bit more expensive than other organizers I had seen</li>
            <li>I believe that it would have been a good product had it not been broken.</li>
            <li>The organizer had a huge crack in the back and additional cracks in the back corner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because reading other reviews people said it was a lot smaller</li>
            <li>This actually holds alot more than I had expected!</li>
            <li>pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>This arrived a week early, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Both were wrapped very well in several layers of wrapping...</li>
            <li>Plus it arrived early.</li>
            <li>There are tiny scratches and fingerprints all over it, and a large scratch on the back.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little bigger because not all my makeup fit there</li>
            <li>Compartments would not have fit any common cosmetic.</li>
            <li>My order arrived much sooner than I expected, after only just over a week as opposed to the estimated 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t envision it quite so small even though I read the dimensions ahead of time, and the black foam in the drawers is much tackier looking in person than it is in the picture, but overall it&#x27;s pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>it came all wrapped up not broken or scrathed up like some of the previous reviews</li>

    <ol>
            <li> for makeup and other items, my only wish was that it had larger dimensions. I was expecting it to be bigger than what it is. It&#x27;s a tad expensive but it&#x27;s quality made so it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC! It is SUPER STURDY. Heavy acrylic and holds everything. Ever wonder how to store that awkwardly shaped eyelash curler? Here&#x27;s your answer. And it is so attractive you wont mind having it on your dresser. It comes with lovely black drawer liners should you choose to perhaps store your makeup on top and some jewelry below. I thought I had quite a bit of makeup but this holds so much I need to buy more. Though it does hold a lot it is not big just a very nice size no matter what size vanity you put it on.</li>
            <li> I found this organizer to be just what was needed for my small living space.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my dresser top, but it holds a ton of makeup!  Style is sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> The drawers could use to be a little deeper and maybe some dividers in the 2 long drawers.  I purchased another set of drawers for the rest of my make up--- It keeps every thing neat and tidy...</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this item as it looked clean and seemed to fit my organization needs. It took over a month to receive it and when it arrived it was in it&#x27;s original box (which was crushed) in a thin plastic bag with no padding. While it looked nice like in the pictures, it did not work at all, meaning the drawers stick together, don&#x27;t open or slide and fall on top of each other. The top part doesn&#x27;t stay put or fit correct and falls/slides off the top of the box too. I contacted the seller (Sell D Best) for a refund and though they responded quickly and said they would refund the initial cost, the item was originally shipped from China and the shipping fee to return it would cost me between $20-30 dollars--the seller offered to refund only half for a damaged item and they also wanted me to send them a picture of the damaged item. Never again will I order from a non- Amazon certified seller--next time I&#x27;ll research where items are coming from. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Using this organizer in kitchen to house &amp;#34;kitchen stuff&amp;#34;. Looks great for a modern look without clutter.  Top piece moves if you grab item from top, hence 4*. Purchased acrylic file organizer for cook books-looks super</li>
            <li> The variety of compartments and size is just right; not too bulky either. I use it to hold my everyday cosmetics, brushes, jewelry, cleansers, etc... I thought the acrylic would need to be cleaned often to keep it looking nice but I&#x27;ve had it months now and have had to wipe it down 1 time. Probably get another in the future.</li>
            <li> No scratches or cracks. I am looking forward to ordering a similar case to store my makeup. It is kinda small.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this. I put all my makeup in this cosmetic organizer, and now it&#x27;s all neat and organized. I wish it was a little bigger because not all my makeup fit there but I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Is compact it looks great in my room, I will probably end up buying a second one or a bigger one.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this,  it is a good size.  I bought it for her for a Christmas present,  It did how&#x27;re take a good while to receive so don&#x27;t order this at the last minute</li>
            <li> I was hoping the drawers would be deeper and the top needs to be a little wider. It is working pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> The outer Amazon box was in pristine shape and there was ample padding, but the inner box that contained the actual item was damaged. It appears like the damage occurred prior to it being put in the shipping box. The organizer had a huge crack in the back and additional cracks in the back corner. It&#x27;s completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely brilliant. My make up looks beautiful and is right in front of me so I can grab it whenever I need it.  Makes things that are usually a mess look great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this product was being shipped from China.  It was shipped in it&#x27;s original box (which was not sturdy) without any further protection.  I also had to take photos of the damage, but the company was quite responsive in crediting my account.  I believe that it would have been a good product had it not been broken.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It looks and works great! I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It neatens up the cosmetics. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting something larger and more substantial. I was able to get most, but not all, of my products organized which is a huge plus. Things that were lost are now easily located. The acrylic is decent quality. It&#x27;s just a bit nuts to spend over $40 on some plastic drawers!</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this item. However, when I received it the packaged was damaged but the shipping box was not damaged so it indicates that the box was damaged prior to shipping. Secondly the both parts were BROKEN. This is no use to me I did not get to use it! but thirdly, the most disgusting part of this purchase is that this item was bought under the impression that it was new but it was USED and had hair shaving all over it not only that but it was dirty!!! I will NEVER order from this seller again NEVER AGAIN!!! I HATE IT!!! The sad part is that I live outside of the USA and to ship it back will cost more than the damn purchase.</li>
            <li> pretty much what I expected. I put it to good use</li>
            <li> Looked like the item was badly cracked before packaged. Does not offer exchange or replacement. I had to go through repackaging and drop it off to a local UPS.</li>
            <li> Excellent acrylic quality, perfect design and the black drawer inserts keep from your make up containers from sliding. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t packaged correctly, i suppose.  It arrived broken.  other than that ok.  There were certain compartment I don&#x27;t know what it could have contained.  Compartments would not have fit any common cosmetic.</li>
            <li> The drawers aren&#x27;t really deep enough for makeup jars.  I did use the top portion as a makeup tray, but the drawers I did use for jewelry.</li>
            <li> Always a quality product with no issues and a good Seller.</li>
            <li> Good quality and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I had anticipated a larger storage device.  Maybe I missed the details of the specs.</li>
            <li> I just love it... it came all wrapped up not broken or scrathed up like some of the previous reviews say it the perfect size for my dresser might need to get another one but for now it&#x27;s just right thxs amazon</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because reading other reviews people said it was a lot smaller then what they anticipated, But for me it was the perfect size! and actually bigger! I don&#x27;t have enough make-up to fill it all up! for women/girls that are &amp;#34;beauty queens&amp;#34; or just have a lot of make-up I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this just cause it would be too small.&lt;br /&gt;But I love the drawers and the little spaces for my make-up. I don&#x27;t usually wear much, so It&#x27;s nice to have a place for it to all go.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother. Now, originally, I liked this set, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It just didn&#x27;t have the space i need. so i opted for a cosmetics case/train. Anyway, the draws were the main reason i couldn&#x27;t be bothered with it. It was annoying to force pull and push and that black material inside, looks like crap. not to mention, the draws are deep, but it lacks in height. for example, if the cover to my eyeshadow was too bulky, it wasn&#x27;t going to fit. so if you have flat things such as palettes and concealers then this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this and it works perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> Great storage for make up</li>
            <li> Great little organizer.</li>
            <li> This cosmetics case has a lot of room for my makeup and brushes. It has only 4 lipstick holders which I thought was enough for me. But with holding the foundations and the brushes and the drawers holding my eyeshadow sits enough space. It took a long time for me to receive it and it came with a crack on the top of the case on the corner. It was packaged tightly when I received though. The seller quickly resolved the issue.</li>
            <li> The best thing ever. Perfect size and fit for my make up collection</li>
            <li> Holds a ton of stuff and looks great on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My order arrived much sooner than I expected, after only just over a week as opposed to the estimated 4-6 weeks. The drawers and the open tray that sits on top came in two separate boxes but wrapped together in the same shipping package. Both were wrapped very well in several layers of wrapping... a bag surrounded by a box, surrounded by bubble wrap, enclosed in another bag, surrounded by a thick layer of packing tape, all inside a DHL shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boxes looked like they came from different suppliers. One of the boxes was plain white and unmarked, and the other box looked like something you&#x27;d find on a shelf in the a store, with advertising and a product description on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the discrepancy between the boxes doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. The fit together fine, had no broken or stuck drawers, and it&#x27;s classy looking and organizational. Plus it arrived early. I didn&#x27;t envision it quite so small even though I read the dimensions ahead of time, and the black foam in the drawers is much tackier looking in person than it is in the picture, but overall it&#x27;s pretty much what I expected. I think I&#x27;ll just take the foam out. It&#x27;s not glued in or anything.</li>
            <li> This arrived a week early, I was pleasantly surprised!  It&#x27;s a little smaller width wise than I thought, but I was able to get all the makeup I needed in it and on top. This has simplified my apartment bathroom and given me more room. The acrylic with the built in handles makes it pretty.  Each drawer did come with the black layer of tight netted material to keep the contents from sliding around in the drawers.  The drawers slide in and out easily for me.  I am so impressed!  For some reason I could not find this kind in my local stores so I am glad Amazon carries it, even if it did come from overseas.  I may order another one in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, $20 item at MOST. It arrived quickly, however the box was obviously re used from another order that was probably returned because of the condition this came in. There are tiny scratches and fingerprints all over it, and a large scratch on the back. Its much smaller than the picture depicts, and feels cheap. The drawers and holders are so small it defeats the purpose of being an ORGANIZER because I can&#x27;t even fit more than a couple of things into the drawer. NOT a happy customer at all.</li>
            <li> This actually holds alot more than I had expected! Love it</li>
            <li> nice and compact. Helped me organize easily</li>
            <li> It is very roomy.  Have most of my make-up stored in it.  It is an attractive addition to my dressing table.</li>
            <li> works great.  Have to wipe off water splashes as it spots easily, but not the fault of the container.</li>
            <li> Very handy tool. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the ones in the container store. This one came with good quality. I got rid of the black lining sheets that came with the box, those are poor quality and black fibers fell everywhere! I had to wash the entire set to get rid of those. Other than that, the quality is good and sturdy. Drawers slide very well also. Wish they make them with taller drawers though.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t use the Holder Box as anticipated, I found another use for it and it works very well.  I like the Organizer tray and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have been bigger but it works and my items fit good and I can view what I have easily</li>
            <li> Worth the price! I originally wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this because it was a bit more expensive than other organizers I had seen but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a much sturdier feel and just seems like a better quality organizer. Also, the organizer on top is super convenient and helps hold my miscellaneous makeup items. The drawers are a bit thin so you can really on fit pens or a thin palette inside, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I paid sooo much money for these and they sell them for $12 at TJ maxx and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</li>
            <li> Was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> The cosmetics organizer allows me to keep all my makeup supplies clean and well organized I like it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and find it more convenient than shoving everything in a make up bag. It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is extremely small and very misleading.  It doesn&#x27;t have room for ANYTHING.  I suppose if you hardly have any makeup or brushes you could find it useful, but if you have an average amount of products then this is NOT for you</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful! It has great room at top for all different sizes of cosmetics. The drawers is where I store all my eye shadows, bronzers, and other flatter cosmetics. It has tons of rooms in the drawers, which I was super happy about since I have so many eye shadows. It helps keep everything organized and easy to see all of my items. I am very happy I purchased this item and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it but it&#x27;s just a little small.</li>
            <li> Love the organizer nice looking and keeps my makeup in order.</li>
