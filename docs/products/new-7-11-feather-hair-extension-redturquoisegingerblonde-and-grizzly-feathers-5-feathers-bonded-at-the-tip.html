            <li>and they didn&#x27;t look all that nice.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think she liked them either</li>
            <li>The reds are really nice color combination with the turquoise and grizzly.  </li>
            <li>The feathers are gorgeous, the reason why I gave them 2 stars is because the seller never specify how many comes in the packages.</li>
            <li>Vibrant, great quality for a great price :)</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the product so far</li>
            <li>so I was very pleased with how quickly I got it !</li>
            <li>They look really cute and were easy to put on!</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the fact that it comes with two extension beads.</li>
            <li>:) They&#x27;re quality feather extensions.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to get more in the packet.</li>
            <li>I received the product right away, so that was nice.  </li>
            <li>mailed fine and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for someone with fuller hair.</li>
            <li>I thought that they would have been more bold as the pictures showed.  </li>
            <li>I do get a lot of compliments on them and they are a lot of fun for the summer !</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and it was fairly simple to put the extension on.</li>
            <li>They arrived super quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put them in my hair and the color stays pretty good for several weeks.</li>
            <li>This is the first mishap from this seller though!</li>
            <li>The pictures show more natural colors</li>
            <li>Other than that the feather is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I love these and have ordered them several times and the color and length is as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd batch of hair feathers I&#x27;ve ordered from Sexy Sparkles.</li>
            <li>will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li>I suppose because after the first shower, they fell apart.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the top poked out a little.</li>
            <li>Great for someone who wants to be natural with a slight pop of color.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it because it looks fantastic in my red hair!</li>
            <li>Not as full as I was expecting, but they look nice in your hair, especially if you take the time to really apply them properly.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from a few other sites and SS carries the BEST product!</li>
            <li>Very pretty and professional packaging which included two micro beads with each extension ordered.</li>
            <li>They curl, straighten, and wash just like real hair.</li>
            <li>i also expected to get more than one feather</li>
            <li>the picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>The photo shows a far more feathers than is actually contained in the package.  </li>
            <li>All in all I really do like these and would purchase them again as they are very resonably priced and decent quality for what you pay for them.</li>
            <li>so I can have a nice solid bunch in my hair instead of a single feather here and there.  </li>
            <li>Typically they last forever and are lovely!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally care to leave a comment</li>
            <li>I had also expected to be able to style these with my hair as I have had other feathers in my hair before that were able to be curled/ straightened etc and with these feathers the first time I tried to curl them one of the feathers snapped off at the end about half an inch.</li>
            <li>Sad, it had beautiful potential!</li>
            <li>When I received the package, only one feather came in the package, and the price seems very high for ONE feather.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered 2 batches, and one was not bound very well</li>
            <li>but I opened up feathers that were electric blue, and hot pink.</li>
            <li>It is so difficult to stuff all the individual feathers in so it is amazing</li>

            <li> It is so difficult to stuff all the individual feathers in so it is amazing</li>
            <li> Just be ware that you should be very careful using hot styling tools with them and that the color may differ slightly from the actual picture .</li>
            <li> They hold up well and take a long time to fade.  </li>
            <li> She wore them for a long time.</li>
            <li> 1 tiny strand of feather, what a joke, don&#x27;t waste your money the dollar tree has the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly dissapointed in the actual color of the feathers as the feathers looked very vibrantly red in the picture and in person they are magenta pink .</li>
            <li> I recieved this purchase well before the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these and other colours</li>
            <li> i saw the pictures and looked at the other pictures</li>
            <li> and im hoping itll last for at least a few days.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few feather hair extensions from SS</li>
            <li> The descriptions says &amp;#34;5 feathers bonded at the tip&amp;#34;, but the illustration indicated that there were several bundles in the package - that is what we expected and were very disappointed at finding so few.</li>
            <li> , the picture is ridiculous..  </li>
            <li> This is a sad bundle!</li>
            <li> was i wrong!</li>
            <li> , haven&#x27;t seen her wear them :(</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed in the colors.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these and other colours so I am a repeat customer.  I find these the best price and good quality feathers plus they are the most convenient as they come bonded so I can have a nice solid bunch in my hair instead of a single feather here and there.  These last several months, I just re-do them as they grow out with my hair.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I paid for. Love the colors and the fact that it comes with two extension beads. :) They&#x27;re quality feather extensions. They curl, straighten, and wash just like real hair. Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I love these and have ordered them several times and the color and length is as advertised.  They hold up well and take a long time to fade.  I put them in my hair and the color stays pretty good for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a sad bundle! i saw the pictures and looked at the other pictures and I thought this will be a beautiful bundle of feathers and boy was i wrong! I&#x27;m going to put this bundle in a friends hair and be done with it.. Sad, it had beautiful potential!</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get more in the packet. and they didn&#x27;t look all that nice. got them for my niece and I don&#x27;t think she liked them either, haven&#x27;t seen her wear them :(</li>
            <li> I ordered a few feather hair extensions from SS and they arrived in just over a week. Very pretty and professional packaging which included two micro beads with each extension ordered. They were all packaged separately with instructions on the back of each. I have ordered from a few other sites and SS carries the BEST product! It is so difficult to stuff all the individual feathers in so it is amazing that SS has them bonded at the tip. I don&#x27;t normally care to leave a comment but this time I had to! Vibrant, great quality for a great price :) Thank you SEXY sparkles!</li>
            <li> love the colors and look awesome in my hair</li>
            <li> The feathers are awesome and look great, but the picture is mis leading. There was only one extension.&lt;br /&gt;Everything mailed fine and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for someone with fuller hair. I have fine hair and the top poked out a little.</li>
            <li> 1 tiny strand of feather, what a joke, don&#x27;t waste your money the dollar tree has the same thing.  Again you get 1 strand, the picture is ridiculous..  Shame on them.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feathers! i just wish they were longer!</li>
            <li> I recieved this purchase well before the expected delivery date so I was very pleased with how quickly I got it ! I was slightly dissapointed in the actual color of the feathers as the feathers looked very vibrantly red in the picture and in person they are magenta pink . I had also expected to be able to style these with my hair as I have had other feathers in my hair before that were able to be curled/ straightened etc and with these feathers the first time I tried to curl them one of the feathers snapped off at the end about half an inch. All in all I really do like these and would purchase them again as they are very resonably priced and decent quality for what you pay for them. Just be ware that you should be very careful using hot styling tools with them and that the color may differ slightly from the actual picture . I do get a lot of compliments on them and they are a lot of fun for the summer !</li>
            <li> Picture is a bit misleading I thaout I was getting several of these like the pictre shows. Was going to share with our friends for an event. The order is for just 1 stand with only 3 fethers. Somewhat disapointed.</li>
            <li> Good feathers for the price. Not as full as I was expecting, but they look nice in your hair, especially if you take the time to really apply them properly.</li>
            <li> Love them! Best quality on amazon! Thank you sexysparkles!</li>
            <li> I like it gonna use it after I re-dye my hair</li>
            <li> The feathers were great, but I didn&#x27;t recieve all of them.</li>
            <li> I separated the feathers and only put the red feathers into my hair. Mine came with 2 red feathers. I really liked them! They look really cute and were easy to put on!</li>
            <li> The pictures show more natural colors but I opened up feathers that were electric blue, and hot pink. i also expected to get more than one feather but I just got one. will not order from this user again.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd batch of hair feathers I&#x27;ve ordered from Sexy Sparkles. I like the price (way cheaper than I have found on Etsy). I like the fact that the ends are bound together so they&#x27;re easier to put in your hair. They arrived super quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as good as the picture when you first get them, but once you put them in your hair they look great!</li>
            <li> I love this seller and buy all of my feathers from her! I recently ordered 2 batches, and one was not bound very well I suppose because after the first shower, they fell apart. I had to go buy hair glue and bind them back together. This is the first mishap from this seller though! Typically they last forever and are lovely!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the feathers, got them on time and in great shape, came with 2 beads to clamp the feathers in place. Will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and it was fairly simple to put the extension on. i had to order the tool for clamping it and puting the hair through but it was worth it because it looks fantastic in my red hair! I am very impressed with the product so far and im hoping itll last for at least a few days. Id definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves them and she received lots of comments and complements over them.  She wore them for a long time.</li>
            <li> The photo shows a far more feathers than is actually contained in the package.  The descriptions says &amp;#34;5 feathers bonded at the tip&amp;#34;, but the illustration indicated that there were several bundles in the package - that is what we expected and were very disappointed at finding so few.</li>
            <li> The reds are really nice color combination with the turquoise and grizzly.  Great for someone who wants to be natural with a slight pop of color.</li>
            <li> the picture is very deceiving. the description is correct. but DONT JUDGE BY THE PICTURE.</li>
            <li> I received the product right away, so that was nice.  However I was disappointed in the colors.  I thought that they would have been more bold as the pictures showed.  Also, i received all grizzly feathers, and no solids which the picture does not depict.</li>
            <li> The feathers are gorgeous, the reason why I gave them 2 stars is because the seller never specify how many comes in the packages. When I received the package, only one feather came in the package, and the price seems very high for ONE feather. Other than that the feather is gorgeous.</li>
