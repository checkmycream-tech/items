            <li>I am very happy with this powder and case!</li>
            <li>Smells great and does not go all over the place and get into the air.</li>
            <li>attractive container to leave on counter in bathroom all the time.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice powder, but does not smell at all like lavender.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this powder is perfect - very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it, I gave it to her as part of her birthday presents.</li>
            <li>The container and puff work great for my body powder though :)</li>
            <li>This is lovely and feels very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Best bath powder for the money; smells great and has a nice, soft puff!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It was nice and had a refreshing scent but not over powering!</li>
            <li>Honestly I bought this just for the container and powder puff.</li>
            <li>Does not smell as nice as I imagined</li>
            <li>The price is also surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product when it was priced much lower.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fine, nicely scented powder.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought for just the perfect size powder container and the puff</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t happen the powder is lovely not just for me</li>
            <li>So I now have to find how to get a refill on the powder!! :-)</li>
            <li>One of my favorite lavender dusting powders.</li>
            <li>lovely addition to the bathing routine.  </li>
            <li>This is one my favorite pampering products.</li>
            <li>I love using the dusting powder after I take a bath.</li>
            <li>It smells FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Lovely, freshly scented lavender talc.</li>
            <li>If you love lavender, order Spring Fresh Dusting powder, and &amp;#34;get the experience&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>keeps dry and smells beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying it so much.  </li>
            <li>i love this powder i have been using it for years and fast shipping</li>
            <li>In an age when dusting powder just isn&#x27;t popular, this was nicely fragrant but very little in container.</li>
            <li>So soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Love the powder but the container is so delicate and cracks easily</li>
            <li>I really like this and the scent.</li>
            <li>It got here fast and I will recommend it.</li>
            <li>The price here is more than certainly gauging as it sells in other stores for 1.79 - 4.00 for the same exact size, quantity and brand.</li>
            <li>Could have a little more fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>The powder is silky soft and feel very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but I just bought the exact same powder for $1.97 at my local Wal-Mart tonight, so this is one product I will be buying local from now on.</li>
            <li>I love it because the smell is not strong.</li>
            <li>My niece enjoys using her new &amp;#34;powder puff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft and heavenly.</li>
            <li>Complete with soft puff for application.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but the scent was very subtle.</li>
            <li>This item is available at the local big box store for a lot less.  </li>
            <li>Usually can&#x27;t beat lavender, but this was not quite right.  </li>

            <li> I am very happy with this powder and case! I actually bought for just the perfect size powder container and the puff I figured I would just dump the powder and replace with mine but it didn&#x27;t happen the powder is lovely not just for me but all the kids like it also 2 boys in that group! It was nice and had a refreshing scent but not over powering! So I now have to find how to get a refill on the powder!! :-)</li>
            <li> Smells great and does not go all over the place and get into the air. Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> The item was just as described and received when promised.  My niece enjoys using her new &amp;#34;powder puff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought this just for the container and powder puff. Threw the talc powder in the yard. Would not suggest any woman use talc on her body because of the risks. The container and puff work great for my body powder though :)</li>
            <li> I love it because the smell is not strong.</li>
            <li> Love the powder but the container is so delicate and cracks easily</li>
            <li> This item is available at the local big box store for a lot less.  I was looking for dusting powder WITHOUT talc.  When I checked the ingredient list, unfortunately TALC was listed first.  I was very disappointed as I thought I had checked carefully prior to placing my order.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lavender dusting powders. I also like the seller, as well. Came well-shipped, too!</li>
            <li> Does not smell as nice as I imagined it would.  Usually can&#x27;t beat lavender, but this was not quite right.  The dusting powder itself felt alright, just not quite as silky as one might wish.</li>
            <li> lovely addition to the bathing routine.  keeps dry and smells beautiful.  attractive container to leave on counter in bathroom all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice powder, but does not smell at all like lavender. I adore all thing with a lavender, so I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> this powder is one of the calmest I have used.  The sent is not going to overwhelm you and the calming of the lavender prevents any rashes that other powders have.  I will not only use this but gift it to my female friends and family</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this powder is perfect - very mild and pleasant. The price is also surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li> This is like putting on silk! So soft and smooth! The fragrance is soft and heavenly.</li>
            <li> In an age when dusting powder just isn&#x27;t popular, this was nicely fragrant but very little in container.</li>

            <li> Lovely, freshly scented lavender talc. Complete with soft puff for application. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very fine, nicely scented powder.  The price here is more than certainly gauging as it sells in other stores for 1.79 - 4.00 for the same exact size, quantity and brand.</li>
            <li> I have reacquainted myself with dusting powder and I&#x27;m enjoying it so much.  This is lovely and feels very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> The rating is for the scent of lavender. I dust my sheets, and my pillowslips with it, and then, after my shower, and i get my pj&#x27;s on, i just drift away with lavender enveloping my senses. If you love lavender, order Spring Fresh Dusting powder, and &amp;#34;get the experience&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best bath powder for the money; smells great and has a nice, soft puff!!</li>
            <li> i love this powder i have been using it for years and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it, I gave it to her as part of her birthday presents.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter. She loves dusting on powder like I do. Hard to find dusting powder with puff for children.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but the scent was very subtle. Could have a little more fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Just received this and don&#x27;t like it. I think I got Tranquil Breeze with a Lavender sticker on it. Smells like soap and the container is blue. Poof doesn&#x27;t have a handle.</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite pampering products. I love using the dusting powder after I take a bath. It smells FABULOUS! The powder is silky soft and feel very luxurious. I&#x27;ve been using the lavender and want to try the other scents next.</li>
