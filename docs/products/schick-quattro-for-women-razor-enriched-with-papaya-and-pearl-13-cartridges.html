            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor and came as advertised.  </li>

            <li>This is a nice pack.</li>
            <li>gives a really nice close shave and my legs</li>
            <li>and I was very happy to find them at such a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already own this razor, and purchased this one so that I could have another razor to put in my upstairs shower.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and also liked it.  </li>
            <li>The razor works just fine, &amp; is a good value for the cost.</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable and feel great in your hand.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very comfortable and glides around knees and up shins with ease.</li>
            <li>Love the design and results in a close shave.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a close shave from it and change the blades more often than should be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seller, though, is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>So glad i relied on the ratings and tried these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Gillette Venus for years, and when it came time to buy more cartridges, I went onto Amazon.</li>
            <li>I finally decided I needed to replace it, and this deal was just too great to pass up!</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>But please leave one for me to order again :-)</li>
            <li>I have to go over my armpits SO many times even though I shave them every day.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors and this deal was cheaper than any retailer I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>So I decided to take a chance on something a bit more pricy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor.</li>
            <li>The product is great, I have very sensitive legs</li>
            <li>I gave her one of my multi-blade razors to try and she loved it so much she had to buy some of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also like the easy to grip rubber coated handle as she uses it in the shower</li>
            <li>The blades dulled very quickly, makes me wonder if this is a knock-off, quality was not up to par.</li>
            <li>Shaves my knee easily.</li>
            <li>This is partly because they give a great close shave, but more because the razors last FOREVER.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so EASY to get them off.</li>
            <li>Also note that the razors have that fine wire over them.</li>
            <li>But, whatever, it worked fine, it&#x27;s lasted me forever.</li>
            <li>Overall she is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She likes the conditioning strips that help the razor glide smoothly and prevent irritation.</li>
            <li>feel so smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was looking for refills primarily when I stumbled upon this package set.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>, no razor burn to speak of, and it still comes out smooth.</li>
            <li>This was such an AMAZING deal!</li>
            <li>My line of work does not call for me to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than in stores, and the model is newer and fits the heads better.</li>
            <li>Schick quatro razors are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>This razor &amp; extra blades shipped quickly and for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again!!</li>
            <li>Super, worth the expense.</li>
            <li>those that say that hairs &amp;#34;tangle&amp;#34; easily with this Quattro they most definitely DO</li>
            <li>This would be a great starter set for a 12 year old with a giant can of shaving gel, but once I&#x27;m through these blades I&#x27;m switching to a Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, just not the smoothest razor</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this razor, but now that I own it and have been using it  for a few months, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>THE Shipping Was Very Fast..</li>
            <li>old Quattro got crud (I don&#x27;t even want to know what it was) very easily because it was so old.</li>
            <li>The razors are great and last a really long time.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor I am able to use and, for some reason, I cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li>But this is a great value, and these will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>Handle is sturdy and easy to use especially around knees.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>The handle is even textured for a better grip with wet</li>
            <li>highly recommend quattro for women!</li>
            <li>Is A Real Challenge..</li>
            <li>post work-out at the gym, this is an appreciated convenience.</li>
            <li>The handle of the razor feels very sturdy, which I like.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much difference there could be in razors.</li>
            <li>This razor is very sturdy and much heavier in weight than any I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>This tends to not happen if I shave my legs very often -- before my hair gets very lengthy.</li>
            <li>To make matters worse, they give me razor burn after one or two uses, which I have never before experienced with Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>Is there really a difference?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be real with you guys here.</li>
            <li>handle of the package I got was light orange, not fuchsia like the regular Quattro I have.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle has very in the way of grip and can be slippery.</li>
            <li>This razor cuts my faceâ€¦causes much blood.</li>
            <li>Of course I went for this instead, and was so surprised to find it had a heftier, more solid feeling grip compared to the flimsy plastic Venus.</li>
            <li>Love this hidden gem of a razor - the small wire guards allow for a quicker more worry free shave.</li>
            <li>My issue is that the blades seem to be too deeply-inlaid in the &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; strips (which actually just feel like rubber), requiring a significant amount of pressure while you&#x27;re shaving, and even then not as close as I received with my disposable Schicks.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simply better quality than other brands.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).</li>
            <li>Super smooth, left my skin very soft, and no razor burn the next day.</li>
            <li>Awesome and has several replaceable blades which each lasts at least 2 weeks if you make sure after use to keep it dry and away from getting wet</li>
            <li>I paid $30 through Amazon and got a new razor, and 12 blades!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands, but always end up coming back to schick.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular brand of razor for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).ap,</li>
            <li>I was using Venus, but their prices got so high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>This is a decent razor, not one of my absolute favorites, but they work pretty well, and it was cheaper than buying locally.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra dough IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>and I can still shave normally</li>
            <li>thing that I must stress is that you DO NOT go to town with the brand new razor, you WILL get razor burn in places you probably don&#x27;t want razor burn.</li>
            <li>As you can see from the pictures it&#x27;s been around, and it was time to change it (and also get new cartridges because I had been using that one for like 3 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I like the cartridges; when money is tight, I&#x27;ve used the same cartridge for upwards of 2-3 months (maybe even more really)</li>
            <li>This product delivered what it offers - don&#x27;t have to shave every day with these razors!</li>
            <li>My original razor lasted me around ten years and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW!</li>
            <li>This razor in particular is a great razor and the cartridges last a long time before having to be changed (at least they do for me!).  </li>
            <li>Have to say WOW</li>
            <li>For far to long I spent money on cheap men&#x27;s disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I had the older version of this razor for about the last five years.</li>
            <li>They go dull very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have only used 1 so far and have gotten</li>
            <li>I tried a five-blade razor, but because of the excessive movement of the blade angle I could not get a close shave, so I switched back to this tried and true product.</li>
            <li>You should be very gentle the first  few times you shave with new cartridges, at least when it comes to the Quattro brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re simply better quality than other brands.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).</li>
            <li> Super smooth, left my skin very soft, and no razor burn the next day.</li>
            <li> Awesome and has several replaceable blades which each lasts at least 2 weeks if you make sure after use to keep it dry and away from getting wet</li>
            <li> I paid $30 through Amazon and got a new razor, and 12 blades!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands, but always end up coming back to schick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular brand of razor for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).ap,</li>
            <li> I was using Venus, but their prices got so high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, not one of my absolute favorites, but they work pretty well, and it was cheaper than buying locally.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra dough IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> and I can still shave normally</li>
            <li> thing that I must stress is that you DO NOT go to town with the brand new razor, you WILL get razor burn in places you probably don&#x27;t want razor burn.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the pictures it&#x27;s been around, and it was time to change it (and also get new cartridges because I had been using that one for like 3 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I like the cartridges; when money is tight, I&#x27;ve used the same cartridge for upwards of 2-3 months (maybe even more really)</li>
            <li> This product delivered what it offers - don&#x27;t have to shave every day with these razors!</li>
            <li> My original razor lasted me around ten years and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW!</li>
            <li> This razor in particular is a great razor and the cartridges last a long time before having to be changed (at least they do for me!).  </li>
            <li> Have to say WOW</li>
            <li> For far to long I spent money on cheap men&#x27;s disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this razor for about the last five years.</li>
            <li> They go dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only used 1 so far and have gotten</li>
            <li> I tried a five-blade razor, but because of the excessive movement of the blade angle I could not get a close shave, so I switched back to this tried and true product.</li>
            <li> You should be very gentle the first  few times you shave with new cartridges, at least when it comes to the Quattro brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchase the bigger packs because I don&#x27;t need new handles, I&#x27;m trying to cut down on the plastic I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and if you use a nice soap the blade will last at least two weeks if not more.</li>
            <li> Thought about giving it away a few times (with new blades of course) and moving on to something different.</li>
            <li> They last SOOoo long!</li>
            <li> These cartridges will last you a very long time if you want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about brand new cartridges but they&#x27;re always TOO sharp, and you must treat yourself and the razor very gently for a week or so, so the cartridge can maybe dull itself a little and not damage your skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the razors get jammed with hair when you shave, and it doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> They last a long time with regard to staying sharp though.</li>
            <li> The razor blade and refill cartridges sent are orange, not pink like the typical Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li> The fancy strips at the top and bottom turned to slimy gunk after just one use rendering them useless leaving me with a mess.</li>
            <li> These razors are not the same quality as other Schick Quattro refills I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> While more expensive, they provide a close shave with little to no razor burn.</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it, and I&#x27;ve been using that Quattro razor for a very long time (something like 5 years).</li>
            <li> I was expecting, I got a limited edition one.</li>
            <li> Instead of a single handle and three refill cartridges, it&#x27;s three separate starter packs of handles and blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes that the multi-blade design stays sharp and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Razors stay sharp a long time.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m Disabled With My Back..</li>
            <li> It arrived at my home only a few days after I had ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love and hate to share this at the same time-</li>
            <li> But Other Than That ,All Is Well..</li>
            <li> It shaves extremely closely without nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li> Double blades usually.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the dark pink razor like mine</li>
            <li> Limited edition!!!  </li>
            <li> Quattro razors are the only razors I use - I&#x27;m clumsy and tend to nick myself with anything else.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> These little pack lasted me almost a year and a half!</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few razors I can use.</li>
            <li> These are really plain razors.</li>
            <li> You can seriously use a single cartridge for a couple of weeks, at least.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my handle is just flimsy, but I lose the razor head while shaving at least 3 times during a typical session.</li>
            <li> These work just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but the razor blades in this package seem to have a nick or spur on them</li>
            <li> As usual you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to get it out because the crevices are so small.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors that do not give me some mad razor burn</li>
            <li> This product was less expensive to purchase with the combination shaver and blades than to just purchase replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 and 5 blade design razors for years and my wife asked me why because she was tired of the style of razors she was using.</li>
            <li> My razor was unnecessarily bulky</li>
            <li> Cause All Of Us Women,Know How Expensive Razors Can Be....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the package that we bought came with about 20 blade refills, so I&#x27;ll have a while before I&#x27;m finished with them.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that I had to buy me one.</li>
            <li> Also in fear of cutting myself if I should lose my grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Any girl knows, razors are expensive!</li>
            <li> I never considered razors to be tricky until I tried a Venus Embrace and absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Razors and cartridges have become outrageous in price these days.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this hidden gem of a razor - the small wire guards allow for a quicker more worry free shave.</li>
            <li> Good price and plenty of replacement cartridges</li>
            <li> I have used 4 and 5 blade design razors for years and my wife asked me why because she was tired of the style of razors she was using. I gave her one of my multi-blade razors to try and she loved it so much she had to buy some of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that the multi-blade design stays sharp and lasts a long time. It gives her a close shave and the pivoting head helps to follow the contour of her body. She also like the easy to grip rubber coated handle as she uses it in the shower and she feels like she has good control over the razor to get a good close shave. The handle is even textured for a better grip with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the conditioning strips that help the razor glide smoothly and prevent irritation. Overall she is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to you!</li>
            <li> This product was less expensive to purchase with the combination shaver and blades than to just purchase replacement blades. Love the design and results in a close shave.</li>
            <li> I love and hate to share this at the same time- But I parched these in January 2014. I&#x27;m now writing their review in June 2015 because I was just looking to purchase a 2nd pack. These little pack lasted me almost a year and a half! They last SOOoo long! This is the best deal for razors out there. I was using Venus, but their prices got so high. These work just as well, if not better. I&#x27;m hooked on this pack!</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack. The razors are great and last a really long time.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite razor. it&#x27;s very comfortable and glides around knees and up shins with ease. gives a really nice close shave and my legs feel so smooth afterward. i use hair conditioner as a \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot; which also helps soften the hair and leave my skin silky after shaving. highly recommend quattro for women!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these razors!!  These are the only razors that do not give me some mad razor burn and I was very happy to find them at such a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the razors didn&#x27;t want to release the blade, but since it came with 3 razors, that was not a big issue for me!</li>
            <li> This Schick Razor Does Give A Really Good Close Shave,It Was An Excellent Deal For The Razor And All Those Cartridges..Cause All Of Us Women,Know How Expensive Razors Can Be....But My Problem With It,&lt;br /&gt;Was The Dang Cartridges Keep Popping Off The Razor Itself..And I&#x27;m Disabled With My Back..So Me Keep Having To Bend Over To Pick Them Up Is A Real Challenge..And I Fell In The Shower Trying To Get The Dang Cartridge..But Other Than That ,All Is Well..THE Shipping Was Very Fast..&lt;br /&gt;Great Deal If You Don&#x27;t Mind Doing Toe Touches.LOL</li>
            <li> Comfortable and smooth shave. Great value.</li>
            <li> I already own this razor, and purchased this one so that I could have another razor to put in my upstairs shower.  I love this razor.  Not sure why, but the razor blades in this package seem to have a nick or spur on them so when I&#x27;m shaving, I can feel it scratching my skin.  Never noticed this with the razor blades I bought in the store.  Maybe I just got a defective batch.</li>
            <li> I was looking for refills primarily when I stumbled upon this package set. Now I have a spare razor to keep in my gym bag! Considering the majority of my showering happens post work-out at the gym, this is an appreciated convenience.</li>
            <li> Perfect smooth shave!  This product delivered what it offers - don&#x27;t have to shave every day with these razors!</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I am able to use and, for some reason, I cannot find it in stores. Love the ease of purchasing it at Amazon and the price is great, too.</li>
            <li> Quattro razors are the only razors I use - I&#x27;m clumsy and tend to nick myself with anything else.  This a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The blades dulled very quickly, makes me wonder if this is a knock-off, quality was not up to par.</li>
            <li> These razors are not the same quality as other Schick Quattro refills I&#x27;ve purchased. They go dull very quickly. I thought the price was too good to be true. As usual you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The razor works just fine, &amp; is a good value for the cost. However,  this is not the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t get a close shave from it and change the blades more often than should be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, though, is fantastic!  My razor handle was defective (they would never have known until the package had been opened) and they immediately sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> We did not purchase these on Amazon, but from our local Sam&#x27;s Club. For years I had been using the disposable Schick 3-blades, but decided to finally spend the extra for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor. Personally, I prefer the others... Unfortunately, the package that we bought came with about 20 blade refills, so I&#x27;ll have a while before I&#x27;m finished with them. The handle of the razor feels very sturdy, which I like. My issue is that the blades seem to be too deeply-inlaid in the &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; strips (which actually just feel like rubber), requiring a significant amount of pressure while you&#x27;re shaving, and even then not as close as I received with my disposable Schicks.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, good price.</li>
            <li> I never thought about buying a schick until I ran out of my razors and I used my husband&#x27;s schick. Needless to say that I had to buy me one.</li>
            <li> Limited edition!!!  Woohoo!!!</li>
            <li> I never realized how much difference there could be in razors. Shaves my knee easily. So glad i relied on the ratings and tried these</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  This razor is very sturdy and much heavier in weight than any I&#x27;ve owned.  It shaves extremely closely without nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li> The swivel head on this razor makes all the difference, in all the places you might want to shave. Super, worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Gillette Venus for years, and when it came time to buy more cartridges, I went onto Amazon. The same amount of cartridges as in this pack would have cost me $80 if I&#x27;d stuck with Gillette! Of course I went for this instead, and was so surprised to find it had a heftier, more solid feeling grip compared to the flimsy plastic Venus. As for the shave...It was hands-down the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Super smooth, left my skin very soft, and no razor burn the next day. I won&#x27;t be going back!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this razor for about the last five years. I finally decided I needed to replace it, and this deal was just too great to pass up! So much cheaper than in stores, and the model is newer and fits the heads better. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Awesome and has several replaceable blades which each lasts at least 2 weeks if you make sure after use to keep it dry and away from getting wet so it doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Great value! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the razors get jammed with hair when you shave, and it doesn&#x27;t come out. There&#x27;s no way to get it out because the crevices are so small. This tends to not happen if I shave my legs very often -- before my hair gets very lengthy. They last a long time with regard to staying sharp though. You also get a lot of razors for your money!</li>
            <li> good value, great razors!</li>
            <li> The razor blade and refill cartridges sent are orange, not pink like the typical Schick Quattro.  To make matters worse, they give me razor burn after one or two uses, which I have never before experienced with Schick Quattro.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> OK.  Not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these razors from the local Rite Aid and I loved it.  My daughter tried it and also liked it.  Went on Amazon and found this combo package.  This is the best razor I have ever used.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Schick quatro razors are my absolute favorite. I&#x27;ve used many different brands, but always end up coming back to schick. While more expensive, they provide a close shave with little to no razor burn. Worth the extra dough IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave the product four stars, because of price.</li>
            <li> I never considered razors to be tricky until I tried a Venus Embrace and absolutely hated it. The fancy strips at the top and bottom turned to slimy gunk after just one use rendering them useless leaving me with a mess. Those Venus razors were awful and they have a nearly perfect rating on Amazon. *sigh* These are really plain razors. No fancy strips or vibrating handles, but they work. The blades are sharp and if you use a nice soap the blade will last at least two weeks if not more. The package comes with three packs of refills and one razor with a blade attached. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Any girl knows, razors are expensive! I insist on sticking with Qattro&#x27;s, though. This is partly because they give a great close shave, but more because the razors last FOREVER. You can seriously use a single cartridge for a couple of weeks, at least. I&#x27;m guilty of going a month or more on one cartridge. They&#x27;re simply better quality than other brands. And with this package,  you get them for way cheaper than anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This was such an AMAZING deal! Still can not get over it! It arrived at my home only a few days after I had ordered it. I have been using this particular brand of razor for almost 10 years. The product is great, I have very sensitive legs and this is one of the few razors I can use. Much more expensive in the store. You must buy it! But please leave one for me to order again :-)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor, but now that I own it and have been using it  for a few months, I&#x27;m not so sure. Thought about giving it away a few times (with new blades of course) and moving on to something different. If you don&#x27;t have TONS of soap on your legs (I use Dove body wash), the razor will stick and the head will pop off. Not sure if my handle is just flimsy, but I lose the razor head while shaving at least 3 times during a typical session. Especially on my armpits and bikini line. I have to go over my armpits SO many times even though I shave them every day. Also note that the razors have that fine wire over them. I was unclear when I purchased these and only came across one review that had mentioned this. This would be a great starter set for a 12 year old with a giant can of shaving gel, but once I&#x27;m through these blades I&#x27;m switching to a Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li> This razor &amp; extra blades shipped quickly and for a good price.  I tried a five-blade razor, but because of the excessive movement of the blade angle I could not get a close shave, so I switched back to this tried and true product.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors and this deal was cheaper than any retailer I&#x27;ve seen. $31.99 for 12 razors is a great deal when they are quality.</li>
            <li> For far to long I spent money on cheap men&#x27;s disposable razors. Double blades usually. I would get maybe 1 or 2 shaves from those. I felt I was saving money using those DOLLAR STORE bargain razors. So I decided to take a chance on something a bit more pricy. And LADIE&#x27;S or MEN&#x27;S razors???? Is there really a difference? Have to say WOW WOW WOW! These are great. I have only used 1 so far and have gotten 6 shaves from JUST 1! I only shave 2 times a week. My line of work does not call for me to be clean shaven. So when I do shave I have about 5 days growth. So, 1 razor has lasted me about 1 month.  12 should last me a year. These are AWESOME! Smooth, comfortable and feel great in your hand. Guys... get&#x27;m!</li>
            <li> Razors and cartridges have become outrageous in price these days.  But this is a great value, and these will last me a long time.  This razor in particular is a great razor and the cartridges last a long time before having to be changed (at least they do for me!).  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor and came as advertised.  It is a very good deal and the quality is good.  I would order these again, but it will be awhile because they give you 12 cartridges!!!</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, not one of my absolute favorites, but they work pretty well, and it was cheaper than buying locally.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t give me the close shave I was looking for. It served its purpose but I&#x27;ll try another brand when I run out.</li>
            <li> Razors stay sharp a long time.  Handle is sturdy and easy to use especially around knees.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> deja la piel suave al momento del afeitado y no deja resequedad en las piernas. lo recomiendo y muy producto</li>
            <li> Great quality.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be real with you guys here. I&#x27;ve had the Quattro razor with the &amp;#34;bikini trimmer&amp;#34;, that trimmer I never ONCE used. My razor was unnecessarily bulky but I got the hang of it, and I&#x27;ve been using that Quattro razor for a very long time (something like 5 years). I like the cartridges; when money is tight, I&#x27;ve used the same cartridge for upwards of 2-3 months (maybe even more really) and I can still shave normally, no razor burn to speak of, and it still comes out smooth. These cartridges will last you a very long time if you want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the package I got was light orange, not fuchsia like the regular Quattro I have. This is probably because according to the package the cartridges are the &amp;#34;papaya infused&amp;#34; ones and I&#x27;m guessing they wanted the handle to match, it&#x27;s no big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I must stress is that you DO NOT go to town with the brand new razor, you WILL get razor burn in places you probably don&#x27;t want razor burn. I don&#x27;t know what it is about brand new cartridges but they&#x27;re always TOO sharp, and you must treat yourself and the razor very gently for a week or so, so the cartridge can maybe dull itself a little and not damage your skin. You should be very gentle the first  few times you shave with new cartridges, at least when it comes to the Quattro brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Quattro got crud (I don&#x27;t even want to know what it was) very easily because it was so old. As you can see from the pictures it&#x27;s been around, and it was time to change it (and also get new cartridges because I had been using that one for like 3 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that say that hairs &amp;#34;tangle&amp;#34; easily with this Quattro they most definitely DO but it&#x27;s so EASY to get them off. As someone who sheds an ungodly amount of hair, especially in the shower, you can bet that I &amp;#34;detangle&amp;#34; hair from my razor that was stuck to my legs every 5 seconds. All you have to do to remove it is run it under the shower head (or tap, whatever) and run your fingers WITH the razor (not against obviously unless you want to cut yourself) removing the hair. The hair literally just washes away and the razor is hair-free in seconds. It will not go away if you just wiggle the razor around the water and try to will the hairs off, they will not go unless you make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of cartridges (probably in like two years) I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).ap, whatever) and run your fingers WITH the razor (not against obviously unless you want to cut yourself) removing the hair. The hair literally just washes away and the razor is hair-free in seconds. It will not go away if you just wiggle the razor around the water and try to will the hairs off, they will not go unless you make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of cartridges (probably in like two years) I will be buying this again, because you&#x27;re better off buying this and getting the extra handle, than buying the individual cartridges at the store (or even online really).</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, just not the smoothest razor I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> My original razor lasted me around ten years and finally had to replace it. This wasn&#x27;t the dark pink razor like mine I was expecting, I got a limited edition one. Still love it. My favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the angle at which the blade cartridge sits on the handle - too vertical. Also, the handle has very in the way of grip and can be slippery. Also in fear of cutting myself if I should lose my grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a deal like this anywhere around here. Excellent razors and great price too. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> At Walmart, it&#x27;s $20 for 8 blades.  I paid $30 through Amazon and got a new razor, and 12 blades!  Will certainly buy again!!</li>
            <li> This razor cuts my faceâ€¦causes much blood. I end up using my husband&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> Instead of a single handle and three refill cartridges, it&#x27;s three separate starter packs of handles and blades. I purchase the bigger packs because I don&#x27;t need new handles, I&#x27;m trying to cut down on the plastic I&#x27;m using. But, whatever, it worked fine, it&#x27;s lasted me forever. I just don&#x27;t like being lied too in the product pictures.</li>
            <li> Best razor at great price!  I have super sensitive skin and these work great.</li>
