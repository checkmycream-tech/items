            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Their products are the best and do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>Great for exfoliating, but thought it was a cleanser also</li>
            <li>and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it feels so good on my skin</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I have rosacea, and this effectively cleans and exfoliates my skin without freaking it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it&#x27;s a very finely textured scrub.</li>
            <li>Added bonus is the nice fruity smell, easy to smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a bit more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely positively love this face wash</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser in the shower for washing my face and am truly satisfied with the usefulness and end result of the product.</li>
            <li>Looks like many people enjoy it...just not for me.</li>
            <li>This is a mild non-drying exfoliator that gives my skin a refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>I really like this, its an effective product.</li>
            <li>They are light and rinse well.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin clean and smooth but does not dehydrate it.</li>
            <li>Good facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this and really anything by Garnier company.  </li>
            <li>This face wash makes my skin feel fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I always feel like my face is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Garnier facial cleaners are fast becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li>The beads are soft and squishy so its not too intense on dead skin, but its a great deal for removing makeup and cleansing.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is really oily in certain areas, I decided to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>After just 3 days of use my skin is softer and my blackheads are VERY noticeably lessened.</li>
            <li>Cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>I like using scrubs to control my acne-prone (but also dry sometimes) skin, but this is so fine that it really doesn&#x27;t exfoliate like I expected.</li>
            <li>just too much grapefruit not enough pomegranate in the mix.</li>
            <li>I have VERY picky skin, it&#x27;s both dry</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not super excited about the fact that when I wash my hands to get this product off of them, that I&#x27;m left with a slightly oily residue on them.</li>

            <li> I really like this, its an effective product. I have VERY picky skin, it&#x27;s both dry and I have rosacea, and this effectively cleans and exfoliates my skin without freaking it out. Added bonus is the nice fruity smell, easy to smell, not overpowering. My skin feels softer after using it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare fiend. This is a mild non-drying exfoliator that gives my skin a refreshing feel. I always recommend something with grapefruit to wake up to, I actually feel like it gives you a boost. The beads are soft and squishy so its not too intense on dead skin, but its a great deal for removing makeup and cleansing.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating, but thought it was a cleanser also</li>
            <li> Used this mask twice already and I love it. It leaves skin clean and smooth but does not dehydrate it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the reviews. I was hoping for something a bit more exfoliating. There are not very many scrubbing beads in the cleanser. I didn&#x27;t care for the scent...just too much grapefruit not enough pomegranate in the mix. Looks like many people enjoy it...just not for me.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied. After washing my face with it I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was refreshed and after using it for 2 weeks daily, my face broke out and it&#x27;s the worse it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Like the product and the smell. I feel it does the job. No problem w/ dryness or the product sticking to my hair.</li>
            <li> Good facial cleanser and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s a very finely textured scrub. I like using scrubs to control my acne-prone (but also dry sometimes) skin, but this is so fine that it really doesn&#x27;t exfoliate like I expected. This product claims it&#x27;s for combination skin, but it also doesn&#x27;t contain any acne medications (like salicylic acid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again because it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. (I prefer the Neutrogena grapefruit scrub.)</li>
            <li> This face wash makes my skin feel fresh &amp; clean. Also, I feel like it helps my face be less greasy throughout the day.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely positively love this face wash it feels so good on my skin I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> we normally use the other version, the green one, which is abit minty. thought i would give this one a try. i don&#x27;t see big difference other than the smell. i like it. But Hubby prefer the green one due to the slight cool feeling after the wash.</li>
            <li> After just 3 days of use my skin is softer and my blackheads are VERY noticeably lessened. I love the smell and texture. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  Cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> Garnier facial cleaners are fast becoming my favorite. They are light and rinse well. I always feel like my face is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s indeed balancing but you must also use a moisturizer with it because it causes some dryness. I do recommend for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Love this and really anything by Garnier company.  Their products are the best and do what they advertise.  I use this cleanser in the shower for washing my face and am truly satisfied with the usefulness and end result of the product.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is really oily in certain areas, I decided to buy this product. I noticed immediate results. My skin was lighter and once I dried it with a towel, I could feel smoothness without any oil residues on my hand. Since I wear a lot of make up, this product has helped me control my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does what it says it will... but I&#x27;m not super excited about the fact that when I wash my hands to get this product off of them, that I&#x27;m left with a slightly oily residue on them. Other than that, I love the smell, and the consistency but am pretty disappointed about the oily feel it leaves my hands and my face.</li>
