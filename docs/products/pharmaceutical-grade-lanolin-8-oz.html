            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product provided amazing results and cleared up his skin unlike any product or medication he has ever used.</li>
            <li>I used this to make my own salve.  </li>
            <li>No reaction of any kind.</li>
            <li>If you are hoping to mix it in lotions or potions this lanolin has a kind of alcohol smell to it.</li>
            <li>Some lanolin products don&#x27;t have a good smell, but this one is fine.</li>
            <li>This stuff is WONDERFUL, every bit as nice as the much more costly stuff, soaks in in no time, unlike the lanolin butter that stays greasy forever and totally scentless.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, use it every day.</li>
            <li>Prefer it to the more liquid form.  </li>
            <li>Two drops of olive oil along with a tiny amount of the lanolin made it perfect for my face, hands, and arms.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>so well I am purchasing 2 more containers.</li>
            <li>Most emollient stuff I&#x27;ve ever used in my life-</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Again, this is a phenomenal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using lanolin for many years now, and it&#x27;s been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li>This product lives up to its name as pharmaceutical grade as many companies who advertise &amp;#34;pure lanolin&amp;#34; tend to have additives and fillers which irritate my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, very good for moisturizing and protecting dry and cracked skin</li>
            <li>and I really like supporting this company as they have excellent customer service!</li>
            <li>Great product, very creamy and easy to apply, put it on your cracked heels, wrap with saran wrap, put on a pair of socks and let the lanolin do</li>
            <li>like it, it work good with the other oils i mix with it.it great for someone have skin problems</li>
            <li>so it worked great for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>very nice leaves skin so soft</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and to apply.</li>
            <li>but my wife who is very picky about this kind of thing has given her hearty endorsement.  </li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I bought the pricey Australian stuff and loved it, started using it on my cuticles then learned, yes learned how to use it as a hand cream.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it works really well</li>
            <li>I was use to the popular tube product which is super soft in comparison.</li>
            <li>takes time to work around and it super, duper greasy-</li>
            <li>For the short period I used it, my skin felt very moisturized and it looks great as a lip gloss</li>
            <li>However, it is ideal for protecting sensitive dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Does not weigh my fine curls down, leaves amazing sheen and manageability.</li>
            <li>Great for taming curly hair (rub between fingers and then lightly run fingers through hair), for hands and cuticles (put on at night, wear cotton or thin vinyl gloves, wake up to softness), and even for lips.  </li>
            <li>It has a very slight but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Huge plus is that it is natural lanolin . . .</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying lanolin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I gave lanolin a second chance after the first time was so stinky.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably what makes it work so well, but it will feel funny against your sheets if you&#x27;re sleeping with it on.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It smells great, but really, wearing this sticky stuff for any amount of time is not nice.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it is greasy and takes a long while to soak in, but it&#x27;s excellent on my dry eczema hands plagued by alcohol hand sanitizer at work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to make lip balm and this stuff will work very well for that.</li>
            <li>I started going through it fast</li>
            <li>I did find it so very dense, that I had to find something on hand to make it appliable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy, though...</li>
            <li>This is so much better than other lanolin products out there.  </li>
            <li>lanolin is probably the thickest I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s ideal for rubbing onto my very dry feet and wearing thick socks to bed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by all the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it in a few of my recipes and have enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li>To hard to use, I thought it would be softer and more useable.</li>
            <li>, Now, very stinky, I have two cats that would leave the bedroom when I open the jar</li>
            <li>Non-greasy sealant for natural hair.</li>
            <li>and this is the same product but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Lanolin is thick and stinky (as in overly earthy), which I discovered many years ago.</li>
            <li>This is equal or better [without a chemical analysis hard to know]</li>
            <li>No other additives.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a general moisturizer before bed (face, elbows, feet, etc).</li>
            <li>My manicurist was surprised at my last pedicure!</li>
            <li>Apparently odor was a problem with some other pure lanolin products.  </li>
            <li>(I live in the Northeast USA) and rub this into the dry patches.  </li>

            <li> (I live in the Northeast USA) and rub this into the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin due to contact dermatitis which has progressively worsened over the years.</li>
            <li> A little too thick &amp; sticky to easily apply.</li>
            <li> at first I didn&#x27;t know if I could even use it because it was so hard</li>
            <li> It clears up my dry skin rash in no time as long as it is given enough time to soak in.  </li>
            <li> If you are nursing, this would be fine to use for cracked nipples, and much less expensive than the brand you get in the drug store that comes in tiny tubes.</li>
            <li> the dry spots GONE.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been as dry as this winter</li>
            <li> Consistency is a little odd, sort of like soft taffy, but it liquefies when warmed.  </li>
            <li> and my lips are very dry.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews from other consumers, I opted for this product because it was said to have no odor.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not nauseating and it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I sat down to Amazon and bought 5 jars of lanolin, creamed and mixes.  </li>
            <li> That basically means that as soon as I put it on, little bumps appear on my lips and skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin easily, not waxy.  </li>
            <li> During the winter my sinuses get dried out and this helps heal the sores which NOTHING else does!  </li>
            <li> If you have tried other products - you know what I mean!  </li>
            <li> I discovered lanolin a couple years ago when a 44 year old split lip developed a constraint flake that resulted in me chewing it all night and horrible inter lip sores.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t ever use this lanolin, as its just too hard to get out of the jar.</li>
            <li> This stuff if thick, hard, greasy, it takes some getting use to.  </li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> will say though that it is sticky, almost like a thick, tacky paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and goopie but it works, I put it on my husbands feet</li>
            <li> I used the Birch box lanolin but it expensive</li>
            <li> weird smell-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot use it because my skin says no.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I bought some other brand of lanolin and it smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad who suffers from psoriasis and has for 50 years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used it in a few of my recipes and have enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> Great product, very creamy and easy to apply, put it on your cracked heels, wrap with saran wrap, put on a pair of socks and let the lanolin do it&#x27;s work while you sleep. Works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, use it every day. Prefer it to the more liquid form.  I use it with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t ever use this lanolin, as its just too hard to get out of the jar. I was use to the popular tube product which is super soft in comparison. I&#x27;m really surprised by all the positive reviews for this product. How does anyone use it?</li>
            <li> A little too thick &amp; sticky to easily apply. However my skin loves it and shows it.</li>
            <li> Eliminates so many beauty products!  Great for taming curly hair (rub between fingers and then lightly run fingers through hair), for hands and cuticles (put on at night, wear cotton or thin vinyl gloves, wake up to softness), and even for lips.  Consistency is a little odd, sort of like soft taffy, but it liquefies when warmed.  Huge plus is that it is natural lanolin . . . period!  No other additives.  Lasts a long time (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I bought some other brand of lanolin and it smelled awful.  Smelled like chemicals. It was my first time buying lanolin.  I didn&#x27;t know what it was supposed to smell like, but I knew I could not put that stuff on my body.  This product is pharmaceutical grade and it shows.  No scent or odor.  It goes on the skin easily, not waxy.  &amp;#34;Melts&amp;#34; into your skin and stays there.  It&#x27;s not sticky.  Of course it&#x27;s shiny until it absorbs.  I bought this to make lip balm and this stuff will work very well for that. I&#x27;m so pleased I gave lanolin a second chance after the first time was so stinky.  This one is great.  No odor means happy lips. (and nose)</li>
            <li> Too thick. Going to try heating it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My beard loves it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase of this product. I was nervous as I had read reviews stating there was a smell with this product. I found there to be no smell and feel it is providing the qualities it has been described. I am happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference with prolonged moisture for my chapped lips, no diff to using anything else just stickier.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own salve.  Worked great!</li>
            <li> I use this as a general moisturizer before bed (face, elbows, feet, etc). I also use it as a lip moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing. I go to bed with it on and I wake up with the dry spots GONE. No greasy, oily residue left over in morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that it is sticky, almost like a thick, tacky paste. That&#x27;s probably what makes it work so well, but it will feel funny against your sheets if you&#x27;re sleeping with it on. SOme people will say cover it with something while you sleep (a towel, socks, gloves, etc.) but I dont</li>
            <li> This is a great product for heavy-duty moisturizing. I use it on my feet and hands. It has a very slight but pleasant scent. Some lanolin products don&#x27;t have a good smell, but this one is fine. It&#x27;s a great buy. If you are nursing, this would be fine to use for cracked nipples, and much less expensive than the brand you get in the drug store that comes in tiny tubes. It&#x27;s pharmaceutical grade. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, very good for moisturizing and protecting dry and cracked skin</li>
            <li> like it, it work good with the other oils i mix with it.it great for someone have skin problems</li>
            <li> Great Quality - we recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I discovered lanolin a couple years ago when a 44 year old split lip developed a constraint flake that resulted in me chewing it all night and horrible inter lip sores.  I bought the pricey Australian stuff and loved it, started using it on my cuticles then learned, yes learned how to use it as a hand cream.  This stuff if thick, hard, greasy, it takes some getting use to.  I started going through it fast so I bought a cheaper product, Now, very stinky, I have two cats that would leave the bedroom when I open the jar and my hubby wished he could.  I sat down to Amazon and bought 5 jars of lanolin, creamed and mixes.  This stuff is WONDERFUL, every bit as nice as the much more costly stuff, soaks in in no time, unlike the lanolin butter that stays greasy forever and totally scentless.  I have found my holy grail of hand, lip  and foot softener and will be back</li>
            <li> Lanolin is thick and stinky (as in overly earthy), which I discovered many years ago. However, it is ideal for protecting sensitive dry skin.  For those who don&#x27;t know, lanolin is a by-product of the sheep-shearing process and sheep aren&#x27;t harmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lanolin is probably the thickest I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s ideal for rubbing onto my very dry feet and wearing thick socks to bed.  My manicurist was surprised at my last pedicure!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews from other consumers, I opted for this product because it was said to have no odor.  Apparently odor was a problem with some other pure lanolin products.  I did find it so very dense, that I had to find something on hand to make it appliable.  I decided to try olive oil. Two drops of olive oil along with a tiny amount of the lanolin made it perfect for my face, hands, and arms. At some point, I plan to buy some mink oil to replace the olive oil.  I&#x27;m delighted with the effect it is having on my skin!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a LONG way. Non-greasy sealant for natural hair. Does not weigh my fine curls down, leaves amazing sheen and manageability. Cannot do without this product!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I found it when I was searching for a cheaper lanolin product. I used the Birch box lanolin but it expensive and this is the same product but much cheaper. This product is great for chapped lips and to moisturize cuticles, I use it every night. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very nice leaves skin so soft</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s thick and goopie but it works, I put it on my husbands feet and it made a big difference.</li>
            <li> Love it so well I am purchasing 2 more containers.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but really, wearing this sticky stuff for any amount of time is not nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product, not greasy- will be perfect in the lip balm I&#x27;m making and I really like supporting this company as they have excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Most emollient stuff I&#x27;ve ever used in my life- at first I didn&#x27;t know if I could even use it because it was so hard but if it gets heated up it will spread- takes time to work around and it super, duper greasy- but if you are using this for eczema, this will save your life- no weird smell- I don&#x27;t have a sheep allergy so it worked great for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  It is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only downfall is that it is greasy and takes a long while to soak in, but it&#x27;s excellent on my dry eczema hands plagued by alcohol hand sanitizer at work.  It clears up my dry skin rash in no time as long as it is given enough time to soak in.  However, if it gets on clothing it has to be scrubbed out with dawn; it won&#x27;t just wash out in the regular laundry.  Again, this is a phenomenal moisturizer.  I used it without problems when breastfeeding too.</li>
            <li> Love this product excellent for very dry skin great customer service!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad who suffers from psoriasis and has for 50 years. This product provided amazing results and cleared up his skin unlike any product or medication he has ever used. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Gave me contact dermatitis. That basically means that as soon as I put it on, little bumps appear on my lips and skin. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m allergic to this stuff, it&#x27;s an incredible product. Unfortunately, I cannot use it because my skin says no. For the short period I used it, my skin felt very moisturized and it looks great as a lip gloss (but you gotta mix it with oil in the microwave/stovetop or else your lips will turn white using only the lanolin). I&#x27;m giving it 5 starts because I think it&#x27;s a great product. The smell is not nauseating and it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. It&#x27;s just unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s very greasy, though...</li>
            <li> This is so much better than other lanolin products out there.  It virtually has no smell.  If you have tried other products - you know what I mean!  During the winter my sinuses get dried out and this helps heal the sores which NOTHING else does!  This is one generous tub of lanolin.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellent product just what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lanolin for many years now, and it&#x27;s been a life saver for me. I have extremely sensitive skin due to contact dermatitis which has progressively worsened over the years. After finding lanolin not only does it not irritate my skin in any way it also makes my skin feel smoother than any product I&#x27;ve ever used before. This product lives up to its name as pharmaceutical grade as many companies who advertise &amp;#34;pure lanolin&amp;#34; tend to have additives and fillers which irritate my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> the best moisturizer ever...</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the winter that never ends!  My skin has never been as dry as this winter (I live in the Northeast USA) and rub this into the dry patches.  Goes away overnight.</li>
            <li> Like this grade of lanolin.  Not smelly.</li>
            <li> Like the big jar, also.</li>
            <li> I love it and it works really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything and my lips are very dry. This product is a miracle! No reaction of any kind. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted.  Easy to mix and to apply.</li>
            <li> very nice, great product and value</li>
            <li> I had purchased the smaller 2oz tubs from another vendor for several years before they were on Amazon.  This is equal or better [without a chemical analysis hard to know] but my wife who is very picky about this kind of thing has given her hearty endorsement.  The double grade rating indicates quality and there is no essence.  It goes on perfectly smoothly.  She gives two thumbs up. ;-)</li>
            <li> To hard to use, I thought it would be softer and more useable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good.  If you are hoping to mix it in lotions or potions this lanolin has a kind of alcohol smell to it.</li>
