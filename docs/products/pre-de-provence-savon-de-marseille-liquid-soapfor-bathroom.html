    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The scents are the perfect strength.  </li>
            <li>but this is the perfect consistency.  </li>
            <li>My best friend tried it and she will be switching from Bath and Body Works soaps to this.  </li>
            <li>This liquid soap from Pre de Provence is an excellent choice for  use for oneself and others in one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is obviously an excellent product though.</li>
            <li>a sage-scented hand soap from France is the best of both</li>
            <li>The best part is that when you’re done your hands smell just like this</li>
            <li>this soap was ideal for me.</li>
            <li>The packaging is beautiful making it a decorative and function piece.  </li>
            <li>Great scent (not overpowering)</li>
            <li>It is an attractive bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is not an uncommon situation.</li>
            <li>But...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>This stuff  smells great</li>
            <li>It also has a great consistency.</li>
            <li>But then again, it’s got great indegrients, and it’s imported from France.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap!!  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks very nice and it is a good soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap has a pleasant scent and a pleasant feel.</li>
            <li>The soap has a strong, wonderful smell</li>
            <li>This is good and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a good sized plastic bottle of soap with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself smells good.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price of this soap is quite spendy, so it&#x27;s not something I would buy a lot of, but it would make a great gift, and like I mentioned, it is great for a guest bath, to make your guests feel special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but not THAT nice.</li>
            <li>It looks nice is the bathroom and is made in France.</li>
            <li>Nice feature:</li>
            <li>Nice feature:</li>
            <li>The soap is nice.</li>
            <li>I make my own body oils and hair oil with olive oil and lavender from my garden.  </li>
            <li>soap feels so nice</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>My mother and I both found the scent to be very nice, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is a good thing, considering it is pretty</li>
            <li>The liquid is the perfect thickness and allows you to quickly and easily clean your hands.  </li>
            <li>And it leaves a lingering aroma along the lines of your better kind of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but with the bright fresh herby smell of sage too!</li>
            <li>Not only is the smell great, it works great too.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing... not too strong like some lavender soaps.  </li>
            <li>This is a  nice strong lavender-scented soap that doesn&#x27;t linger after use.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin with lots of foam, and is easy to rinse off unlike some soaps that leave a lingering slipperiness.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent is lavender.  </li>
            <li>so I can say it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>have this in my powder room, and it does seem more elegant (in sight and scent) than a supermarket brand of liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>The label is stylish as well as the silver/black pump.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely soap.</li>
            <li>so it does not make many suds.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a soap that I will gladly leave out when I have guests.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say I didn&#x27;t love this from the get go....</li>
            <li>It comes in a pump bottle made of plastic with an appealing old-fashioned looking label.</li>
            <li>but I think the manufacturer needs to come up with a better lid/stopper/pump arrangement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaging of this soap also LOOKS lovely sitting by the sink.</li>
            <li>still love love</li>
            <li>it love it...</li>
            <li>It is strong so those who do not like strong fragrances may not want to use this kind of soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, as others have pointed out, the aroma is strong and MUCH more like Sage than like Lavender, I did not find this an issue.</li>
            <li>The liquid feels a bit slippery going on, but it washes off fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong on the lavender</li>
            <li>fragrance is strong when you apply it, but the scent is pleasing.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a stronger scent this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li>It pumps well, though kind of loose with a good amount of soap coming out.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice, large size.</li>
            <li>It pumps easily from the original bottle (or any pump bottle you may choose to use).  </li>
            <li>The kids like it, guest enjoy it, but no one has gone out of their way to ask or inquire as to the soap.  </li>
            <li>It also was not tested on animals if that is important to you.  </li>
            <li>I probably would not purchase but will enjoy it until I finish it up.  </li>
            <li>price is a bit steep, and I wish it hadn’t leaked in transit, but if you like rich-smelling hand soap, you’ll probably enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>First and foremost the product arrived leaking with the top not secured to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>So even though I don&#x27;t normally like heavily-scented products, I kind of like this one.  </li>
            <li>Besides smelling great, it goes a really long way.</li>
            <li>But the price point makes it special occasion soap.</li>
            <li>But this is nice to have for times when a little more elegant alternative seems warranted.</li>
            <li>Every person is different as far as what scents they find attractive, so someone else might just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of lavender and this soap, with the hint of sage, fills the shower with the scent...like a whole field of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>enough to make a good lather but not be wasteful.</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is good enough.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit much for everyday use, but as a gift or in your own bathroom as a special treat, it is very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s labeled sage and lavender, but the sage is so strongly scented that I can&#x27;t smell very much lavender at all.  </li>
            <li>But the residue is not unpleasant and my hands do feel clean after washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of nice to act as a little mini perfume in a way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not antibacterial, it&#x27;s just mild handsoap without parabens and is vegetable based.</li>
            <li>One pump puts 1/2 teaspoon of this mildly fragrant soap in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>-- super lavendar-y, of course,</li>
            <li>It washes up well, cleaning quickly and thoroughly, and then rinses quickly and without a slippery residue.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it three stars mostly because of the high price</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is, by no means, a &#x27;bargain&#x27; item - but one that can be a welcome compliment to the most private of rooms where we may tend to pamper ourselves, in very personal ways.</li>
            <li>It does have a lovely, very natural lavender scent, not synthetic perfume smell that will stay on your hands if you put your nose to it.</li>
            <li>It does not linger on the hand though, especially because after you rinse your hands, the strong scent mostly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I’m a big, hairy man, but I’m secure enough to state that this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>It clings nicely for the hand wash and smells like a French countryside.  </li>
            <li>This lavender-scented liquid soap has a powerful, perfumey scent.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s got to be worth something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is worth getting for all the areas in your home</li>
            <li>It’s a bit spendy, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product has a medium-light floral scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it does fade pretty quickly so you won&#x27;t be wandering around and smelling like flowers all day.</li>
            <li>will state however that this doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing, because after using my hands are squeaky Tupperware clean.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase it at the going price, but as far as the quality I think it is good, though a different scent, maybe something a bit lighter or more citrusy might be a little better.  </li>
            <li>; B002UW41WY (much cheaper in store) that I use that is mostly all natural &amp;</li>
            <li>Coconut oil has emerged in recent years as a powerful substance for healthy skin care.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of some lavender cologne I used to have as a kid -- I like it very much.</li>
            <li>be aware if you wear cologne.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer Mrs. Myer&#x27;s liquid soaps and fragrances better.  </li>
            <li>Today&#x27;s marketplace is making the simple task of washing one&#x27;s hands interesting....</li>
            <li>I have been using various types of liquid-pump hand soap in my home for many years.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy some more of it when the current container runs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect such soaps to be pricier than the grocery store stuff for sure...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was a bit overpowering to me at first, but after a bit of use</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite pretty and mine arrived intact with nothing leaking.</li>
            <li>After using this liquid soap from Pre de Provence for a week or so, I am pleased (and somewhat surprised) to say that I have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>The soap does not dry and leaves your hands feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the average person would be able to afford this kind of soap to use on a daily basis and that fact that lavender just doesn&#x27;t seem to go well with hand soap.</li>
            <li>It works well and smells wonderful - the lavender is real and does not have a fake perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surely a fine choice for the sensitive skin on the hands, particularly on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the overall scent is pretty strong so while it is usable for me I prefer a softer scent.</li>
            <li>My family has enjoyed using liquid soaps in our house for a long time</li>
            <li>I like a mild lavender scent for things to put around the house, but it can be a strong scent, and I did not really like it on this soap.  </li>
            <li>has a strong scent that fills the room when you first open it, then dissipates fast.</li>
            <li>The lather is just right, and the consistency seems a bit thinner than many other liquid soaps, which I found appealing.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is reduced to a mild suggestive-scent after rinsing the hands off with clear water - and don&#x27;t we all do that?</li>
            <li>That is to say that I found that using a few drops is more than adequate for routine hand washing.</li>
            <li>However, the price for a bottle seems very high to me.  </li>
            <li>problem is that the price is very high.  </li>
            <li>The label says it is made with natural vegetable oils with no artificial coloring.  </li>
            <li>home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I agree with others that it&#x27;s much heavier on the sage than the lavender.</li>
            <li>$20 seems steep, especially for something that&#x27;s got a host of synthetic ingredients I associate with cheap grocery store</li>
            <li>This is not knockoff soap; this is the real deal, and you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This is a very luxurious, maybe even decadent, product.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feel soft and moisturized right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The scent is powerful but pleasant and it didn&#x27;t dry my hands out like the antibacterial soap (from other brands) frequently does.</li>
            <li>We put it in place of our normal soap in the guest bathroom and have had a few guests mention how they liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li>The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@</li>
            <li>The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@</li>
            <li>You can get soap that is just as good with all of the above benefits for slightly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>, plastic black arm pump top.</li>
            <li>reason I took of two stars was that for the 20 dollars a bottle it charges, I expected mostly all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>container to last for many months of daily use by two people.</li>
            <li>Whenever you do use it you can smell it pretty potently in the bathroom for a little bit after each dispense action.</li>
            <li>This can help make up for the high price.</li>
            <li>The price is high - some would say exorbitant.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t create a massive amount of lather, but my hands do feel clean and not dried out after using</li>
            <li>It left my hands feeling soft, and clean, not at all</li>
            <li>The scent is natural, not cloying or too intense.</li>
            <li>If you look at it that way, the value isn’t really that far out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other hand, it is wildly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it for myself because it&#x27;s not important enough in my hedonic calculus; however, if I had a friend who loved this sort of thing it would make a lovely present.</li>
            <li>Unlike most liquid soaps we use, it feels a little oily in that it doesn&#x27;t wash off completely.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product, a little pricey though in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The product packaging isn&#x27;t high end enough to justify the much higher cost.</li>
            <li>It is almost a little too much at first but the scent quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>I only use a single (whole) pump when washing my hands, and that is more than enough.</li>
            <li>This is a fine hand soap with a slight clove smell which I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the only downside is that the bottle is plastic and the price is pretty hefty for soap.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a hint of lavender, a bit of citronella, and a light bass note of sage---barely discernible.</li>
            <li>after several weeks of using this nearly every day, it does not seem that the level in the bottle has dropped very much.</li>
            <li>also leaves them feeling silky soft, smooth, and smelling slightly</li>
            <li>As a frequent hand washer who loves the scent of lavender</li>
            <li>(She is a Francophile and uses natural cleaning options, so</li>
            <li>fragrance), Benzyl Benzoate (solvent &amp; preservative, can cause dermatitis), Geraniol (natural plant oil), Limonene (natural fragrance), Citronellol (natural plant oil), Farnesol (natural or synthetic fragrance), Citral (natural or synthetic plant oil), Coumarin (can be a natural or synthetic fragrance).</li>
            <li>Up until now, my favorite was an organic one that sometimes jels up at the end of the spout because, I think, the soap is a bit too viscous (thick) for the size of the dispensing pump.</li>
            <li>When this soap arrived, the box was highly aromatic as the seal was loose between the bottle and the dispenser top, and a small amount of the liquid had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it seems that this item is above the normal price scale for like products</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good quality soap, made with natural vegetable oils, glycerin and coconut oil which naturally moisturizes skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors or animal testing.</li>
            <li>in France (the specific area is not identified: The name suggests Provence, but what&#x27;s in a name?), this soap is less thick and flows smoothly and easily through the pump.</li>
            <li>It is almost a bit watery, not thick, rinsing off with barely any attempt, with no extra reside.</li>
            <li>I found the soap to be fairly thick and have quite a strong lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>The entire package smelled of hand soap and it made a mess to clean up and remove from the box.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little to clean your hands, so the bottle lasts for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smell only while washing with it; it rinses away completely.  </li>
            <li>/ 500 ml thin plastic bottle with a stylish silver colored bottom</li>
            <li>Our family of three has already gone through about half of this bottle, which means for more than a month this single (roughly) 17-ounce bottle will wash bathroom hands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the soap is less thick than many others, it is not less functional.</li>
            <li>Perhaps in this case, squeaky clean is not a good thing for the hands.</li>
            <li>I found it gentle on my hands, the pump worked well, and as mentioned before, you only need to use a little bit.</li>

            <li> The scents are the perfect strength.  </li>

            <li> My mother and I both found the scent to be very nice, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is a good thing, considering it is pretty</li>
            <li> The liquid is the perfect thickness and allows you to quickly and easily clean your hands.  </li>
            <li> And it leaves a lingering aroma along the lines of your better kind of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but with the bright fresh herby smell of sage too!</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell great, it works great too.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing... not too strong like some lavender soaps.  </li>
            <li> This is a  nice strong lavender-scented soap that doesn&#x27;t linger after use.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin with lots of foam, and is easy to rinse off unlike some soaps that leave a lingering slipperiness.  </li>
            <li> My favorite scent is lavender.  </li>
            <li> so I can say it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> have this in my powder room, and it does seem more elegant (in sight and scent) than a supermarket brand of liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> The label is stylish as well as the silver/black pump.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely soap.</li>
            <li> so it does not make many suds.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a soap that I will gladly leave out when I have guests.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say I didn&#x27;t love this from the get go....</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump bottle made of plastic with an appealing old-fashioned looking label.</li>
            <li> but I think the manufacturer needs to come up with a better lid/stopper/pump arrangement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging of this soap also LOOKS lovely sitting by the sink.</li>
            <li> still love love</li>
            <li> it love it...</li>
            <li> It is strong so those who do not like strong fragrances may not want to use this kind of soap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, as others have pointed out, the aroma is strong and MUCH more like Sage than like Lavender, I did not find this an issue.</li>
            <li> The liquid feels a bit slippery going on, but it washes off fairly easily.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong on the lavender</li>
            <li> fragrance is strong when you apply it, but the scent is pleasing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a stronger scent this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li> It pumps well, though kind of loose with a good amount of soap coming out.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice, large size.</li>
            <li> It pumps easily from the original bottle (or any pump bottle you may choose to use).  </li>
            <li> The kids like it, guest enjoy it, but no one has gone out of their way to ask or inquire as to the soap.  </li>
            <li> It also was not tested on animals if that is important to you.  </li>
            <li> I probably would not purchase but will enjoy it until I finish it up.  </li>
            <li> price is a bit steep, and I wish it hadn’t leaked in transit, but if you like rich-smelling hand soap, you’ll probably enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> First and foremost the product arrived leaking with the top not secured to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> So even though I don&#x27;t normally like heavily-scented products, I kind of like this one.  </li>
            <li> Besides smelling great, it goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> But the price point makes it special occasion soap.</li>
            <li> But this is nice to have for times when a little more elegant alternative seems warranted.</li>
            <li> Every person is different as far as what scents they find attractive, so someone else might just love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender and this soap, with the hint of sage, fills the shower with the scent...like a whole field of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> enough to make a good lather but not be wasteful.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is good enough.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit much for everyday use, but as a gift or in your own bathroom as a special treat, it is very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s labeled sage and lavender, but the sage is so strongly scented that I can&#x27;t smell very much lavender at all.  </li>
            <li> But the residue is not unpleasant and my hands do feel clean after washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of nice to act as a little mini perfume in a way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not antibacterial, it&#x27;s just mild handsoap without parabens and is vegetable based.</li>
            <li> One pump puts 1/2 teaspoon of this mildly fragrant soap in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> -- super lavendar-y, of course,</li>
            <li> It washes up well, cleaning quickly and thoroughly, and then rinses quickly and without a slippery residue.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars mostly because of the high price</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is, by no means, a &#x27;bargain&#x27; item - but one that can be a welcome compliment to the most private of rooms where we may tend to pamper ourselves, in very personal ways.</li>
            <li> It does have a lovely, very natural lavender scent, not synthetic perfume smell that will stay on your hands if you put your nose to it.</li>
            <li> It does not linger on the hand though, especially because after you rinse your hands, the strong scent mostly goes away.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a big, hairy man, but I’m secure enough to state that this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> It clings nicely for the hand wash and smells like a French countryside.  </li>
            <li> This lavender-scented liquid soap has a powerful, perfumey scent.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s got to be worth something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is worth getting for all the areas in your home</li>
            <li> It’s a bit spendy, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product has a medium-light floral scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it does fade pretty quickly so you won&#x27;t be wandering around and smelling like flowers all day.</li>
            <li> will state however that this doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing, because after using my hands are squeaky Tupperware clean.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase it at the going price, but as far as the quality I think it is good, though a different scent, maybe something a bit lighter or more citrusy might be a little better.  </li>
            <li> ; B002UW41WY (much cheaper in store) that I use that is mostly all natural &amp;</li>
            <li> Coconut oil has emerged in recent years as a powerful substance for healthy skin care.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of some lavender cologne I used to have as a kid -- I like it very much.</li>
            <li> be aware if you wear cologne.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer Mrs. Myer&#x27;s liquid soaps and fragrances better.  </li>
            <li> Today&#x27;s marketplace is making the simple task of washing one&#x27;s hands interesting....</li>
            <li> I have been using various types of liquid-pump hand soap in my home for many years.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy some more of it when the current container runs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect such soaps to be pricier than the grocery store stuff for sure...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent was a bit overpowering to me at first, but after a bit of use</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite pretty and mine arrived intact with nothing leaking.</li>
            <li> After using this liquid soap from Pre de Provence for a week or so, I am pleased (and somewhat surprised) to say that I have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> The soap does not dry and leaves your hands feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the average person would be able to afford this kind of soap to use on a daily basis and that fact that lavender just doesn&#x27;t seem to go well with hand soap.</li>
            <li> It works well and smells wonderful - the lavender is real and does not have a fake perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surely a fine choice for the sensitive skin on the hands, particularly on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the overall scent is pretty strong so while it is usable for me I prefer a softer scent.</li>
            <li> My family has enjoyed using liquid soaps in our house for a long time</li>
            <li> I like a mild lavender scent for things to put around the house, but it can be a strong scent, and I did not really like it on this soap.  </li>
            <li> has a strong scent that fills the room when you first open it, then dissipates fast.</li>
            <li> The lather is just right, and the consistency seems a bit thinner than many other liquid soaps, which I found appealing.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is reduced to a mild suggestive-scent after rinsing the hands off with clear water - and don&#x27;t we all do that?</li>
            <li> That is to say that I found that using a few drops is more than adequate for routine hand washing.</li>
            <li> However, the price for a bottle seems very high to me.  </li>
            <li> problem is that the price is very high.  </li>
            <li> The label says it is made with natural vegetable oils with no artificial coloring.  </li>
            <li> home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I agree with others that it&#x27;s much heavier on the sage than the lavender.</li>
            <li> $20 seems steep, especially for something that&#x27;s got a host of synthetic ingredients I associate with cheap grocery store</li>
            <li> This is not knockoff soap; this is the real deal, and you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This is a very luxurious, maybe even decadent, product.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feel soft and moisturized right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The scent is powerful but pleasant and it didn&#x27;t dry my hands out like the antibacterial soap (from other brands) frequently does.</li>
            <li> We put it in place of our normal soap in the guest bathroom and have had a few guests mention how they liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@</li>
            <li> The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@</li>
            <li> You can get soap that is just as good with all of the above benefits for slightly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> , plastic black arm pump top.</li>
            <li> reason I took of two stars was that for the 20 dollars a bottle it charges, I expected mostly all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> container to last for many months of daily use by two people.</li>
            <li> Whenever you do use it you can smell it pretty potently in the bathroom for a little bit after each dispense action.</li>
            <li> This can help make up for the high price.</li>
            <li> The price is high - some would say exorbitant.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t create a massive amount of lather, but my hands do feel clean and not dried out after using</li>
            <li> It left my hands feeling soft, and clean, not at all</li>
            <li> The scent is natural, not cloying or too intense.</li>
            <li> If you look at it that way, the value isn’t really that far out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other hand, it is wildly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it for myself because it&#x27;s not important enough in my hedonic calculus; however, if I had a friend who loved this sort of thing it would make a lovely present.</li>
            <li> Unlike most liquid soaps we use, it feels a little oily in that it doesn&#x27;t wash off completely.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product, a little pricey though in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The product packaging isn&#x27;t high end enough to justify the much higher cost.</li>
            <li> It is almost a little too much at first but the scent quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> I only use a single (whole) pump when washing my hands, and that is more than enough.</li>
            <li> This is a fine hand soap with a slight clove smell which I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the only downside is that the bottle is plastic and the price is pretty hefty for soap.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hint of lavender, a bit of citronella, and a light bass note of sage---barely discernible.</li>
            <li> after several weeks of using this nearly every day, it does not seem that the level in the bottle has dropped very much.</li>
            <li> also leaves them feeling silky soft, smooth, and smelling slightly</li>
            <li> As a frequent hand washer who loves the scent of lavender</li>

            <li> fragrance), Benzyl Benzoate (solvent &amp; preservative, can cause dermatitis), Geraniol (natural plant oil), Limonene (natural fragrance), Citronellol (natural plant oil), Farnesol (natural or synthetic fragrance), Citral (natural or synthetic plant oil), Coumarin (can be a natural or synthetic fragrance).</li>
            <li> Up until now, my favorite was an organic one that sometimes jels up at the end of the spout because, I think, the soap is a bit too viscous (thick) for the size of the dispensing pump.</li>
            <li> When this soap arrived, the box was highly aromatic as the seal was loose between the bottle and the dispenser top, and a small amount of the liquid had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it seems that this item is above the normal price scale for like products</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is good quality soap, made with natural vegetable oils, glycerin and coconut oil which naturally moisturizes skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors or animal testing.</li>
            <li> in France (the specific area is not identified: The name suggests Provence, but what&#x27;s in a name?), this soap is less thick and flows smoothly and easily through the pump.</li>
            <li> It is almost a bit watery, not thick, rinsing off with barely any attempt, with no extra reside.</li>
            <li> I found the soap to be fairly thick and have quite a strong lavender smell.  </li>
            <li> The entire package smelled of hand soap and it made a mess to clean up and remove from the box.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little to clean your hands, so the bottle lasts for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> It seems to smell only while washing with it; it rinses away completely.  </li>
            <li> / 500 ml thin plastic bottle with a stylish silver colored bottom</li>
            <li> Our family of three has already gone through about half of this bottle, which means for more than a month this single (roughly) 17-ounce bottle will wash bathroom hands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the soap is less thick than many others, it is not less functional.</li>
            <li> Perhaps in this case, squeaky clean is not a good thing for the hands.</li>
            <li> I found it gentle on my hands, the pump worked well, and as mentioned before, you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this product is highly concentrated, less is required for each use.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure what sage smells like, but I could certainly smell the lavender.  </li>
            <li> In that respect, the bottle of this size would last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why since Lavender essential oil is not hard to come by.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pleasing scent, similar to a holiday blend due to the selection used in making the soap, but so did the Target generic brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is a bit more expensive than equivalent products from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> pump action works well, but a little of the soap did leak out of the pump during shipping.</li>
            <li> The smell is rather masculine, in my opinion, even a little like medicine.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the bottle, for the price, is plastic</li>
            <li> synthetic polymer is based on PEG {polyethylene glycol} and fatty acids derived from coconut oil) , Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose (modified cellulose polymer; used as a gelling and thickening agent), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Linalool (natural?</li>
            <li> Still, it looks like I am on track to have this bottle around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Behind the flowers, there is a distinct smell that simply says, &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; to me, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to describe it any other way.</li>
            <li> As with all other things, all of them are not created equally!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> It help my parents dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Used in small amounts, the Pre de Provence product can likely last as long as several comparable bottles of other brands.</li>
            <li> Not very much,</li>
            <li> Not enough to make a mess, but given the price of the product it was a shame to see any waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit because it foams up quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Though I like it, I can&#x27;t say I would recommend to friends due to the price and the heavy initial scent which may put some people off.</li>
            <li> It takes only a small amount of the soap to wash hands thoroughly, while leaving an agreeable but not overpowering</li>
            <li> Other hand soaps are not like this.  </li>
            <li> I can say it lathered well, based upon the amount on my hands due to trying to get the lid on tight.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, just clean, I guess.</li>
            <li> They do not take over, yet slightly linger after you wash your hands.  </li>
            <li> All though the price of BBW soaps cost less, you will use considerably less soap to wash your hands.  </li>
            <li> A half of pump does the job.</li>
            <li> It has less lather because it&#x27;s glycerin based and has fewer of the chemicals (sulfates and parabens)</li>
            <li> But the scent is odd, a combination of lavender and sage, in which sage predominates.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s to wash my hands, but it&#x27;s so runny and dribbles everywhere.</li>
            <li> You just need a little dab to give lots of suds.</li>
            <li> and it  isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful--not too thin or watered down.  </li>
            <li> container has a wide enough base that I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking it over, and the pump mechanism seems to be well-made -- for a disposable liquid soap container.</li>
            <li> The soap not only cleans dirty hands well,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> But on the flip side, it&#x27;s not too thick.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm....this is a tough one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the ingredients are as follows:</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, why is it so expensive?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap!!  The packaging is beautiful making it a decorative and function piece.  I have one in each of my bathroom, my laundry room and kitchen.  My favorite scent is lavender.  The scents are the perfect strength.  They do not take over, yet slightly linger after you wash your hands.  The liquid is the perfect thickness and allows you to quickly and easily clean your hands.  This soap is a must for everyone!</li>
            <li> The only hand-soap we use.  Great scent (not overpowering) and it  isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> First and foremost the product arrived leaking with the top not secured to the bottle.  The entire package smelled of hand soap and it made a mess to clean up and remove from the box.  I can say it lathered well, based upon the amount on my hands due to trying to get the lid on tight.  After I cleaned up the bottle I took it to the kids/guest bathroom and set it up in a Williams-Sonoma stand and it&#x27;s been there ever since without issue or leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In testing it side by side with generic, name brand and Williams-Sonoma I don&#x27;t see the justification in price.  It lathers well, and so does the generic.  It has a pleasing scent, similar to a holiday blend due to the selection used in making the soap, but so did the Target generic brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t see purchasing it for use in our home, but I would give it as a gift to someone that&#x27;s into that style of soap.  The kids like it, guest enjoy it, but no one has gone out of their way to ask or inquire as to the soap.  It&#x27;s does the job it&#x27;s meant to do and washes off well, so I can say it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful--not too thin or watered down.  But on the flip side, it&#x27;s not too thick.  It clings nicely for the hand wash and smells like a French countryside.  The scent lingers after for a bit so be aware if you wear cologne.  Some soaps feel like water but this is the perfect consistency.  My best friend tried it and she will be switching from Bath and Body Works soaps to this.  All though the price of BBW soaps cost less, you will use considerably less soap to wash your hands.  A half of pump does the job.</li>
            <li> This lavender-scented liquid soap has a powerful, perfumey scent.  It seems to smell only while washing with it; it rinses away completely.  So even though I don&#x27;t normally like heavily-scented products, I kind of like this one.  It&#x27;s a temporary burst of scent that wakes me up, but then it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this in my powder room, and it does seem more elegant (in sight and scent) than a supermarket brand of liquid soap.  But the price means I won&#x27;t be buying a second bottle.  It&#x27;s nice, but not THAT nice.</li>
            <li> This is a 16.9 fluid oz. / 500 ml thin plastic bottle with a stylish silver colored bottom, plastic black arm pump top. The label is stylish as well as the silver/black pump.&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong scent that fills the room when you first open it, then dissipates fast. It does have a lovely, very natural lavender scent, not synthetic perfume smell that will stay on your hands if you put your nose to it. It pumps well, though kind of loose with a good amount of soap coming out. It is almost a bit watery, not thick, rinsing off with barely any attempt, with no extra reside. It seems like it cleans well enough. It rinses faster then the thicker &amp;#34;Trader Joe&#x27;s Trader Jacques French Liquid Orange Blossom Honey Hand and Body Soap&amp;#34; B002UW41WY (much cheaper in store) that I use that is mostly all natural &amp; inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took of two stars was that for the 20 dollars a bottle it charges, I expected mostly all natural ingredients. Unfortunately the ingredients are as follows: (info in parentheses are info I looked up)&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Potassium Cocoate (me: potassium salt of coconut oil), Parfum Fragrance (me: synthetic? most would label it essential oil if it was to show it&#x27;s an expensive ingredient), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (polyethylene glycol derivative), Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate (synthetic polymer is based on PEG {polyethylene glycol} and fatty acids derived from coconut oil) , Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose (modified cellulose polymer; used as a gelling and thickening agent), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Linalool (natural? fragrance), Benzyl Benzoate (solvent &amp; preservative, can cause dermatitis), Geraniol (natural plant oil), Limonene (natural fragrance), Citronellol (natural plant oil), Farnesol (natural or synthetic fragrance), Citral (natural or synthetic plant oil), Coumarin (can be a natural or synthetic fragrance).</li>
            <li> My family has enjoyed using liquid soaps in our house for a long time so we decided to try this one.  It comes in a 16.9 fluid oz. bottle.  The bottle says it is made in France.  It is an attractive bottle.  I found the soap to be fairly thick and have quite a strong lavender smell.  The bottle says lavender sage but I am not sure what sage smells like, but I could certainly smell the lavender.  It is strong so those who do not like strong fragrances may not want to use this kind of soap.  It does not linger on the hand though, especially because after you rinse your hands, the strong scent mostly goes away.  I like a mild lavender scent for things to put around the house, but it can be a strong scent, and I did not really like it on this soap.  You only need to use a little bit because it foams up quite a bit.  In that respect, the bottle of this size would last a long time.  The label says it is made with natural vegetable oils with no artificial coloring.  I found it gentle on my hands, the pump worked well, and as mentioned before, you only need to use a little bit. However, the price for a bottle seems very high to me.  Personally, I prefer Mrs. Myer&#x27;s liquid soaps and fragrances better.  I am giving it three stars mostly because of the high price and I don&#x27;t think the average person would be able to afford this kind of soap to use on a daily basis and that fact that lavender just doesn&#x27;t seem to go well with hand soap.</li>
            <li> Today&#x27;s marketplace is making the simple task of washing one&#x27;s hands interesting....This liquid soap from Pre de Provence is an excellent choice for  use for oneself and others in one&#x27;s home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasing. It takes only a small amount of the soap to wash hands thoroughly, while leaving an agreeable but not overpowering aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include glycerin and coconut oil. Coconut oil has emerged in recent years as a powerful substance for healthy skin care. It&#x27;s surely a fine choice for the sensitive skin on the hands, particularly on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product is highly concentrated, less is required for each use. This can help make up for the high price. Used in small amounts, the Pre de Provence product can likely last as long as several comparable bottles of other brands.</li>
            <li> As a frequent hand washer who loves the scent of lavender this soap was ideal for me. It&#x27;s not antibacterial, it&#x27;s just mild handsoap without parabens and is vegetable based. It looks nice is the bathroom and is made in France. The scent is powerful but pleasant and it didn&#x27;t dry my hands out like the antibacterial soap (from other brands) frequently does.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Not only is the smell great, it works great too.  I spilled some gel food coloring on my hands.  This soap took it off no problem with out drying my hands.  The smell is amazing... not too strong like some lavender soaps.  The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
            <li> I did not like this soap at all. It is very watery and smells &amp;#34;perfume like.&amp;#34; If you don&#x27;t like heavy, musky perfume, you will not like this soap.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soap. Besides smelling great, it goes a really long way. You just need a little dab to give lots of suds. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> This soap has a pleasant scent and a pleasant feel. Unlike most liquid soaps we use, it feels a little oily in that it doesn&#x27;t wash off completely. But the residue is not unpleasant and my hands do feel clean after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump action works well, but a little of the soap did leak out of the pump during shipping. Not enough to make a mess, but given the price of the product it was a shame to see any waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tend to use something of a bargain brand rather than a Made in France luxury soap. But this is nice to have for times when a little more elegant alternative seems warranted.</li>
            <li> This product has a medium-light floral scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it does fade pretty quickly so you won&#x27;t be wandering around and smelling like flowers all day. Behind the flowers, there is a distinct smell that simply says, &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; to me, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to describe it any other way. It isn&#x27;t bad, just clean, I guess. The product doesn&#x27;t create a massive amount of lather, but my hands do feel clean and not dried out after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after several weeks of using this nearly every day, it does not seem that the level in the bottle has dropped very much. I only use a single (whole) pump when washing my hands, and that is more than enough. Still, it looks like I am on track to have this bottle around for a long time. That&#x27;s got to be worth something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container has a wide enough base that I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking it over, and the pump mechanism seems to be well-made -- for a disposable liquid soap container.</li>
            <li> This is good and it smells good. It help my parents dry hands.  This is worth getting for all the areas in your home</li>
            <li> I have been using various types of liquid-pump hand soap in my home for many years. As with all other things, all of them are not created equally! Up until now, my favorite was an organic one that sometimes jels up at the end of the spout because, I think, the soap is a bit too viscous (thick) for the size of the dispensing pump. This is not an uncommon situation. After using this liquid soap from Pre de Provence for a week or so, I am pleased (and somewhat surprised) to say that I have a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in France (the specific area is not identified: The name suggests Provence, but what&#x27;s in a name?), this soap is less thick and flows smoothly and easily through the pump. It has several ingredients targeted at moisturizing as we know that hand-washing - especially frequent hand washing- can and does have the impact of leaving the skin on one&#x27;s hands all dried out and even, sometimes, flaky.The fact that this soap is not tested on animals is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, as others have pointed out, the aroma is strong and MUCH more like Sage than like Lavender, I did not find this an issue. The smell of the soap is reduced to a mild suggestive-scent after rinsing the hands off with clear water - and don&#x27;t we all do that? The price is high - some would say exorbitant.  I didn&#x27;t think so. It seems a bit much for everyday use, but as a gift or in your own bathroom as a special treat, it is very nice. I plan to buy some more of it when the current container runs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the soap is less thick than many others, it is not less functional. That is to say that I found that using a few drops is more than adequate for routine hand washing. I expect this 16.9 oz. container to last for many months of daily use by two people. It is, by no means, a &#x27;bargain&#x27; item - but one that can be a welcome compliment to the most private of rooms where we may tend to pamper ourselves, in very personal ways. This would be one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/16/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered our third bottle. Lasts a l....o....n....g  time. Nice feature: The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@ It is a regular on the bathroom sink!16/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered our third bottle. Lasts a l....o....n....g  time. Nice feature: The pump tube actually reaches very close to the bottom of the bottle - so unlike so many other pump products, getting the last bit out is as easy as the first pumpful@ It is a regular on the bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> Hmmm....this is a tough one. The soap is nice. It&#x27;s fragrant, it lathers, it cleans. The bottle is a nice, large size. But...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great value for the money. The product packaging isn&#x27;t high end enough to justify the much higher cost. It&#x27;s a plastic bottle of soap (not even glass!), just a step above drugstore brands. I&#x27;d hesitate to buy this, at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is luxurious-smelling soap.  It has less lather because it&#x27;s glycerin based and has fewer of the chemicals (sulfates and parabens) so it does not make many suds.  You only need a little to clean your hands, so the bottle lasts for quite some time.  It also was not tested on animals if that is important to you.  It works well and smells wonderful - the lavender is real and does not have a fake perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the price is very high.  You can get soap that is just as good with all of the above benefits for slightly cheaper.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap is one example.  However, if you have the cash and like the packaging, which is actually quite aesthetic, go for it.  I expect such soaps to be pricier than the grocery store stuff for sure... but this is a bit more expensive than equivalent products from other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This is a soap that I will gladly leave out when I have guests.  The bottle looks very nice and it is a good soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was a bit overpowering to me at first, but after a bit of use I really like it.  It left my hands feeling soft, and clean, not at all dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this soap is quite spendy, so it&#x27;s not something I would buy a lot of, but it would make a great gift, and like I mentioned, it is great for a guest bath, to make your guests feel special.</li>
            <li> This is a good sized plastic bottle of soap with a pump dispenser.  I like the look of it, however, the scent is too overpowering for me.  It&#x27;s labeled sage and lavender, but the sage is so strongly scented that I can&#x27;t smell very much lavender at all.  The smell is rather masculine, in my opinion, even a little like medicine.  Every person is different as far as what scents they find attractive, so someone else might just love it.  Personally, it&#x27;s just not my cup of tea</li>
            <li> I make my own body oils and hair oil with olive oil and lavender from my garden.  I love the smell of lavender and this soap, with the hint of sage, fills the shower with the scent...like a whole field of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;This soap feels so nice and my skin feel soft and moisturized right out of the shower.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would have to say I didn&#x27;t love this from the get go....it rather grows on you though.  The scent is strong on the lavender and then you get the scent of the sage in it.  It is almost a little too much at first but the scent quickly dissipates.  The soap does not dry and leaves your hands feeling nice and soft.  I was a little surprised that the bottle, for the price, is plastic, it seems that this item is above the normal price scale for like products so I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase it at the going price, but as far as the quality I think it is good, though a different scent, maybe something a bit lighter or more citrusy might be a little better.  Overall, a nice product, a little pricey though in my opinion.  I probably would not purchase but will enjoy it until I finish it up.  Though I like it, I can&#x27;t say I would recommend to friends due to the price and the heavy initial scent which may put some people off.</li>
            <li> This is a fine hand soap with a slight clove smell which I like. However the overall scent is pretty strong so while it is usable for me I prefer a softer scent. I give it an extra star because my wife and daughter like it. It is obviously an excellent product though. If you don&#x27;t mind a stronger scent this will be fine for you.</li>
            <li> We use a lot of essential oils at home for a variety of things and have access to therapeutic grade lavender essential oil and the wife and I do not think this smells like lavender even with just the hint of sage.  She has refused to keep using this because she doesn&#x27;t like the smell, though I don&#x27;t care either way.&lt;br /&gt;I will state however that this doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing, because after using my hands are squeaky Tupperware clean.  Other hand soaps are not like this.  Perhaps in this case, squeaky clean is not a good thing for the hands.</li>
            <li> Everyone in our family likes this soap. One pump puts 1/2 teaspoon of this mildly fragrant soap in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Just enough to make a good lather but not be wasteful. The soap not only cleans dirty hands well,&lt;br /&gt;but also leaves them feeling silky soft, smooth, and smelling slightly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good quality soap, made with natural vegetable oils, glycerin and coconut oil which naturally moisturizes skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors or animal testing. The lavender/sage is a pleasing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles shabby chic motif blends well with any decor.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle holds 16.9 oz and the pump works smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product of France.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water - Potassium Cocoate - Parfum (fragrance) - Peg 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil - Peg 7 Glyceryl Cocoate -&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin - Hydroxyethylcellulose - Cocos Nucifera (coconut) oil - Linalool - Benzyl Benzoate -&lt;br /&gt;Geraniol - Limonene - Citronellol - Farnesol - Citral - Coumarin.</li>
            <li> This is a  nice strong lavender-scented soap that doesn&#x27;t linger after use. It comes in a pump bottle made of plastic with an appealing old-fashioned looking label. My mother and I both found the scent to be very nice, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is a good thing, considering it is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the ritzy looking packaging the product is not all-natural, but contains chemical scents. I&#x27;m not sure why since Lavender essential oil is not hard to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this product is the packaging. The lid on my bottle had come unscrewed and the product had leaked. Not very much, but I think the manufacturer needs to come up with a better lid/stopper/pump arrangement.</li>
            <li> The soap itself smells good. We put it in place of our normal soap in the guest bathroom and have had a few guests mention how they liked the smell of it. Whenever you do use it you can smell it pretty potently in the bathroom for a little bit after each dispense action. It&#x27;s kind of nice to act as a little mini perfume in a way but it doesn&#x27;t stick around for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of it on my hands and it smells nice. I&#x27;d say the only downside is that the bottle is plastic and the price is pretty hefty for soap. The smell reminds me of some lavender cologne I used to have as a kid -- I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The soap has a strong, wonderful smell and I agree with others that it&#x27;s much heavier on the sage than the lavender. It feels nice on the skin with lots of foam, and is easy to rinse off unlike some soaps that leave a lingering slipperiness.  The bottle is quite pretty and mine arrived intact with nothing leaking. But even though the soap is somewhat concentrated I just can&#x27;t see paying $20-ish for a plastic bottle of hand soap. I hope the manufacturer reconsiders the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the product.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for the price.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is good enough.  It lathers nicely.  It cleans.  But the scent is odd, a combination of lavender and sage, in which sage predominates.  I prefer lavender as sage reminds me of dressing in the Thanksgiving turkey.</li>
            <li> When this soap arrived, the box was highly aromatic as the seal was loose between the bottle and the dispenser top, and a small amount of the liquid had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could already tell this was a soap my wife would like. (She is a Francophile and uses natural cleaning options, so a sage-scented hand soap from France is the best of both worlds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is strong when you apply it, but the scent is pleasing. The liquid feels a bit slippery going on, but it washes off fairly easily. And it leaves a lingering aroma along the lines of your better kind of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit steep, and I wish it hadn’t leaked in transit, but if you like rich-smelling hand soap, you’ll probably enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Oh YESSSS. This stuff  smells great -- super lavendar-y, of course, but with the bright fresh herby smell of sage too! It also has a great consistency. I typically use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s to wash my hands, but it&#x27;s so runny and dribbles everywhere. This stuff stays where it&#x27;s spooged, but rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of this soap also LOOKS lovely sitting by the sink. So yes: I like it. This is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, why is it so expensive? $20 seems steep, especially for something that&#x27;s got a host of synthetic ingredients I associate with cheap grocery store soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love love it love it... But the price point makes it special occasion soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is natural, not cloying or too intense. There&#x27;s a hint of lavender, a bit of citronella, and a light bass note of sage---barely discernible. The lather is just right, and the consistency seems a bit thinner than many other liquid soaps, which I found appealing.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it is wildly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it for myself because it&#x27;s not important enough in my hedonic calculus; however, if I had a friend who loved this sort of thing it would make a lovely present.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a big, hairy man, but I’m secure enough to state that this stuff smells great.  It pumps easily from the original bottle (or any pump bottle you may choose to use).  It washes up well, cleaning quickly and thoroughly, and then rinses quickly and without a slippery residue.  The best part is that when you’re done your hands smell just like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True decadence would be to use this as your bathing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: This bottle comes in at about $20.  That’s spendy.  But then again, it’s got great indegrients, and it’s imported from France.  This is not knockoff soap; this is the real deal, and you get what you pay for.  Our family of three has already gone through about half of this bottle, which means for more than a month this single (roughly) 17-ounce bottle will wash bathroom hands.  If you look at it that way, the value isn’t really that far out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is a very luxurious, maybe even decadent, product.  It’s a bit spendy, but is well worth the price.</li>
