            <li>I bought this for Halloween and I&#x27;m VERY pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li>Try to get better as a seller!</li>
            <li>Considering how cheap this wig is, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal.  </li>
            <li>so I was planning to cut it, but I have to say it is a fantastic wig, great for the Marciline cosplays</li>
            <li>We used it at a convention for Marceline the Vampire Queen and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig four days ago and got it yesterday, which was amazing.</li>
            <li>This wig is quite amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked this wig.</li>
            <li>It was a really nice wig.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li>If I had gotten this, I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it.</li>
            <li>The wig is nice quality and looks</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll have to trim them, but that allows you to choose your own style.  </li>
            <li>my good people yes more hair in my brush</li>
            <li>Very nice quality, And very pretty!</li>
            <li>I am very happy for this wig.i highly suggest buying it</li>
            <li>The hair got tangled very easily</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to see hair underneath.</li>
            <li>But it is an awesome wig with a great look, and if you comb it out regularly, you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>, it tangles easily, I would buy this product again if needed!</li>
            <li>If you know about hair and wigs this is easy to care for!</li>
            <li>It was very easily tangled by not even touching it.</li>
            <li>I would buy again from this seller shipping was great and fast too!</li>
            <li>The feel of the fibers is very smooth.</li>
            <li>hair fibers are very smooth and silky and, as most wigs do, will tangle with lots of use</li>
            <li>The hair/fibers isn&#x27;t course and very free flowing and light!</li>
            <li>I love this wig and so do my friends.</li>
            <li>so many people have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Great thick bangs perfect to style in any way.</li>
            <li>This wig does look like authentic hair</li>
            <li>more like- &#x27;</li>
            <li>I cut mine into a stylish bob</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ll be using this for hell girl and mio akiyama.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wig, looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t plan on wearing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this wig</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This wig is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I bought this for a Marceline cosplay and I truely love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this wig is perfect for the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be okay for my cosplay, but it is tooo thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like it to be slightly more manageable.</li>
            <li>The fibers are smooth and feel nice, though they tangle easily.</li>
            <li>True to color &amp; nice length.</li>
            <li>I went as Cher and cut the long side bangs into forehead bangs, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I am new to wigs but this one is great.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought this wig was going to be harsh synthetic like a Party City wig, but it&#x27;s of great quality!</li>
            <li>Very well made wig, very happy with it&#x27;s style and feeling; like real hair!&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Shipping time was faster than expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>I received the wig very quickly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was packaged in a plastic bag and also inside a ziplock bag with a hair net.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did tangle fairly easily</li>
            <li>Lots of hair and easy to cut for the style I needed.</li>
            <li>Because of its length it tangles really easy.</li>
            <li>if you never wear wings like me then yes this hair will get messed up easily.</li>
            <li>But it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li>The hair is easy to part, and stays in place quite well.</li>
            <li>so it was tangled easily.</li>
            <li>Tangles EXTREMELY easily.</li>
            <li>Not the write color and tangled easily.</li>
            <li>It was pretty nice in the beginning until I combed it out...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty shiny, but not like the kind of shiny  </li>
            <li>Super easy to do the signature &amp;#34;Cher head/hair flip.&amp;#34;  :-)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kinda noticeable), but there are tutorials on how to easily give yourself a more natural part or skin patch there to your own skin tone</li>
            <li>The fibers from right out of the packaging were beautiful and soft at the top but some decent knots at the bottom were prominent and visible.</li>
            <li>Definitely more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also perfect for everyday wear-</li>
            <li>you get from those ultra cheap Halloween wigs,</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>The Wake is really smooth</li>
            <li>I was planning on using it for a Marceline cosplay, from Adventure Time, but it wasn&#x27;t much longer than my own</li>
            <li>so it looks smooth again.</li>
            <li>I tried it on and I was pleased as it was a decent thickness on top</li>
            <li>Its a pretty nice wig, thats worth the price.  </li>
            <li>i love the wig but it was really really nappy when i took it out the package i love how its long and stuff the bangs are beautiful and the problem was it was very very nappy when  took it out the pack took me forever to brush it out.</li>
            <li>and I was just too excited to wait.</li>
            <li>I was close to rating this lower, but when I took the price into consideration it&#x27;s definitely worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;ll be good for a cosplay. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I ordered it, plus it&#x27;s one of the most reasonably priced wigs on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Still a pretty good wig with soft hair if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>It looked nice and natural when I wore it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to brush it without wefts of hair coming out, I&#x27;m able to style it on low heat, and it&#x27;s tangle free.</li>
            <li>in all I loved the product and I will be wearing it regularly, and ordering another to style to my preferences!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s good enough for that</li>
            <li>I love this wig so much already</li>
            <li>She loved it,has styled it and will wear it to the next anime con in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughters cosplaying and I was surprised at how nice it was.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I kind of don&#x27;t like is that it tangles really easily.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great wig.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was much more realistic than the stuff you get at the costume stores.  </li>
            <li>it gets tangled too quickly.</li>
            <li>I used this wig for Halloween and it got tangled quickly.</li>
            <li>so i thought i&#x27;d try out this wig since it had many decent reviews.</li>
            <li>Very long, okay quality, gets tangled/static-y very easily.</li>
            <li>, I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I needed this wig for a cosplay, and it was long with relatively good quality fibers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was good for its price.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a Japanese wig, the structure was kind of different: there was no sideburn part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I got the wig four days after I ordered it, so very soon!!</li>
            <li>Its very thick at the top, and thinner at the bottom, so I might add wefts to it for thickness, but it really is great.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really liked it.</li>
            <li>This wig is so long I love this product!</li>
            <li>Nice and long.</li>
            <li>Long wigs are a pain to keep nice during wear and storage.  </li>
            <li>Wig is nice and long.</li>
            <li>The material feels pretty realistic, and it adjusts well to fit on your head.  </li>
            <li>This material is super fine, so you have to be careful or it becomes tangled quite easily.  </li>
            <li>The bangs go past my neck and the wig is just very full and nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I was able to make it look pretty smooth by using Mane N&#x27; Tail detangler and a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>The length was ok but it tangled right away and only got to wear it once.  </li>
            <li>bought 2 of it and used prime, and it came very fast.</li>
            <li>Was exactly the l like the picture and description.</li>
            <li>wig is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;) would def recomend</li>
            <li>My daughter bought this one for the same price as shorter ones and was able to cut it to the EXACT length she needed.</li>
            <li>Very Dissapoited!</li>
            <li>There was some concern about shedding when I first opened it, but it has stopped since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>You can find better ones from Map Of Beauty for only $8-$12!</li>
            <li>It looks and feels real!  </li>
            <li>It looked real!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know how to take care of it at first but now</li>
            <li>The wig is nice and smooth but it gets tangled too easily and the wig cap is far too small to fit many people : /</li>
            <li>Other than that, it didn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, so I had to get my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high quality for the price, and it looks super realistic.</li>
            <li>Very nice for all of those cosplays with those really sweet girls with long black hair.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty real once you put it on.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is is that it tangles really really easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a smidge large on me</li>
            <li>This wig is alright, its pretty much what i expected for the price, not as nice and shiny as in the picture and hard to comb out and make it stay nice.</li>
            <li>but if you just brushed it out with a WIG BRUSH or WIG COMB it was fine.</li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous after viewing the bad reviews of the wig if it was going to be okay, but it turned out just fine.</li>
            <li>Very full and long - waist length on me</li>
            <li>I would only suggest this wig if you need it fast and cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would not recommend to anyone who actually wants to wear it..</li>
            <li>it looks like real hair and some people asked if it was my real hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really adorable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its cheap compared to a lot of cosplay wigs, similar length wigs cost $40-$60.</li>
            <li>They also made it very distinctive where the bangs and side burns should be.</li>
            <li>I can wear it all the time and it matches my real hair</li>
            <li>I can also put it in a pony tail and it look so real</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li>I need to comb out this hair a lot to get ready of knots and tangles.</li>
            <li>and I needed it fast because the convention I am to attend to is this weekend.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wear it much anymore.  </li>
            <li>I got this wig for a cosplay I&#x27;m working on, and its going to work really well.</li>
            <li>The way the construction of the hair is layered is done really well.  </li>
            <li>Way too much money for that.  </li>
            <li>This is not a wig where you have to worry about the scalp showing if you move the hair too much.</li>
            <li>almost really feels like a real hair.</li>
            <li>I do not like this wig that much.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>It also tangled way too much.</li>
            <li>Still a pretty cool wig overall.</li>
            <li>It was very sparse and not much hair up top.</li>
            <li>First off i was much suprised how early it came!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>This wig was surprisingly heavy and tangled very easily.  </li>
            <li>only complaint would be that there isn&#x27;t a more noticeable &#x27;skin patch&#x27; at the top</li>
            <li>The wig is shiny, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>It was pretty soft when I got it and opened it.</li>
            <li>It was more mid back for her and me</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t as long as i thought, but i think it&#x27;s ok, thanks, i&#x27;ll need of you in the next time</li>
            <li>So while this is a really good wig, be cautious if you have had trouble getting wigs to fit in the past.</li>
            <li>It got here quickly and looks really silky, i just have to buy a wig brush because since its so long it tangles alot</li>
            <li>Only problem seems to be that it tangles easily, but you expect that with such long fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and even came with a little free gift!  </li>
            <li>I have only even owned those super cheap halloween wigs that fall apart in a few days</li>
            <li>It fit well, though the wig cap was kind of awkward.  </li>
            <li>The wig is very long, and unfortunately long wigs tangle more.</li>
            <li>It was definitely a lot more thin than I expected, but it was still a nice wig.</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic and if you keep the rubberband on the wig where it looks like a ponytail you can somewhat avoid the slightly odd line you get in the wig.</li>
            <li>it was heavy and easy to fall off.  </li>
            <li>It is expected that it will get tangled as it is so long and lacks the natural hair oils, but it is lovely.</li>
            <li>the bangs are as long as shown in the photo.the shipping was also very fast</li>
            <li>; I get it, but do they shed so much that you find giant hairballs, everywhere and have to throw the wig out because it lost almost all of it&#x27;s hair?</li>
            <li>wig or natural)</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the packaging, because it was just like wigs thrown into a bag...not a box.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how to get it back to it&#x27;s smoothness and straight.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>oh wow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no where near the length they said it was.</li>
            <li>Received my wig early.</li>
            <li>but it looks professional.</li>
            <li>It tangled really easily and is incredibly sensitive to heat damage, which is to be expected of a long synthetic wig and there are ways to prevent that</li>
            <li>It gets tangled really easily, but that is to be expected from a long wig.</li>
            <li>hummmm...would likt it better if it has the usual comb!</li>
            <li>short, i&#x27;m hoping other future wigs i may purchase from this company with be better.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a Marceline cosplay, and did use it for that a few times.  </li>
            <li>I am a Japanese student studying in American college, and this was my first wig I bought in</li>
            <li>this long before (this one is 100 cm, I measured it), so I don&#x27;t know how much they are supposed to tangle at this length.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t say anything because I don&#x27;t know how American wigs are normally delivered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that it tangles easily, but that is to be expected of long wigs.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t actually wear this for Halloween because it was just too hard to style into a sexy style.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying a new wig elsewhere if I ever plan on wearing this cosplay to a con though.</li>
            <li>and I have some trouble getting it to fit properly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recomend such a long wig for first time wig buyers.</li>
            <li>this is a really cheap wig; it tangles easily and very difficult to brush out.</li>
            <li>A wide toothed comb, and a small bottle of 2 TBS of fabric softener, and the rest water, and it will detangle it and make it near smooth as new.</li>
            <li>Having no experience with wigs before, I am having a hard time keeping it detangled and smooth.</li>
            <li>with minimal wear, it tangled REALLY badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely wore it and it still tangled.</li>
            <li>Stays put on your head very well though one of the elastic bands that makes it smaller comes loose All the time.</li>
            <li>It is really heavy on my head, and you have to make sure the wig is really tight to ensure it stays put.</li>
            <li>Also, the netting is extremely visible if you pull too much hair forward and can be visible in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long and very soft.</li>
            <li>me, who have been buying many wigs in Japan, I thought the fibers were little bit thin, causing the wig to be a little bit easy to get tangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(other reviewers of other wigs have complained that there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair on some wigs, but this one is almost a full head&#x27;s worth).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this, the hair is very thick ,very soft, and has a natural shine to it (like real hair, not like bag shiny wig hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again if I have cause to make another several black cosplay wigs [or one very voluptuous mane].</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick, but that&#x27;s to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Theres a small skin top that is attatched on the outside, which is odd and causes the wig to have a strange shape.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great wig :)</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li> Try to get better as a seller!</li>
            <li> Considering how cheap this wig is, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal.  </li>
            <li> so I was planning to cut it, but I have to say it is a fantastic wig, great for the Marciline cosplays</li>
            <li> We used it at a convention for Marceline the Vampire Queen and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig four days ago and got it yesterday, which was amazing.</li>
            <li> This wig is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this wig.</li>
            <li> It was a really nice wig.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li> If I had gotten this, I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it.</li>
            <li> The wig is nice quality and looks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have to trim them, but that allows you to choose your own style.  </li>
            <li> my good people yes more hair in my brush</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, And very pretty!</li>
            <li> I am very happy for this wig.i highly suggest buying it</li>
            <li> The hair got tangled very easily</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to see hair underneath.</li>
            <li> But it is an awesome wig with a great look, and if you comb it out regularly, you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> , it tangles easily, I would buy this product again if needed!</li>
            <li> If you know about hair and wigs this is easy to care for!</li>
            <li> It was very easily tangled by not even touching it.</li>
            <li> I would buy again from this seller shipping was great and fast too!</li>
            <li> The feel of the fibers is very smooth.</li>
            <li> hair fibers are very smooth and silky and, as most wigs do, will tangle with lots of use</li>
            <li> The hair/fibers isn&#x27;t course and very free flowing and light!</li>
            <li> I love this wig and so do my friends.</li>
            <li> so many people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Great thick bangs perfect to style in any way.</li>
            <li> This wig does look like authentic hair</li>
            <li> more like- &#x27;</li>
            <li> I cut mine into a stylish bob</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ll be using this for hell girl and mio akiyama.  </li>
            <li> This is a great wig, looks and feels real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t plan on wearing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this wig</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This wig is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Marceline cosplay and I truely love it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this wig is perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be okay for my cosplay, but it is tooo thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like it to be slightly more manageable.</li>
            <li> The fibers are smooth and feel nice, though they tangle easily.</li>
            <li> True to color &amp; nice length.</li>
            <li> I went as Cher and cut the long side bangs into forehead bangs, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I am new to wigs but this one is great.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this wig was going to be harsh synthetic like a Party City wig, but it&#x27;s of great quality!</li>
            <li> Very well made wig, very happy with it&#x27;s style and feeling; like real hair!&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Shipping time was faster than expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> I received the wig very quickly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was packaged in a plastic bag and also inside a ziplock bag with a hair net.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did tangle fairly easily</li>
            <li> Lots of hair and easy to cut for the style I needed.</li>
            <li> Because of its length it tangles really easy.</li>
            <li> if you never wear wings like me then yes this hair will get messed up easily.</li>
            <li> But it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li> The hair is easy to part, and stays in place quite well.</li>
            <li> so it was tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Tangles EXTREMELY easily.</li>
            <li> Not the write color and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> It was pretty nice in the beginning until I combed it out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty shiny, but not like the kind of shiny  </li>
            <li> Super easy to do the signature &amp;#34;Cher head/hair flip.&amp;#34;  :-)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kinda noticeable), but there are tutorials on how to easily give yourself a more natural part or skin patch there to your own skin tone</li>
            <li> The fibers from right out of the packaging were beautiful and soft at the top but some decent knots at the bottom were prominent and visible.</li>
            <li> Definitely more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also perfect for everyday wear-</li>
            <li> you get from those ultra cheap Halloween wigs,</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Wake is really smooth</li>
            <li> I was planning on using it for a Marceline cosplay, from Adventure Time, but it wasn&#x27;t much longer than my own</li>
            <li> so it looks smooth again.</li>
            <li> I tried it on and I was pleased as it was a decent thickness on top</li>
            <li> Its a pretty nice wig, thats worth the price.  </li>
            <li> i love the wig but it was really really nappy when i took it out the package i love how its long and stuff the bangs are beautiful and the problem was it was very very nappy when  took it out the pack took me forever to brush it out.</li>
            <li> and I was just too excited to wait.</li>
            <li> I was close to rating this lower, but when I took the price into consideration it&#x27;s definitely worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;ll be good for a cosplay. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I ordered it, plus it&#x27;s one of the most reasonably priced wigs on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Still a pretty good wig with soft hair if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> It looked nice and natural when I wore it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to brush it without wefts of hair coming out, I&#x27;m able to style it on low heat, and it&#x27;s tangle free.</li>
            <li> in all I loved the product and I will be wearing it regularly, and ordering another to style to my preferences!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s good enough for that</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much already</li>
            <li> She loved it,has styled it and will wear it to the next anime con in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters cosplaying and I was surprised at how nice it was.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I kind of don&#x27;t like is that it tangles really easily.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great wig.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was much more realistic than the stuff you get at the costume stores.  </li>
            <li> it gets tangled too quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this wig for Halloween and it got tangled quickly.</li>
            <li> so i thought i&#x27;d try out this wig since it had many decent reviews.</li>
            <li> Very long, okay quality, gets tangled/static-y very easily.</li>
            <li> , I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I needed this wig for a cosplay, and it was long with relatively good quality fibers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was good for its price.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a Japanese wig, the structure was kind of different: there was no sideburn part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I got the wig four days after I ordered it, so very soon!!</li>
            <li> Its very thick at the top, and thinner at the bottom, so I might add wefts to it for thickness, but it really is great.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really liked it.</li>
            <li> This wig is so long I love this product!</li>
            <li> Nice and long.</li>
            <li> Long wigs are a pain to keep nice during wear and storage.  </li>
            <li> Wig is nice and long.</li>
            <li> The material feels pretty realistic, and it adjusts well to fit on your head.  </li>
            <li> This material is super fine, so you have to be careful or it becomes tangled quite easily.  </li>
            <li> The bangs go past my neck and the wig is just very full and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I was able to make it look pretty smooth by using Mane N&#x27; Tail detangler and a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> The length was ok but it tangled right away and only got to wear it once.  </li>
            <li> bought 2 of it and used prime, and it came very fast.</li>
            <li> Was exactly the l like the picture and description.</li>
            <li> wig is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;) would def recomend</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this one for the same price as shorter ones and was able to cut it to the EXACT length she needed.</li>
            <li> Very Dissapoited!</li>
            <li> There was some concern about shedding when I first opened it, but it has stopped since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> You can find better ones from Map Of Beauty for only $8-$12!</li>
            <li> It looks and feels real!  </li>
            <li> It looked real!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know how to take care of it at first but now</li>
            <li> The wig is nice and smooth but it gets tangled too easily and the wig cap is far too small to fit many people : /</li>
            <li> Other than that, it didn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, so I had to get my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high quality for the price, and it looks super realistic.</li>
            <li> Very nice for all of those cosplays with those really sweet girls with long black hair.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty real once you put it on.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is is that it tangles really really easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a smidge large on me</li>
            <li> This wig is alright, its pretty much what i expected for the price, not as nice and shiny as in the picture and hard to comb out and make it stay nice.</li>
            <li> but if you just brushed it out with a WIG BRUSH or WIG COMB it was fine.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous after viewing the bad reviews of the wig if it was going to be okay, but it turned out just fine.</li>
            <li> Very full and long - waist length on me</li>
            <li> I would only suggest this wig if you need it fast and cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would not recommend to anyone who actually wants to wear it..</li>
            <li> it looks like real hair and some people asked if it was my real hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really adorable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its cheap compared to a lot of cosplay wigs, similar length wigs cost $40-$60.</li>
            <li> They also made it very distinctive where the bangs and side burns should be.</li>
            <li> I can wear it all the time and it matches my real hair</li>
            <li> I can also put it in a pony tail and it look so real</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li> I need to comb out this hair a lot to get ready of knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> and I needed it fast because the convention I am to attend to is this weekend.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wear it much anymore.  </li>
            <li> I got this wig for a cosplay I&#x27;m working on, and its going to work really well.</li>
            <li> The way the construction of the hair is layered is done really well.  </li>
            <li> Way too much money for that.  </li>
            <li> This is not a wig where you have to worry about the scalp showing if you move the hair too much.</li>
            <li> almost really feels like a real hair.</li>
            <li> I do not like this wig that much.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> It also tangled way too much.</li>
            <li> Still a pretty cool wig overall.</li>
            <li> It was very sparse and not much hair up top.</li>
            <li> First off i was much suprised how early it came!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This wig was surprisingly heavy and tangled very easily.  </li>
            <li> only complaint would be that there isn&#x27;t a more noticeable &#x27;skin patch&#x27; at the top</li>
            <li> The wig is shiny, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> It was pretty soft when I got it and opened it.</li>
            <li> It was more mid back for her and me</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as long as i thought, but i think it&#x27;s ok, thanks, i&#x27;ll need of you in the next time</li>
            <li> So while this is a really good wig, be cautious if you have had trouble getting wigs to fit in the past.</li>
            <li> It got here quickly and looks really silky, i just have to buy a wig brush because since its so long it tangles alot</li>
            <li> Only problem seems to be that it tangles easily, but you expect that with such long fine hair.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and even came with a little free gift!  </li>
            <li> I have only even owned those super cheap halloween wigs that fall apart in a few days</li>
            <li> It fit well, though the wig cap was kind of awkward.  </li>
            <li> The wig is very long, and unfortunately long wigs tangle more.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a lot more thin than I expected, but it was still a nice wig.</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic and if you keep the rubberband on the wig where it looks like a ponytail you can somewhat avoid the slightly odd line you get in the wig.</li>
            <li> it was heavy and easy to fall off.  </li>
            <li> It is expected that it will get tangled as it is so long and lacks the natural hair oils, but it is lovely.</li>
            <li> the bangs are as long as shown in the photo.the shipping was also very fast</li>
            <li> ; I get it, but do they shed so much that you find giant hairballs, everywhere and have to throw the wig out because it lost almost all of it&#x27;s hair?</li>
            <li> wig or natural)</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the packaging, because it was just like wigs thrown into a bag...not a box.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how to get it back to it&#x27;s smoothness and straight.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> oh wow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no where near the length they said it was.</li>
            <li> Received my wig early.</li>
            <li> but it looks professional.</li>
            <li> It tangled really easily and is incredibly sensitive to heat damage, which is to be expected of a long synthetic wig and there are ways to prevent that</li>
            <li> It gets tangled really easily, but that is to be expected from a long wig.</li>
            <li> hummmm...would likt it better if it has the usual comb!</li>
            <li> short, i&#x27;m hoping other future wigs i may purchase from this company with be better.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a Marceline cosplay, and did use it for that a few times.  </li>
            <li> I am a Japanese student studying in American college, and this was my first wig I bought in</li>
            <li> this long before (this one is 100 cm, I measured it), so I don&#x27;t know how much they are supposed to tangle at this length.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t say anything because I don&#x27;t know how American wigs are normally delivered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it tangles easily, but that is to be expected of long wigs.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t actually wear this for Halloween because it was just too hard to style into a sexy style.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying a new wig elsewhere if I ever plan on wearing this cosplay to a con though.</li>
            <li> and I have some trouble getting it to fit properly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recomend such a long wig for first time wig buyers.</li>
            <li> this is a really cheap wig; it tangles easily and very difficult to brush out.</li>
            <li> A wide toothed comb, and a small bottle of 2 TBS of fabric softener, and the rest water, and it will detangle it and make it near smooth as new.</li>
            <li> Having no experience with wigs before, I am having a hard time keeping it detangled and smooth.</li>
            <li> with minimal wear, it tangled REALLY badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely wore it and it still tangled.</li>
            <li> Stays put on your head very well though one of the elastic bands that makes it smaller comes loose All the time.</li>
            <li> It is really heavy on my head, and you have to make sure the wig is really tight to ensure it stays put.</li>
            <li> Also, the netting is extremely visible if you pull too much hair forward and can be visible in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long and very soft.</li>
            <li> me, who have been buying many wigs in Japan, I thought the fibers were little bit thin, causing the wig to be a little bit easy to get tangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (other reviewers of other wigs have complained that there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair on some wigs, but this one is almost a full head&#x27;s worth).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this, the hair is very thick ,very soft, and has a natural shine to it (like real hair, not like bag shiny wig hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again if I have cause to make another several black cosplay wigs [or one very voluptuous mane].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very thick, but that&#x27;s to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Theres a small skin top that is attatched on the outside, which is odd and causes the wig to have a strange shape.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it tangles... but other than that it looks n feels natural.</li>
            <li> so I had to re-adjust frequently, but other than that, no issues.</li>
            <li> The part is awkward &amp; the layering weird, but it is easily detangled, smooth, &amp; somewhat real looking.</li>
            <li> Super uncomfortable and just a basic hot mess..</li>
            <li> but it is a long wig and it only took a bit of detailer and comb.</li>
            <li> Was annoyed to find out with standard shipping it wasn&#x27;t due to arrive for almost 2 months (ordered on Oct. 3 &amp; was due between Nov. 4th - Nov. 21st), so I switched to expedited shipping for $22 just to be sure it was here on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a wig buyer</li>
            <li> beware if you care for it it should last long!</li>
            <li> Have to keep it in the bag and comb through it when I wear it because it is prone to tangle because it is very long, but its not a big problem.</li>
            <li> The wig is rather shiny, but because it&#x27;s black, it manages to look natural.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this wig isn&#x27;t bad at all unless you don&#x27;t know how to take care of a wig.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s long hair</li>
            <li> IT is SOOOOOO LONG.</li>
            <li> its so long and movable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long as I thought it was</li>
            <li> And it takes a really long time to get to you and there is no tracking info</li>
            <li> so it was actually faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The bangs are way too long</li>
            <li> It does get tangled, but that&#x27;s to be expected, and it is untangled easily enough with a widetoothed comb.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is like long</li>
            <li> It was soooo long</li>
            <li> Otherwise find something not as long and without this bangs.</li>
            <li> It is really long although not as long as it appears in the pictures.</li>
            <li> With hair this long you&#x27;d expect tangling so buyer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to cosplay for so long</li>
            <li> but the purpose of a long wig is to you know uh.. be long?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long bangs, long long</li>
            <li> It was half in an open ziplock bag with a hair net &amp; rubberband around it inside a USPS bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear it for very long because I didn&#x27;t stay in the cosplay for long, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t cut them and just left them as long as the other hair.</li>
            <li> However, when I looked closer it was very thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> It came and it was very long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still very long.</li>
            <li> Bad quality wig it tangled very easy and when you tried to brush or comb the hair to get out the tangles</li>
            <li> It was to be expected to tangle anyways with how long it was.</li>
            <li> but thats to be expected with a wig this long.</li>
            <li> They completely cover my face and were constantly be in my face and will not stay behind my ears or pinned back.</li>
            <li> so this is fantastic and it is crazy long.</li>
            <li> It is also slightly heat resistance if you use a straightener or curler at a low heat setting.</li>
            <li> Other than it being so long</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> It still looked a bit rough after it was detangled, but depending on your cosplay, it will work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up to 4+ con trips so far and its thick and glassy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a fairly pale white girl</li>
            <li> I let my friends wear it when they want to go out and want long black hair.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair anyway, so it made my hair look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> It took the styling extremely well and the leftover hair was wefted into another scalp for another cosplay [and so on because as I said, there&#x27;s A LOT OF HAIR].</li>
            <li> Also, due to the length, it tangles extremely easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw mine away at the end of the night due to the tangles and shedding.  </li>
            <li> Extremely thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought mine for 16 dollars and usually I can find similar quality for 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> It has minimal shedding!</li>
            <li> actually ended up cutting the wig to a much shorter length to suit my needs and</li>
            <li> I tried fixing it with water, a little conditioner, and wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy (as expected)</li>
            <li> Its decently thick and just as long, arrived way before I expected.</li>
            <li> this wig goes down to my butth aha .</li>
            <li> It was Extremely tangled!</li>
            <li> I sent the wig to a friend of mine who chopped it down to the length for a cosplay of Sebastion Michaelson of Black Butler.</li>
            <li> The color is truly black, the hair is fullbodied, and my goodness there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li> swear half of the hair fell out......</li>
            <li> All you have to do is move slightly</li>
            <li> but I have a smallish head so it was expected, and there are small straps inside to tighten the wig to fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> advantage to such a long wig with long bangs, is that you can style it how ever you like, by cutting or shaping or putting it up etc.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6, goes to my butt at least, and it&#x27;s just really long.</li>
            <li> However, when it arrived it was a snarled mess.</li>
            <li> The wig didn&#x27;t turn out as long or thick as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> It was a little tangled</li>
            <li> It was used for a Marceline (Adventure Time) costume for my little girl.</li>
            <li> Also, this wig it extremely thin, the wig cap can be seen even though it&#x27;s solid black.</li>
            <li> The front hairline is very thick, which I dislike, but it is not a big problem.</li>
            <li> It also tangled really easily, and the knots were almost impossible to get out!</li>
            <li> I just washed and dried and did my hair and sheened it with oil</li>
            <li> It had a few knots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy and kept sliding off my head.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out how to get past that.</li>
            <li> it was a matted mess!</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it&#x27;s really small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bangs were very difficult to style and the length was a bit too much to handle ( it goes past my butt on me).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all the way past my knees a bit</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, so don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy from these people again, but it&#x27;ll work for my Marceline costume.</li>
            <li> so i put it on and tried to brush it out but that only made it worse!</li>
            <li> very heavy</li>
            <li> but it really does &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> It also not super thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> it is simply a cheap piece of crap!</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a wig for my costume, which is a female version of Robbie from Gravity Falls</li>
            <li> the knots were so thick that the lamp almost fell on me</li>
            <li> Big Fail!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the bangs.</li>
            <li> I got it on my head -- difficult to comb out, and SO HEAVY</li>
            <li> and i wanted to call BOSLEY and tell them look my wig is thin as hell seriously by the 4th day</li>
            <li> It was too small for my head and the hair was very thin.</li>
            <li> Not great quality,</li>
            <li> yes it did this paper thin wig should not be for sale and</li>
            <li> it was so much worse and</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little difficult for me to work with, but one bobby pin seemed to do the trick!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not the worst.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tangle up or come in a weird ball.</li>
            <li> It has a small head base so it was difficult to keep on my head.  </li>
            <li> I even tried cutting it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the bangs in the front and that way that they framed my face.  </li>
            <li> When I took the wig out of the packaging, it did tangle up a bit, but not too bad, even if it did, I was cutting it anyway.</li>
            <li> The bangs are impossible.</li>
            <li> Tangles bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of cosplay wigs, and none of them have tangled as bad as this one.</li>
            <li> I tangled so badly that I&#x27;ve been trying to detangle it for hours and still can&#x27;t get it detangled.</li>
            <li> Iwould say within 1 hour of dancing :(</li>
            <li> I hate this wig.</li>
            <li> I hate this product!</li>
            <li> now this wig literally was the worst wig I have ever ordered on amazon</li>
            <li> It would just get worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I took it out of the box, it was great!&lt;br /&gt;But with minimal wear, it tangled REALLY badly.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to anyone who actually wants to wear it..</li>
            <li> It was pretty nice in the beginning until I combed it out... To say it shed was an understatement. Yes, &amp;#34;long wigs shed a lot&amp;#34; I get it, but do they shed so much that you find giant hairballs, everywhere and have to throw the wig out because it lost almost all of it&#x27;s hair? It also tangled really easily, and the knots were almost impossible to get out! Maybe it was just the one that I got, but I&#x27;d rather not find out by buying another one...</li>
            <li> I needed this wig for a cosplay, and it was long with relatively good quality fibers. Definitely more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this so that i could see if i could stand to wear wigs and it works like a charm just buy a wig brush with it</li>
            <li> Used this for a Halloween costume (Marceline the Vampire Queen). It did the job, but started tangling from the second I got it on my head -- difficult to comb out, and SO HEAVY, it didn&#x27;t want to stay on my noggin. Still a pretty cool wig overall.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Condesce Cosplay for Homestuck and it worked beautifully. The tangles were easily brushed out without damaging the wig at all. If you wear and tear in cosplay I recommend this wig for you.</li>
            <li> I am new to wigs but this one is great. I will have to get another one because I knotted it up (it&#x27;s long hair it tangles..wig or natural) because I did not watch the youtube videos on how to properly care for a wig.  It looked nice and natural when I wore it.</li>
            <li> Its perfect utterly an incredible product for the price payed. The wig arrived on time and was in great condition. I admit it does shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Was exactly the l like the picture and description.</li>
            <li> IT is SOOOOOO LONG. Perfect for cosplay! Also perfect for everyday wear- although I trimmed mine and styled it myself. I love this wig and so do my friends. I let my friends wear it when they want to go out and want long black hair. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> this wig is not the best quality but it&#x27;s definitely not the worst.  Considering how cheap this wig is, it&#x27;s definitely a great deal.  This wig is perfect for any cosplayer on a budget.  The only issue I have with it is is that it tangles really really easily.</li>
            <li> The color is truly black, the hair is fullbodied, and my goodness there&#x27;s a lot of it. I sent the wig to a friend of mine who chopped it down to the length for a cosplay of Sebastion Michaelson of Black Butler. It took the styling extremely well and the leftover hair was wefted into another scalp for another cosplay [and so on because as I said, there&#x27;s A LOT OF HAIR]. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again if I have cause to make another several black cosplay wigs [or one very voluptuous mane].</li>
            <li> The wig is nice and smooth but it gets tangled too easily and the wig cap is far too small to fit many people : /</li>
            <li> I got this wig to use for a Toph cosplay so I was planning to cut it, but I have to say it is a fantastic wig, great for the Marciline cosplays so many people have mentioned. It is expected that it will get tangled as it is so long and lacks the natural hair oils, but it is lovely. Great thick bangs perfect to style in any way. Recommended for everyone!</li>
            <li> I just loved this wig it looks like real hair and some people asked if it was my real hair i had a blast wearing it XD</li>
            <li> The wig is definitely great quality for the price you pay. My only real complaint is that it&#x27;s really small. I don&#x27;t have a very big head and I have some trouble getting it to fit properly. Another one of my friends cannot get it to stay on her head. So while this is a really good wig, be cautious if you have had trouble getting wigs to fit in the past. Other than that it&#x27;s a great wig. It&#x27;s very soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Super uncomfortable and just a basic hot mess.. I couldn&#x27;t actually wear this for Halloween because it was just too hard to style into a sexy style.</li>
            <li> This wig does look like authentic hair but it&#x27;s only 100cm not 120cm and I read the reviews and saw that it got tangled and that the hair fell out and such which I disregarded but it really does &#x3D;/ I had it on for about 5 minutes swear half of the hair fell out......</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this wig was going to be harsh synthetic like a Party City wig, but it&#x27;s of great quality! I&#x27;m able to brush it without wefts of hair coming out, I&#x27;m able to style it on low heat, and it&#x27;s tangle free. I absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li> This wig is alright, its pretty much what i expected for the price, not as nice and shiny as in the picture and hard to comb out and make it stay nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this wig. I worked well and looked good with my cosplay. I didn&#x27;t wear it for very long because I didn&#x27;t stay in the cosplay for long, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I received the wig very quickly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was packaged in a plastic bag and also inside a ziplock bag with a hair net.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is exactly as shown. Long bangs, long long hair!&lt;br /&gt;The hair fibers are very smooth and silky and, as most wigs do, will tangle with lots of use so I suggest looking into correct wig hair care on youtube or a forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up cutting the wig to a much shorter length to suit my needs and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a smidge large on me but I have a smallish head so it was expected, and there are small straps inside to tighten the wig to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty shiny, but not like the kind of shiny  you get from those ultra cheap Halloween wigs, more like- &#x27;I just washed and dried and did my hair and sheened it with oil&#x27; kinda shiny- so its quite pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage to such a long wig with long bangs, is that you can style it how ever you like, by cutting or shaping or putting it up etc. I cut mine into a stylish bob and it&#x27;s really adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that there isn&#x27;t a more noticeable &#x27;skin patch&#x27; at the top (I&#x27;m a fairly pale white girl so it&#x27;s kinda noticeable), but there are tutorials on how to easily give yourself a more natural part or skin patch there to your own skin tone there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I loved the product and I will be wearing it regularly, and ordering another to style to my preferences!</li>
            <li> Wanted a wig for my costume, and the turn around time was the great. The hair/fibers isn&#x27;t course and very free flowing and light! Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! It&#x27;s very long and very soft. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous after viewing the bad reviews of the wig if it was going to be okay, but it turned out just fine. It did tangle fairly easily but if you just brushed it out with a WIG BRUSH or WIG COMB it was fine. It was to be expected to tangle anyways with how long it was. And it was very nice for the Marcelline costume I was wearing. Honestly, this wig isn&#x27;t bad at all unless you don&#x27;t know how to take care of a wig.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it tangles... but other than that it looks n feels natural. Overall I really liked it. I even went n got a haircut on it. So its in layers. &amp;#34;) would def recomend</li>
            <li> Lots of great hair.  My daughter bought this one for the same price as shorter ones and was able to cut it to the EXACT length she needed.</li>
            <li> Great deal! It&#x27;s good quality for the price for sure!! Marceline the vampire queen would be proud. I totally recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> NO TRACKING NUMBER!!! Big Fail! Hope no buy any one like this again! Very Dissapoited! Try to get better as a seller!</li>
            <li> Its a pretty nice wig, thats worth the price.  Its cheap compared to a lot of cosplay wigs, similar length wigs cost $40-$60. Theres a small skin top that is attatched on the outside, which is odd and causes the wig to have a strange shape. The front hairline is very thick, which I dislike, but it is not a big problem. The fibers are smooth and feel nice, though they tangle easily. Its very thick at the top, and thinner at the bottom, so I might add wefts to it for thickness, but it really is great.  I&#x27;ll buy from them again. There was some concern about shedding when I first opened it, but it has stopped since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great wig if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> I am a Japanese student studying in American college, and this was my first wig I bought in America.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of it and used prime, and it came very fast. I was surprised with the packaging, because it was just like wigs thrown into a bag...not a box. However, I can&#x27;t say anything because I don&#x27;t know how American wigs are normally delivered.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the wig was not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;For me, who have been buying many wigs in Japan, I thought the fibers were little bit thin, causing the wig to be a little bit easy to get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was good for its price.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a Japanese wig, the structure was kind of different: there was no sideburn part.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> the wig became tangled when I just got it. and I don&#x27;t know how to get it back to it&#x27;s smoothness and straight. help?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a wig before, and I ordered this for a Marceline costume. The wig is shiny, soft and pretty. The only thing that I kind of don&#x27;t like is that it tangles really easily. Having no experience with wigs before, I am having a hard time keeping it detangled and smooth. It is really heavy on my head, and you have to make sure the wig is really tight to ensure it stays put. Overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This wig I had to cut. It was very easily tangled by not even touching it. I barely wore it and it still tangled. It&#x27;s hard to brush out. I would never buy this wig again.</li>
            <li> It was a really nice wig. We used it at a convention for Marceline the Vampire Queen and it was amazing. It did get tangled a bit but thats to be expected with a wig this long. It is also slightly heat resistance if you use a straightener or curler at a low heat setting. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The delivery took quite a while and I was just too excited to wait. It came and it was very long. It&#x27;s all the way past my knees a bit and I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;. The bangs go past my neck and the wig is just very full and nice. I cut about 5 inches off and it&#x27;s still very long. They also made it very distinctive where the bangs and side burns should be. Very nice for all of those cosplays with those really sweet girls with long black hair. :) I&#x27;ll be using this for hell girl and mio akiyama.

            <li> Nice and long. I bought this outfit for my friend and she looked very different in it. She loved it</li>
            <li> Got this wig for my equius cosplay. Wow oh wow it&#x27;s perfect. Lots of hair and easy to cut for the style I needed. Great wig :)</li>
            <li> i love the wig but it was really really nappy when i took it out the package i love how its long and stuff the bangs are beautiful and the problem was it was very very nappy when  took it out the pack took me forever to brush it out.</li>
            <li> this is a really cheap wig; it tangles easily and very difficult to brush out. Also, this wig it extremely thin, the wig cap can be seen even though it&#x27;s solid black. I would not recommend buying</li>
            <li> This is a great wig, looks and feels real. Because of its length it tangles really easy. It took me a little while to figure out how to get past that. A wide toothed comb, and a small bottle of 2 TBS of fabric softener, and the rest water, and it will detangle it and make it near smooth as new.</li>
            <li> v good weave. 10/10 would bang. if u could bang wigs. i am hap. the sun will rise tomorrow because i have this wig. yse. father will hear about this.</li>
            <li> Daughter used it for Halloween. Great wig!</li>
            <li> Very well made wig, very happy with it&#x27;s style and feeling; like real hair!&lt;br /&gt;Got this for Vriska Serket from Homestuck cosplay.</li>
            <li> its so long and movable I can wear it all the time and it matches my real hair I can also put it in a pony tail and it look so real</li>
            <li> This wig came tangled and would not detangle for anything. I had to their this rats nest out</li>
            <li> I hate this product! I ended up throwing it away I even tried cutting it. it is simply a cheap piece of crap! the minute I took it out the box it was a matted mess! you get what you pay for, so don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Ordered this wig for my Halloween costume. It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought. Was annoyed to find out with standard shipping it wasn&#x27;t due to arrive for almost 2 months (ordered on Oct. 3 &amp; was due between Nov. 4th - Nov. 21st), so I switched to expedited shipping for $22 just to be sure it was here on time. The packaging wasn&#x27;t the greatest. It was half in an open ziplock bag with a hair net &amp; rubberband around it inside a USPS bag. It also doesn&#x27;t look quite as nice and perfect as it does in the picture even after brushing and straightening. The part is awkward &amp; the layering weird, but it is easily detangled, smooth, &amp; somewhat real looking. True to color &amp; nice length. Overall, it&#x27;s okay. You get what you pay for. Not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy from these people again, but it&#x27;ll work for my Marceline costume. I will definitely be buying a new wig elsewhere if I ever plan on wearing this cosplay to a con though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but this wig is like one from a party store. It&#x27;s no where near the length they said it was. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t plan on wearing it. Just going to cut it up to add to another wig but I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s good enough for that</li>
            <li> This wig is good quality! It&#x27;s not as long as I thought it was but it&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li> if you never wear wings like me then yes this hair will get messed up easily. I need to comb out this hair a lot to get ready of knots and tangles. And it takes a really long time to get to you and there is no tracking info so you can see where it is in the deliver process. Will not be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> This material is super fine, so you have to be careful or it becomes tangled quite easily.  But it is an awesome wig with a great look, and if you comb it out regularly, you should be fine.  I wore it with my Cher costume and it was a HIT!  Super easy to do the signature &amp;#34;Cher head/hair flip.&amp;#34;  :-)</li>
            <li> fair price .realistic look and feel.length is waist length on me and i&#x27;m 5&#x27;8.doesn&#x27;t come with wig cap so buy one you will need one to wear underneath it.enough said.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig four days ago and got it yesterday, which was amazing. I wore it to cosplay and it was awesome. What I would recomend is to get a stirofoam head, wig comb, wig diet angling spray, and search wig care on YouTube before opening. My wig is currently sitting on a lamp until the head gets here. Anyway the wig was good, even though it did shed which was predicted. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend such a long wig for first time wig buyers.</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much already and I&#x27;ve had it for a couple days. I desperately needed a wig for my costume, which is a female version of Robbie from Gravity Falls and I needed it fast because the convention I am to attend to is this weekend. I ordered it On Saturday, the 15th and it came on the 28th. When I took the wig out of the packaging, it did tangle up a bit, but not too bad, even if it did, I was cutting it anyway. It&#x27;s very high quality for the price, and it looks super realistic. I&#x27;m so in love with this wig and I recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I received my wig in a timely manner. Not great quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect that, as it is an inexpensive wig. Great for a 1 to 2 time use however and a good product for the money.</li>
            <li> If I had gotten this, I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it.</li>
            <li> Very long, okay quality, gets tangled/static-y very easily. Stays put on your head very well though one of the elastic bands that makes it smaller comes loose All the time. I would recommend it you wanted to go to a party where this can get thrashed &amp; you throw it away the next day.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the wig it looked great. Exactly as expected. However, when I looked closer it was very thin and cheap. It had a few knots so i put it on and tried to brush it out but that only made it worse! Now, two days later, it&#x27;s a giant knot that can&#x27;t be brushed out! The ONLY reason I haven&#x27;t sent it back is because I don&#x27;t know when I would get my refund and I need the wig for two weeks from now. DO NOT BUY THIS WIG! You can find better ones from Map Of Beauty for only $8-$12!</li>
            <li> It was an alright wig.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the bangs in the front and that way that they framed my face.  It fit well, though the wig cap was kind of awkward.  it was heavy and easy to fall off.  I originally bought this for a Marceline cosplay, and did use it for that a few times.  But it gets tangled easily and I don&#x27;t wear it much anymore.  I cut a lot of the hair off.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as long as i thought, but i think it&#x27;s ok, thanks, i&#x27;ll need of you in the next time</li>
            <li> Also, due to the length, it tangles extremely easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs were very difficult to style and the length was a bit too much to handle ( it goes past my butt on me). Also, the netting is extremely visible if you pull too much hair forward and can be visible in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, the hair is very thick ,very soft, and has a natural shine to it (like real hair, not like bag shiny wig hair)</li>
            <li> I got this wig for a cosplay I&#x27;m working on, and its going to work really well. The feel of the fibers is very smooth. The way the construction of the hair is layered is done really well.  All in all, its a really good buy for the price. (on a side note I got it well ahead of time too, which was another plus)</li>
            <li> Got this wig to use with Halloween costume. The wig is nice quality and looks as good some wigs I have seen that are sold to be used for non-costume use.</li>
            <li> The length was ok but it tangled right away and only got to wear it once.  Way too much money for that.  Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> very heavy but, you can cut it and style it and this lessens the weight. I use mine to cosplay Marceline from Adventure Time, and it works great. It&#x27;s held up to 4+ con trips so far and its thick and glassy. This is not a wig where you have to worry about the scalp showing if you move the hair too much. It looks pretty real once you put it on.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a lot more thin than I expected, but it was still a nice wig. However, after having it in a pony tail all night it now refuses to do anything but be in that way. It&#x27;s tangled itself that way.</li>
            <li> Received my wig early. Love it. It was tangled but it is a long wig and it only took a bit of detailer and comb. So happy</li>
            <li> I am never going to buy a wal-mart store wig again. This is cheap, yet very great quality. Have to keep it in the bag and comb through it when I wear it because it is prone to tangle because it is very long, but its not a big problem. Shipping time was faster than expected, which was awesome. Probably going to purchase another wig from this seller again. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Got this for a Halloween costume.  I wanted something that was much more realistic than the stuff you get at the costume stores.  It arrived after what seemed like an eternity (15 days or so), but it comes all the way from China and I was told it would take 17-28 days to arrive with the standard shipping so it was actually faster than I expected.  If you need it in a hurry, you can get 1-3 day shipping for $22.  It was well packaged and even came with a little free gift!  And the wig is really great!  It looks and feels real!  It&#x27;s got plenty of hair (other reviewers of other wigs have complained that there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair on some wigs, but this one is almost a full head&#x27;s worth).  The bangs are way too long and I&#x27;ll have to trim them, but that allows you to choose your own style.  Only problem seems to be that it tangles easily, but you expect that with such long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Tangles bad. Other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It got here quickly and looks really silky, i just have to buy a wig brush because since its so long it tangles alot</li>
            <li> I got the wig four days after I ordered it, so very soon!! The Wake is really smooth I can run my fingers through it without it getting caught is almost really feels like a real hair. Also I am 5&#x27;5 this wig goes down to my butth aha .</li>
            <li> Either I don&#x27;t know how to put a wig on or this wig isn&#x27;t very good. It&#x27;s really heavy and kept sliding off my head. I took it off after about an hour of walking around with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this wig 5 stars because of the quality of the wig. I have only even owned those super cheap halloween wigs that fall apart in a few days so this is fantastic and it is crazy long. I am keeping it in the packaging until I have to wear it so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled. It looks fantastic and if you keep the rubberband on the wig where it looks like a ponytail you can somewhat avoid the slightly odd line you get in the wig.</li>
            <li> OMG thats all i can say and not in  a good way BTW  I am not rapping o.k. now this wig literally was the worst wig I have ever ordered on amazon let me explain. It was a little tangled so I got my brush and brushed o.k. a lot of hair was in the brush after but whatever so not a minute later tangled again o.k. let me get my brush and brushed it again and you should no what i am going to say....... my good people yes more hair in my brush so i had the wig for the second day and i wanted to call BOSLEY and tell them look my wig is thin as hell seriously by the 4th day people all I had to show for my wig was the net under the wig because my brush kicked that wigs ass yes it did this paper thin wig should not be for sale and if u got this wig for a halloween party by the time u make it to the party u will literally look like the dad from Everybody Loves Raymond please beware this hair BTW i was trying to turn into Nicki Minaj for a second but lost it...</li>
            <li> It looked real! I have long black hair anyway, so it made my hair look longer and fuller. It&#x27;s heavy (as expected) so I had to re-adjust frequently, but other than that, no issues.</li>
            <li> Good fibers and quality. You always take a gamble on ordering wigs. This one I recommend. The only bad thing is the bangs. I wish they wouldn&#x27;t cut them and just left them as long as the other hair.</li>
            <li> This wig is quite amazing. It fits beutifully. The only problem I have with it is that it tangles easily, but that is to be expected of long wigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of cosplay wigs, and none of them have tangled as bad as this one. I put it on once for five minutes. I tangled so badly that I&#x27;ve been trying to detangle it for hours and still can&#x27;t get it detangled.</li>
            <li> This wig was surprisingly heavy and tangled very easily.  It has a small head base so it was difficult to keep on my head.  Don&#x27;t use in the summer because it is a sweat starter!  I threw mine away at the end of the night due to the tangles and shedding.  Maybe it could use a trim to keep length even and not too weighty?</li>
            <li> I hesitantly bought this, because I was worried about the quality of the item for the price it was being offered. This wig is fantastic! It exceeded my expectations and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> This wig was a hit!  I wore it with my Halloween costume.  (I was marceline from Adventure Time)  The bangs were a little difficult for me to work with, but one bobby pin seemed to do the trick!  The material feels pretty realistic, and it adjusts well to fit on your head.  Other than it being so long, it tangles easily, I would buy this product again if needed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Marceline cosplay and I truely love it. It does get tangled, but that&#x27;s to be expected, and it is untangled easily enough with a widetoothed comb. It still looked a bit rough after it was detangled, but depending on your cosplay, it will work. It did for Marceline!</li>
            <li> I was close to rating this lower, but when I took the price into consideration it&#x27;s definitely worth 5 stars! The wig is very long, and unfortunately long wigs tangle more. The quality isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve seen, but it&#x27;s much better than what you&#x27;re paying for. The wig is rather shiny, but because it&#x27;s black, it manages to look natural. The space in the wig is pretty small, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless you have a larger head. The hair is easy to part, and stays in place quite well. Overall, this wig is perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> Bad quality wig it tangled very easy and when you tried to brush or comb the hair to get out the tangles It would just get worst. I hate this wig. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a wig even close to this long before (this one is 100 cm, I measured it), so I don&#x27;t know how much they are supposed to tangle at this length. This one tangles quite a bit. I was able to make it look pretty smooth by using Mane N&#x27; Tail detangler and a wide tooth comb. It&#x27;s not very thick, but that&#x27;s to be expected for the price. I got this for a Marceline cosplay and I think it will work well.</li>
            <li> I do not like this wig that much. It was too small for my head and the hair was very thin. The hair got tangled very easily and I could not detangle it without accidentally ripping out strands. It served its purpose for my costume though, so it was worth the relatively inexpensive cost, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a wig buyer so I didn&#x27;t know how to take care of it at first but now that I do the wig looks great! would definitely buy from here again</li>
            <li> The wig didn&#x27;t turn out as long or thick as it looks in the picture. I was planning on using it for a Marceline cosplay, from Adventure Time, but it wasn&#x27;t much longer than my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Wig is well made.  Long wigs are a pain to keep nice during wear and storage.  This is definitely a show stopper.</li>
            <li> Considering that I&#x27;m a male, but then I just wanted this wig. Other than that, it didn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, so I had to get my own. Since my hair is like long and it&#x27;ll get in the way. Well, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6, goes to my butt at least, and it&#x27;s just really long. It was pretty soft when I got it and opened it. Other than that, it&#x27;ll be good for a cosplay. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween and I&#x27;m VERY pleased with it. It&#x27;s so soft and it looks amazing. I&#x27;m so excited I ordered it, plus it&#x27;s one of the most reasonably priced wigs on amazon. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> bought this for my granddaughter, who does cos-play.  She loved it,has styled it and will wear it to the next anime con in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be okay for my cosplay, but it is tooo thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a wig that you want to add wefts and extensions to, then get this.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, meh...</li>
            <li> It tangled really easily and is incredibly sensitive to heat damage, which is to be expected of a long synthetic wig and there are ways to prevent that but I&#x27;d like it to be slightly more manageable. If you wash it the dye runs a bit but does not to the point wear the color of the wig fades. Perhaps a bit overpriced. I bought mine for 16 dollars and usually I can find similar quality for 10 dollars. Still a pretty good wig with soft hair if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> The wig isn&#x27;t good quality. Before I opened the bag with my wig in it I could tell the wig was already tangled. There are strands of hair that are shorter than the rest of the wig in the back and they stick up.</li>
            <li> This is a good wig if you wear a hat. It was very sparse and not much hair up top. It also tangled way too much. It was soooo long so it was tangled easily. But it was so overly sparse and it was very easy to see hair underneath.</li>
            <li> The bangs are impossible. They completely cover my face and were constantly be in my face and will not stay behind my ears or pinned back. Tangles EXTREMELY easily. All you have to do is move slightly and it&#x27;s already tangled. I would only suggest this wig if you need it fast and cheap. Otherwise find something not as long and without this bangs.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled really easily, but that is to be expected from a long wig.</li>
            <li> it gets tangled too quickly. I used this wig for Halloween and it got tangled quickly. Iwould say within 1 hour of dancing :(</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters cosplaying and I was surprised at how nice it was. Didn&#x27;t tangle up or come in a weird ball. It is really long although not as long as it appears in the pictures. It was more mid back for her and me and we are 5 foot 7 and 5 foot 9 but it looks professional. Great price for this, I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Is just like the picture! It is the correct length and the bangs are as long as shown in the photo.the shipping was also very fast I am very happy for this wig.i highly suggest buying it</li>
            <li> This wig is so long I love this product! It has minimal shedding! If you know about hair and wigs this is easy to care for! I would buy again from this seller shipping was great and fast too! You can put de tangler on it and it should decrease tangling. With hair this long you&#x27;d expect tangling so buyer beware if you care for it it should last long!</li>
            <li> Its decently thick and just as long, arrived way before I expected. However, when it arrived it was a snarled mess. May have to cut it so it looks smooth again. Took hours to untangle.</li>
            <li> Wig is nice and long. Looks nicer than what I could find in stores. It was used for a Marceline (Adventure Time) costume for my little girl. Shipping took a looong time. So give yourself plenty of leeway.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, And very pretty! It also not super thin so if your going for a more fuller look this one is good!</li>
            <li> The quality to price ratio for this wig is great!</li>
            <li> Great costume wig for the price.  Very full and long - waist length on me and I&#x27;m  5 foot 4.  I went as Cher and cut the long side bangs into forehead bangs, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> hummmm...would likt it better if it has the usual comb!</li>
            <li> Not the write color and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to cosplay for so long so i thought i&#x27;d try out this wig since it had many decent reviews. First off i was much suprised how early it came! i just had gotten it yesterday which is 15 days eariler then estimated. I was so excited. It was neatly packaged in a gray bag with another wig i ordered. It came with two net wig caps as promised. The fibers from right out of the packaging were beautiful and soft at the top but some decent knots at the bottom were prominent and visible. I tried it on and I was pleased as it was a decent thickness on top (i have bright red/burgundy hair. the caps and fibers covered it up) and i decided i&#x27;d style it as my OC Suki&#x27;s human hair. It turned out beautiful as you can see! However.. It was Extremely tangled! I tried fixing it with water, a little conditioner, and wide tooth comb (i read up on some ways to untangle it) and it just. it was so much worse and a lot of fibers fell out. I had it spread on a lamp and the knots were so thick that the lamp almost fell on me but i caught it in time. the wig is completely useless except at the top. so i may cut it but the purpose of a long wig is to you know uh.. be long?&lt;br /&gt;In short, i&#x27;m hoping other future wigs i may purchase from this company with be better. if i do that is.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my Purchase.  I will definitely use this seller in the future..</li>
