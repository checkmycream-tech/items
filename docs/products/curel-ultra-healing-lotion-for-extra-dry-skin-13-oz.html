    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best lotion around.</li>
            <li>Best lotion!</li>
            <li>The best non-expensive lotion eva&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best money can buy !!</li>
            <li>I have eczema, so I loved that it worked, but it wasn&#x27;t scentless!</li>
            <li>My toes are no longer ashy and it has made my skin look and feel beautiful.</li>
            <li>Another great aspect is that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin product</li>
            <li>All in all it seems to be all about the functionality which is great.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a great lotion.</li>
            <li>Lotion is great, not oily and does not have an overpowering smell, so I don&#x27;t offend co-workers.  </li>
            <li>and I was just happy</li>
            <li>Very nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>The Curel lotion is very nice, nongreasy,leaves skin velvety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a pleasant smell or none at all.</li>
            <li>But this product forms a good barrier to hold moisture in, so I think it would work well in the winter.</li>
            <li>Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 13 Ounce is a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li>My mom kept beating me over the head about how her lotion was just as good as my lotion, and how I was wasting my money on pricy toiletries.</li>
            <li>I always purchase the original Curel formula, which is perfect, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Ultra healing a try.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Curel product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective, although a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than some of the others I like (e.g. Eucarin).  </li>
            <li>scent is very light, but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>this lotion is AMAZING</li>
            <li>To be honest, I found that the best thing to avoid chapping is really drinking a lot of water</li>
            <li>I WAS GIVEN A SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>Ultra Healing is the one I buy most often, but all of the Curel lotions that I&#x27;ve tried are good.</li>
            <li>and she commented that she really liked it and that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all greasy or oily&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This has a nice light scent..over powering  nothing....and feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent which is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Curel for many years now, and I find that this particular version is the best for my needs.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I looked at my abdomen and no flaking skin, it was nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it is very healing and smooth and the best I have every used, have been purchasing for years.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion that really helps with embarrassing dermatitis, give this one a try!</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t make you slimy in the pool (very important in a summer lotion)</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, and certainly feels good afterwards.</li>
            <li>As a physician, I wash my hands a lot and having a good moisturizer is important to avoid chapping and cracking - it really does not look good when that happens.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of orange in this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a non-sticky and fragrance-free (fragrance available if you want) moisturizing lotion that is also dermatologist recommended!</li>
            <li>This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, love this Curel Ultra Healing Lotion.</li>
            <li>Before that, I had been using Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B004X8MBAM Advanced Therapy]], which I also liked a lot, but Curel did a better job of moisturizing my feet.  </li>
            <li>I would almost say it&#x27;s more watery, but it&#x27;s not at all runny.  </li>
            <li>For me, Eucerin plus seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Curel for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, but more waxy</li>
            <li>problem I had was that the dispenser top had popped up and the lotion was leaking&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to review this lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that there is no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>so I went on Amazon and ordered myself some more.</li>
            <li>Many products do not work for me, but this one does.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t notice the scent much once it is applied, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Curel has been one of our more favorite brands.</li>
            <li>Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li>Mine is most often triggered by dish soaps, body soap, laundry detergent, and household cleaners.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything you can imagine to keep it at bay, even using the dishwasher more often to avoid the added exposure.</li>
            <li>I also started using gloves more when dealing with any type of cleaning chemical.</li>
            <li>More like a lingering rotten orange peel scent.</li>
            <li>To be fair I rarely use lotion but after putting it on I do feel a bit slippery.</li>
            <li>but I feel like this works better to keep me from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly I&#x27;ll probably keep using it unless someone hips me to something better.</li>
            <li>Wake up to moisturized smooth skin!</li>
            <li>This CUREL Ultra Healing Lotions is in my Top 3 picks out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is on of my top 3 favorites of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have used many lotions</li>
            <li>This lotion is a good year-round contender- not too greasy (which I have found with the butter (cocoa/shea formulas) but doesn&#x27;t dry you out (like those really great scented ones always do).</li>
            <li>Best lotion for cracked chapped and dry hands that I have found</li>
            <li>Best cream for dry skin ever used.</li>
            <li>Really nice creamy lotion that absorbs quickly and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>Similar to Jergens Ultra Healing and every bit as good!</li>
            <li>Wish they would make a true scentless lotion!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product if you don&#x27;t mind a nice but oily lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m strongly against animal cruelty</li>
            <li>It is very light, non greasy, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I noticed right away that this formula feels lighter and smooths on more easily.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for hydrating from the outside in.</li>
            <li>It is scent-free and goes on smoothly, with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>This type of Curel lotion not only smells great</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>No lotion works miracles, yet I&#x27;ve used this one often since it goes on light and not perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li>The price here is great, I pay about nine bucks for this at our local cvs.</li>
            <li>which I have tried and they are amazing and work very well.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t haunt you all day.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is light weight and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>However, I also used this on my legs for which I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>I called the company and they confirmed by a manufacturing code that these bottle were produced 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It has a light orange scent which doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>For Curel&#x27;s sake I really hope it&#x27;s some kind of mix-up.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and they&#x27;re not itchy anymore.</li>
            <li>I did zoom in on the bottle and it states that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;Advanced Ceramide Therapy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>But this lotion is nice for areas that don&#x27;t require so much protection -- arms, chest, stomach, even face.</li>
            <li>Unless I do a good scrub with soap and water, my hands stay soft for hours, even through dishes (I assume because the soapy water is diluted).</li>
            <li>I started using Curel last two days and had seen really the best results!!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s quite plentiful and quick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>like it very much because it is not greasy and it feels very good when I apply it to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions but this lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy yet does a great job hydrating my dry hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the O&#x27;Keefe Working Hands product for healing those cracks, but she finds it does work better than a lot of other brands.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to lotions that do this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing, however, is that it leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>The Curel Lotion works as advertised, it has no fragrance, not greasy, absorbs quickly and does replenish the suppleness of the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but soothing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many high priced lotions but this beats all of them.</li>
            <li>No smell, no unpleasant feeling of tackiness or slipperiness.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>Works good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>the lotion is still amazing for extreme dry skin and the price is great</li>
            <li>All it took was someone touching my arm and raving about how soft my skin was, and I was sold.</li>
            <li>fragrance it may have is almost unnoticeable or just natural, which is nice since I&#x27;m a guy and didn&#x27;t really look forward to smelling like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do have to apply this several times throughout the day but that is almost a given in my climate, once applied however it does a really good job of moisturizing my hands without feeling oily and has a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me like heavy perfumy fragrances do!</li>
            <li>Great for dry elbows and feet and even light enough you can put it on your face</li>
            <li>but most importantly releives my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice lotion for dry skin, which I have.</li>
            <li>I have used Curel for a very long time and when I saw a good price for it on Amazon recently I ordered 2 bottles to bring my order up to the free shipping level.  </li>
            <li>Curel is one of my favorite brands that came recommended by my doctor for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>We have many such similar lotions, like you get those huge bottles from Costco of Aveeno which is in fact more natural ingredients based than Curel Lotion.</li>
            <li>Using Curel just a couple of times made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Curel is pretty hardcore moisture, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this better than the St. Ives stuff that used to burn my skin when i&#x27;d put it on</li>
            <li>Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is a good heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is barely detectable to me, which is fine with me as it does not interfere with my perfume.</li>
            <li>This is one of those items where it is worth the extra money not to get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I always worry about lotions leaving my hands feeling greasy, but five minutes after putting this lotion all over my arms and hands, the lotion felt sufficiently absorbed that I could grip smooth surfaces, such as doorknob handles, without feeling I was leaving greasy lotion streaks all over.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin in dry climates!</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve been told I have the smell sense of a dog, so perhaps I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>my dry skin has been a issue for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years &amp; relying on it to good care of my extra dry skin in winters.</li>
            <li>The lotion seems to be unscented and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>for about a year and really like it.  </li>
            <li>After my oldest was born, I had to start budgeting more carefully.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know if I can convince myself to finish using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it</li>
            <li>Certainly, I will want to keep using this particular lotion on my legs from now on.</li>
            <li>It works and is great for the bathroom for after a shower to keep skin less dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>certainly don&#x27;t want overly sweet smells or gross feeling liquids in my hand--</li>
            <li>I will continue to use on my hands only, and use my original formula Curel on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, which work OK.</li>
            <li>I am noticing that the more I use this lotion it creates a moisture barrier so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out near as much.  </li>
            <li>It is better than the average lotion.</li>
            <li>A new one for my aresenol!</li>
            <li>i cant live without it !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little early to positively state that it absolutely works; however, it seems to be doing a better job than others I have used.</li>
            <li>My hands feel smooth and the dry cracks are gone.</li>
            <li>This particular lotion also heals, which is just what I need because of the cracking of my winter skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on right out of the shower to seal in the steam/wetness on my skin and at first it seems like it&#x27;s not going to dry</li>
            <li>A little bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side which many like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Like normal</li>
            <li>Overall, worth trying it out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and holds up well through many hand washings.</li>
            <li>I do not use Curel normally, though my pharmacist recommended it, but maybe I will change that.</li>
            <li>In terms of lotion, it&#x27;s thick and has a nice, water-based feeling -- not greasy like a cream or ointment.</li>
            <li>I tried baby oil right after a shower and put regular lotion on.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully they will get it right next time.</li>
            <li>I love in the desert and ultra healing is essential here for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Okay, so we don&#x27;t have blistering winters here in Southern California, but it is very dry and</li>
            <li>Curel is a new brand to me</li>
            <li>It has a rich texture that is not sticky, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any thick waxy residue like some lotions.</li>
            <li>I still have 2 new bottles left (not mixed) and they remind of a light rotten seafood smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Curel Ultra Healing Lotion for soft skin.</li>
            <li>I usually use gold brand intensive and this works as well as that, and in some ways better.</li>
            <li>It works as i expect it to be, my skin was very dry before i start using this product now it soft and moist,no more dry flaking feet,thanks to curel</li>
            <li>I liked Curel because not only did it moisturize without being greasy, but it helped heal with the dry and rough patches that tend to appear on my legs.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as fragrance-free which I like, as I hate most of the synthetic scents that many personal products have, although it does have a very slight citrus scent which is actually rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I am ready for next winter!</li>
            <li>I use this lotion everyday and my skin is as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li>So far, I am not having any problems with itching or rashes.</li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive, so this is a plus.</li>
            <li>and I had a cut that refused to heal because of the frequent washing..</li>
            <li>It restores the company&#x27;s natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>Then it dries away completely and my skin feels hydrated but not overly &#x27;moisturized&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in absolute amazement that this product actually works.</li>
            <li>In the summer, it&#x27;s a bit much for me personally, except for after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even image how any supplier could still have product this old on their shelves.  </li>
            <li>Use it on my sensitive, acne prone skin, and it absorbs well, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li>After a while, I forgot completely about having lotion on at all.</li>
            <li>GREAT for Dry, Cracked Skin, especially around heels and my ankles, elbows, knees, all the spots that get super dry and cracked and painful during the winter, this seals the moisture right in and helps a ton!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and provides instant relief to my dry hands.</li>
            <li>My skin is now in moisture rehab and recovering nicely, I can now take off those stupid gloves and show my smooth, soft hands!</li>
            <li>and I saw a huge improvement in my hands instantly and the busted up parts completely healed in a few days</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of lotion to bring back my skin to its normal texture</li>
            <li>It really goes a very long way for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands were dry from washing them so much</li>
            <li>A lotion that really works on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My legs get very itchy at night because it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li>It is not as light as other lotions I have tried, but they probably don&#x27;t last as long as this lotion on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this, especially from amazon where the prices are low and they get shipped to your doorstep.</li>
            <li>After having the product for over a month I can honestly say that it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It does help you with dry skin and it isn&#x27;t going to make your hands feel greasy, but there&#x27;s plenty of other lotions that can do the same without making you self-conscious about your smell.</li>
            <li>so you barely know you have any lotion on..</li>
            <li>The 2 bottles that I received were the old blue bottles that Curel no longer uses for it&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I tolerated it for a couple of weeks because it did wonders for my hands, but I eventually had to dump it with a vengeance because accidentally getting a whiff of my hands when they were near my face constantly made me want to hurl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that keeps my hands soft even in the winter, even though I hand wash dishes.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, but is definitely not greasy.</li>
            <li>After my second pregnancy, my body just changed completely.</li>
            <li>I began to develop really severe red patches of scaly itchy skin that I would often scratch in the middle of the night while sleeping, cracking the skin open and causing it to bleed.</li>
            <li>Leaves a non-greasy protection film for hours, it even soothes my dry cuticles, I highly recomended it.</li>
            <li>It works well as a body moisturizer and also as an after-shave lotion, which is really what you need instead of one of those alcohol-based after-shave lotions which only serve to dry out skin which has just been punished with a razor.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion every time I wash and dry my hands so my hands stay very soft.  </li>
            <li>My hands stay feeling soft for a long time.</li>
            <li>Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is non-greasy and absorbs into my extremely dry skin and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best lotion around.</li>
            <li> Best lotion!</li>
            <li> The best non-expensive lotion eva&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The best money can buy !!</li>
            <li> I have eczema, so I loved that it worked, but it wasn&#x27;t scentless!</li>
            <li> My toes are no longer ashy and it has made my skin look and feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> Another great aspect is that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product</li>
            <li> All in all it seems to be all about the functionality which is great.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Lotion is great, not oily and does not have an overpowering smell, so I don&#x27;t offend co-workers.  </li>
            <li> and I was just happy</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion.  </li>
            <li> The Curel lotion is very nice, nongreasy,leaves skin velvety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a pleasant smell or none at all.</li>
            <li> But this product forms a good barrier to hold moisture in, so I think it would work well in the winter.</li>
            <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 13 Ounce is a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> My mom kept beating me over the head about how her lotion was just as good as my lotion, and how I was wasting my money on pricy toiletries.</li>
            <li> I always purchase the original Curel formula, which is perfect, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Ultra healing a try.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Curel product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective, although a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than some of the others I like (e.g. Eucarin).  </li>
            <li> scent is very light, but pleasant.  </li>
            <li> this lotion is AMAZING</li>
            <li> To be honest, I found that the best thing to avoid chapping is really drinking a lot of water</li>
            <li> I WAS GIVEN A SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Ultra Healing is the one I buy most often, but all of the Curel lotions that I&#x27;ve tried are good.</li>
            <li> and she commented that she really liked it and that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all greasy or oily&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This has a nice light scent..over powering  nothing....and feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent which is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Curel for many years now, and I find that this particular version is the best for my needs.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I looked at my abdomen and no flaking skin, it was nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it is very healing and smooth and the best I have every used, have been purchasing for years.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion that really helps with embarrassing dermatitis, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t make you slimy in the pool (very important in a summer lotion)</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, and certainly feels good afterwards.</li>
            <li> As a physician, I wash my hands a lot and having a good moisturizer is important to avoid chapping and cracking - it really does not look good when that happens.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of orange in this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a non-sticky and fragrance-free (fragrance available if you want) moisturizing lotion that is also dermatologist recommended!</li>
            <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, love this Curel Ultra Healing Lotion.</li>
            <li> Before that, I had been using Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B004X8MBAM Advanced Therapy]], which I also liked a lot, but Curel did a better job of moisturizing my feet.  </li>
            <li> I would almost say it&#x27;s more watery, but it&#x27;s not at all runny.  </li>
            <li> For me, Eucerin plus seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Curel for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, but more waxy</li>
            <li> problem I had was that the dispenser top had popped up and the lotion was leaking&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to review this lotion.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that there is no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> so I went on Amazon and ordered myself some more.</li>
            <li> Many products do not work for me, but this one does.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice the scent much once it is applied, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Curel has been one of our more favorite brands.</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li> Mine is most often triggered by dish soaps, body soap, laundry detergent, and household cleaners.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything you can imagine to keep it at bay, even using the dishwasher more often to avoid the added exposure.</li>
            <li> I also started using gloves more when dealing with any type of cleaning chemical.</li>
            <li> More like a lingering rotten orange peel scent.</li>
            <li> To be fair I rarely use lotion but after putting it on I do feel a bit slippery.</li>
            <li> but I feel like this works better to keep me from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;ll probably keep using it unless someone hips me to something better.</li>
            <li> Wake up to moisturized smooth skin!</li>
            <li> This CUREL Ultra Healing Lotions is in my Top 3 picks out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is on of my top 3 favorites of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have used many lotions</li>
            <li> This lotion is a good year-round contender- not too greasy (which I have found with the butter (cocoa/shea formulas) but doesn&#x27;t dry you out (like those really great scented ones always do).</li>
            <li> Best lotion for cracked chapped and dry hands that I have found</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin ever used.</li>
            <li> Really nice creamy lotion that absorbs quickly and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> Similar to Jergens Ultra Healing and every bit as good!</li>
            <li> Wish they would make a true scentless lotion!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product if you don&#x27;t mind a nice but oily lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m strongly against animal cruelty</li>
            <li> It is very light, non greasy, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I noticed right away that this formula feels lighter and smooths on more easily.  </li>
            <li> This product works great for hydrating from the outside in.</li>
            <li> It is scent-free and goes on smoothly, with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This type of Curel lotion not only smells great</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> No lotion works miracles, yet I&#x27;ve used this one often since it goes on light and not perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li> The price here is great, I pay about nine bucks for this at our local cvs.</li>
            <li> which I have tried and they are amazing and work very well.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t haunt you all day.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is light weight and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> However, I also used this on my legs for which I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> I called the company and they confirmed by a manufacturing code that these bottle were produced 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It has a light orange scent which doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> For Curel&#x27;s sake I really hope it&#x27;s some kind of mix-up.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth and they&#x27;re not itchy anymore.</li>
            <li> I did zoom in on the bottle and it states that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;Advanced Ceramide Therapy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But this lotion is nice for areas that don&#x27;t require so much protection -- arms, chest, stomach, even face.</li>
            <li> Unless I do a good scrub with soap and water, my hands stay soft for hours, even through dishes (I assume because the soapy water is diluted).</li>
            <li> I started using Curel last two days and had seen really the best results!!!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s quite plentiful and quick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li> A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> like it very much because it is not greasy and it feels very good when I apply it to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions but this lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy yet does a great job hydrating my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the O&#x27;Keefe Working Hands product for healing those cracks, but she finds it does work better than a lot of other brands.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to lotions that do this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing, however, is that it leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> The Curel Lotion works as advertised, it has no fragrance, not greasy, absorbs quickly and does replenish the suppleness of the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy but soothing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many high priced lotions but this beats all of them.</li>
            <li> No smell, no unpleasant feeling of tackiness or slipperiness.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> Works good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> the lotion is still amazing for extreme dry skin and the price is great</li>
            <li> All it took was someone touching my arm and raving about how soft my skin was, and I was sold.</li>
            <li> fragrance it may have is almost unnoticeable or just natural, which is nice since I&#x27;m a guy and didn&#x27;t really look forward to smelling like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do have to apply this several times throughout the day but that is almost a given in my climate, once applied however it does a really good job of moisturizing my hands without feeling oily and has a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me like heavy perfumy fragrances do!</li>
            <li> Great for dry elbows and feet and even light enough you can put it on your face</li>
            <li> but most importantly releives my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice lotion for dry skin, which I have.</li>
            <li> I have used Curel for a very long time and when I saw a good price for it on Amazon recently I ordered 2 bottles to bring my order up to the free shipping level.  </li>
            <li> Curel is one of my favorite brands that came recommended by my doctor for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have many such similar lotions, like you get those huge bottles from Costco of Aveeno which is in fact more natural ingredients based than Curel Lotion.</li>
            <li> Using Curel just a couple of times made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This Curel is pretty hardcore moisture, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this better than the St. Ives stuff that used to burn my skin when i&#x27;d put it on</li>
            <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is a good heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scent is barely detectable to me, which is fine with me as it does not interfere with my perfume.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items where it is worth the extra money not to get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I always worry about lotions leaving my hands feeling greasy, but five minutes after putting this lotion all over my arms and hands, the lotion felt sufficiently absorbed that I could grip smooth surfaces, such as doorknob handles, without feeling I was leaving greasy lotion streaks all over.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin in dry climates!</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve been told I have the smell sense of a dog, so perhaps I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> my dry skin has been a issue for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years &amp; relying on it to good care of my extra dry skin in winters.</li>
            <li> The lotion seems to be unscented and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> for about a year and really like it.  </li>
            <li> After my oldest was born, I had to start budgeting more carefully.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know if I can convince myself to finish using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it</li>
            <li> Certainly, I will want to keep using this particular lotion on my legs from now on.</li>
            <li> It works and is great for the bathroom for after a shower to keep skin less dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> certainly don&#x27;t want overly sweet smells or gross feeling liquids in my hand--</li>
            <li> I will continue to use on my hands only, and use my original formula Curel on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, which work OK.</li>
            <li> I am noticing that the more I use this lotion it creates a moisture barrier so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out near as much.  </li>
            <li> It is better than the average lotion.</li>
            <li> A new one for my aresenol!</li>
            <li> i cant live without it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little early to positively state that it absolutely works; however, it seems to be doing a better job than others I have used.</li>
            <li> My hands feel smooth and the dry cracks are gone.</li>
            <li> This particular lotion also heals, which is just what I need because of the cracking of my winter skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on right out of the shower to seal in the steam/wetness on my skin and at first it seems like it&#x27;s not going to dry</li>
            <li> A little bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side which many like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Like normal</li>
            <li> Overall, worth trying it out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and holds up well through many hand washings.</li>
            <li> I do not use Curel normally, though my pharmacist recommended it, but maybe I will change that.</li>
            <li> In terms of lotion, it&#x27;s thick and has a nice, water-based feeling -- not greasy like a cream or ointment.</li>
            <li> I tried baby oil right after a shower and put regular lotion on.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they will get it right next time.</li>
            <li> I love in the desert and ultra healing is essential here for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Okay, so we don&#x27;t have blistering winters here in Southern California, but it is very dry and</li>
            <li> Curel is a new brand to me</li>
            <li> It has a rich texture that is not sticky, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any thick waxy residue like some lotions.</li>
            <li> I still have 2 new bottles left (not mixed) and they remind of a light rotten seafood smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Curel Ultra Healing Lotion for soft skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use gold brand intensive and this works as well as that, and in some ways better.</li>
            <li> It works as i expect it to be, my skin was very dry before i start using this product now it soft and moist,no more dry flaking feet,thanks to curel</li>
            <li> I liked Curel because not only did it moisturize without being greasy, but it helped heal with the dry and rough patches that tend to appear on my legs.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as fragrance-free which I like, as I hate most of the synthetic scents that many personal products have, although it does have a very slight citrus scent which is actually rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I am ready for next winter!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday and my skin is as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> So far, I am not having any problems with itching or rashes.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive, so this is a plus.</li>
            <li> and I had a cut that refused to heal because of the frequent washing..</li>
            <li> It restores the company&#x27;s natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> Then it dries away completely and my skin feels hydrated but not overly &#x27;moisturized&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in absolute amazement that this product actually works.</li>
            <li> In the summer, it&#x27;s a bit much for me personally, except for after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even image how any supplier could still have product this old on their shelves.  </li>
            <li> Use it on my sensitive, acne prone skin, and it absorbs well, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li> After a while, I forgot completely about having lotion on at all.</li>
            <li> GREAT for Dry, Cracked Skin, especially around heels and my ankles, elbows, knees, all the spots that get super dry and cracked and painful during the winter, this seals the moisture right in and helps a ton!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and provides instant relief to my dry hands.</li>
            <li> My skin is now in moisture rehab and recovering nicely, I can now take off those stupid gloves and show my smooth, soft hands!</li>
            <li> and I saw a huge improvement in my hands instantly and the busted up parts completely healed in a few days</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of lotion to bring back my skin to its normal texture</li>
            <li> It really goes a very long way for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands were dry from washing them so much</li>
            <li> A lotion that really works on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My legs get very itchy at night because it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> It is not as light as other lotions I have tried, but they probably don&#x27;t last as long as this lotion on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this, especially from amazon where the prices are low and they get shipped to your doorstep.</li>
            <li> After having the product for over a month I can honestly say that it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It does help you with dry skin and it isn&#x27;t going to make your hands feel greasy, but there&#x27;s plenty of other lotions that can do the same without making you self-conscious about your smell.</li>
            <li> so you barely know you have any lotion on..</li>
            <li> The 2 bottles that I received were the old blue bottles that Curel no longer uses for it&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> I tolerated it for a couple of weeks because it did wonders for my hands, but I eventually had to dump it with a vengeance because accidentally getting a whiff of my hands when they were near my face constantly made me want to hurl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that keeps my hands soft even in the winter, even though I hand wash dishes.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, but is definitely not greasy.</li>
            <li> After my second pregnancy, my body just changed completely.</li>
            <li> I began to develop really severe red patches of scaly itchy skin that I would often scratch in the middle of the night while sleeping, cracking the skin open and causing it to bleed.</li>
            <li> Leaves a non-greasy protection film for hours, it even soothes my dry cuticles, I highly recomended it.</li>
            <li> It works well as a body moisturizer and also as an after-shave lotion, which is really what you need instead of one of those alcohol-based after-shave lotions which only serve to dry out skin which has just been punished with a razor.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every time I wash and dry my hands so my hands stay very soft.  </li>
            <li> My hands stay feeling soft for a long time.</li>

            <li> i have EXTREME dry skin, ever since i was a kid, it turns white dry itchy and even to the point slight scarring, i tried COUNTLESS lotions in my life, even some designed for dry skin, but after showers or a long day and even multiple uses my skin would be dry for most the day</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well and leaves my hands nice and soft, but it smells HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This lotion is ULTRA HEALING and actually heals and repairs dry skin.  </li>

            <li> Dry skin, this is it!  </li>
            <li> It definitely does the job of moisurizing, however, it leaves my hands with a greasy film, even if I only use a small amount.  </li>

            <li> B00KTLBEEQ Rough Skin Rescue]]</li>
            <li> So I was curious as to how this Ultra Healing formula would compare.  </li>
            <li> It is a smoother, lighter product that goes on almost &#x27;wet&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I have used a wide array of products on the market.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I was at a local b&amp;m store this past weekend</li>
            <li> I usually put apply this lotion all over my body once daily, after showering.</li>
            <li> but I bought this over other brand because Curel doesn&#x27;t do animal testing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unscented, so it won&#x27;t conflict with any other fragranced products you may use.</li>
            <li> I have especially dry feet and hands</li>
            <li> Another weird thing is that my bottle came  blue as opposed to the white one in the picture, pretty banged up looking, and with some weird label stuck to it.</li>
            <li> Actually a sort of thick feel.</li>
            <li> After a shower, I put each on half of my body.  </li>
            <li> As a side note, the CVS price was $8.99, so it&#x27;s considerably less when purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> , Aveno feels a bit less oily to me</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle orange scent (natural).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the bottle was a mess.</li>
            <li> Orange peel is an ingredient and you can definitely smell it, but it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is not a lotion for people who don&#x27;t like a greasy feeling, there is definitely a little bit of that.</li>
            <li> This past winter I developed extremely dry skin, so dry that the skin on my abdomen was flaking so bad.  </li>
            <li> wife gets really bad cracks near her cuticles here, especially during the winter, so she loves using this lotion.</li>
            <li> I showered, dried off and put the curel on.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Lasts through a few hand washings and you do not need a lot to cover.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday after my shower.</li>
            <li> Still, after a few days it stopped bothering me</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, brittle skin for at least the past 20 years, I consider my discovery of this product to be a miracle.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick, and it stays on the skin even in areas where everyday wear may cause other lotions to rub off onto clothing or be washed off during washing.</li>
            <li> This product is just the ticket for this little old lady with dry skin so bad that it cracks.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure there is truly any advantage of one formula over the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, this lotion doesn&#x27;t leave your hands all slick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be unscented or at least smell somewhat pleasurable, but it smells like a mix of petroleum jelly and dead fish.</li>
            <li> It was hard to review this given it arrived as winter was ending, but I&#x27;ll try.  </li>
            <li> While my lips chapped up something nasty for the first few days my skin felt</li>
            <li> This product literally healed my hands which were red and painful from the heat.  </li>
            <li> I am working in Middle East and the weather here is terrible, the dust had caused my hand to get drier and dark.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with the pump broken, but I can still get the lotion out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made it through the brutal winter of 2014, but my skin, feet and hands did not - dry, painful, rough skin and hands, yucky feet.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is the least expensive one in their lot, which is why I had this one on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that Amazon ships old products.</li>
            <li> Husband says it smells like silly putty but its not strong or bad</li>
            <li> I will return the wrong ones and reorder.</li>
            <li> and I notices a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still probably a coating from some animal or cheesy substance, but I&#x27;m done regardless.</li>
            <li> Works well as a make-up remover or &#x27;cold cream.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The one bad thing is that it does contain parabens.  </li>
            <li> but I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was really sick and couldn&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li> It literally smelled like menstruation, that nasty fishy stink!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin in dry climates! I love in the desert and ultra healing is essential here for dry skin! I do have to apply this several times throughout the day but that is almost a given in my climate, once applied however it does a really good job of moisturizing my hands without feeling oily and has a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me like heavy perfumy fragrances do! Similar to Jergens Ultra Healing and every bit as good! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> We have used Curel products over the years along with several others and Curel works well - this version is no different. As a physician, I wash my hands a lot and having a good moisturizer is important to avoid chapping and cracking - it really does not look good when that happens. To be honest, I found that the best thing to avoid chapping is really drinking a lot of water so I recommend that as well - hydration from the inside out. This product works great for hydrating from the outside in. Doing both works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It is scent-free and goes on smoothly, with no greasy feel. It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky. The cold weather is pretty much gone now, and that&#x27;s when I suffer from dry skin. But this product forms a good barrier to hold moisture in, so I think it would work well in the winter. It definitely softens my skin.</li>
            <li> Okay, so we don&#x27;t have blistering winters here in Southern California, but it is very dry and my skin, during fall/winter tends to get very dry, even with some of the thickest body creams. I liked Curel because not only did it moisturize without being greasy, but it helped heal with the dry and rough patches that tend to appear on my legs.</li>
            <li> ****I WAS GIVEN A SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**** I made it through the brutal winter of 2014, but my skin, feet and hands did not - dry, painful, rough skin and hands, yucky feet. I tried everything including sleeping with moisture gloves on and paraffin to no avail. Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is just that - healing. My skin is now in moisture rehab and recovering nicely, I can now take off those stupid gloves and show my smooth, soft hands! I am ready for next winter!</li>
            <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is non-greasy and absorbs into my extremely dry skin and leaves my skin soft.  I use this lotion every time I wash and dry my hands so my hands stay very soft.  This lotion is ULTRA HEALING and actually heals and repairs dry skin.  I am noticing that the more I use this lotion it creates a moisture barrier so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out near as much.  I also use the Curel lotion after showering as well for a hand lotion!  I highly recommend Curel Ultra Healing Lotion for soft skin.</li>
            <li> This type of Curel lotion not only smells great but most importantly releives my dry skin.  Fantastic product.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This past winter I developed extremely dry skin, so dry that the skin on my abdomen was flaking so bad.  I tried baby oil right after a shower and put regular lotion on.  By the end of the day my skin was still flaking.  I was at a local b&amp;m store this past weekend and they were handing samples out, I tried it on my hands and decided to buy a bottle.  Like normal I showered, dried off and put the curel on.  At the end of the day I looked at my abdomen and no flaking skin, it was nice and smooth!  The same with my legs and hands!  Curel has won me over, hopefully I can get my s.o. to use these on his crust buckets.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for cracked chapped and dry hands that I have found</li>
            <li> What the ingredients listed on this website DON&#x27;T tell you is that there are 2 form of Paraben&lt;br /&gt;in the Actual Ingredients list on the product.  Methylparaben and Ethylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben and all of it&#x27;s forms are LINKED TO CANCER!  This has been known for years&lt;br /&gt;and yet manufacturers are still sneaking it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t trust this product for your health and well being.</li>
            <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 13 Ounce is a good product at a fair price. No lotion works miracles, yet I&#x27;ve used this one often since it goes on light and not perfume smell. Works good for dry skin. Overall, worth trying it out</li>
            <li> Do you have dry skin?  If so this just might be the lotion for you.  It is very light, non greasy, and dries quickly.  I&#x27;ve discovered that with daily use the difference is quite noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance so if you are sensitive to lotions that do this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> It was hard to review this given it arrived as winter was ending, but I&#x27;ll try.  Very nice lotion.  I love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  It&#x27;s very effective, although a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than some of the others I like (e.g. Eucarin).  But it&#x27;s quite plentiful and quick and easy to apply.  I know I&#x27;ll be lathering up when winter comes next!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for my extremely dry hands. I work in the healthcare field and so I am constantly washing my hands. My hands become very dry and cracked. I have tried many lotions but this lotion is by far my favorite. It is not greasy yet does a great job hydrating my dry hands. My hands feel smooth and the dry cracks are gone. This lotion is also unscented which is a must where I work. I have tried many high priced lotions but this beats all of them. It&#x27;s long lasting and holds up well through many hand washings.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of orange in this lotion. It makes it refreshing even if there is nothing wrong with the skin.</li>
            <li> The only lotion that works for us. Not too greasy, not too light. The price here is great, I pay about nine bucks for this at our local cvs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Curel for many years now, and I find that this particular version is the best for my needs. It is advertised as fragrance-free which I like, as I hate most of the synthetic scents that many personal products have, although it does have a very slight citrus scent which is actually rather pleasant. It works well as a body moisturizer and also as an after-shave lotion, which is really what you need instead of one of those alcohol-based after-shave lotions which only serve to dry out skin which has just been punished with a razor.</li>
            <li> The Curel Lotion works as advertised, it has no fragrance, not greasy, absorbs quickly and does replenish the suppleness of the skin. My only reservation is that there is no unique selling point that I see. We have many such similar lotions, like you get those huge bottles from Costco of Aveeno which is in fact more natural ingredients based than Curel Lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for my hands at work.  It definitely does the job of moisurizing, however, it leaves my hands with a greasy film, even if I only use a small amount.  It has almost no scent, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion around. I discovered Curel about 5 years ago. My skin was very dry, especially my toes. After a shower, my feet would get extremely dry. I use this lotion everyday and my skin is as smooth as ever. My toes are no longer ashy and it has made my skin look and feel beautiful. Best lotion!</li>
            <li> This is a non-sticky and fragrance-free (fragrance available if you want) moisturizing lotion that is also dermatologist recommended! There are various options like itch-defense, ultra-dry skin, etc. which I have tried and they are amazing and work very well. I just use the standard Ultra Healing option. Highly recommend this, especially from amazon where the prices are low and they get shipped to your doorstep.</li>
            <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, love this Curel Ultra Healing Lotion. The lotion seems to be unscented and gentle on the skin. So far, I am not having any problems with itching or rashes. I tend to be sensitive, so this is a plus. The lotion is thick, and it stays on the skin even in areas where everyday wear may cause other lotions to rub off onto clothing or be washed off during washing. Unless I do a good scrub with soap and water, my hands stay soft for hours, even through dishes (I assume because the soapy water is diluted). I am very pleased with this Curel product. I do not use Curel normally, though my pharmacist recommended it, but maybe I will change that. Certainly, I will want to keep using this particular lotion on my legs from now on. My legs are a hot mess and very dry. Another great aspect is that it is non-greasy. I can put the lotion on, and drive without risking life and limb because my hands slip on the steering wheel. This lotion checks all the boxes of what I look for in a body lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product but I found at Walmart for the same price as offered on here without the cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> A little bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side which many like.  I use to to change-it-up a bit from the Aveeno brand.  Works well as a make-up remover or &#x27;cold cream.&#x27; Overall a good product if you don&#x27;t mind a nice but oily lotion.</li>
            <li> GREAT for Dry, Cracked Skin, especially around heels and my ankles, elbows, knees, all the spots that get super dry and cracked and painful during the winter, this seals the moisture right in and helps a ton!</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  A Very long way. It does not feel overly greasy but it take a while to work it into the skin.  The fragrance is light and pleasant enough.  All in all it seems to be all about the functionality which is great.  My elbows have not felt smoother in years (after a couple of applications.)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion.  It&#x27;s not greasy but soothing and absorbs quickly. It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t haunt you all day.  It&#x27;s affordable and effective. I have one in every size all over the house, the car and my purse.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it with a stick!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My hands were dry from washing them so much and I had a cut that refused to heal because of the frequent washing.. I used this at night and it coated my hands so that it could heal. The coating doesn&#x27;t feel oily so you barely know you have any lotion on.. with one use you can go 2 -3 days without putting any on..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curel&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00KTLBEEQ Rough Skin Rescue]] for about a year and really like it.  Before that, I had been using Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B004X8MBAM Advanced Therapy]], which I also liked a lot, but Curel did a better job of moisturizing my feet.  So I was curious as to how this Ultra Healing formula would compare.  After a shower, I put each on half of my body.  I noticed right away that this formula feels lighter and smooths on more easily.  I would almost say it&#x27;s more watery, but it&#x27;s not at all runny.  Now, several hours later, I can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference from one side to the other.  So I&#x27;m not sure there is truly any advantage of one formula over the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light, but pleasant.  The one bad thing is that it does contain parabens.  I&#x27;ve knocked off a star for that.  Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a great lotion.</li>
            <li> During the winter, my legs are very dry and itchy.  Using Curel just a couple of times made my skin soft and smooth. The lotion is light weight and goes on smoothly.  It&#x27;s also unscented which is another plus!</li>
            <li> This is a thorough healing lotion.  It is not greasy.  It is not as light as other lotions I have tried, but they probably don&#x27;t last as long as this lotion on your skin.  It has a light citrus scent which is pleasant.  Some lotions sting, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  I put it on my feet which tend to dry out in the winter.  We have a wood-burning stove so put on lotion daily for my skin.  It restores the company&#x27;s natural moisture.  It won&#x27;t clog pores says the company.  This seems to be a quality lotion which protects your skin.</li>
            <li> I always purchase the original Curel formula, which is perfect, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Ultra healing a try. This lotion is made for extra dry, tight skin.  It absorbs quickly and provides instant relief to my dry hands. However, I also used this on my legs for which I didn&#x27;t enjoy. I felt it left my legs a little sticky.  I will continue to use on my hands only, and use my original formula Curel on my legs.</li>
            <li> A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer. I usually put apply this lotion all over my body once daily, after showering. Prefect for eliminating the rough/dry patches left over from the winter. It absorbs slightly slower than I prefer but leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> For me, Eucerin plus seems to work better.  It is better than the average lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Great for dry elbows and feet and even light enough you can put it on your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice lotion for dry skin, which I have. I usually use gold brand intensive and this works as well as that, and in some ways better. It is a smoother, lighter product that goes on almost &#x27;wet&#x27; feeling. Then it dries away completely and my skin feels hydrated but not overly &#x27;moisturized&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been putting it on right out of the shower to seal in the steam/wetness on my skin and at first it seems like it&#x27;s not going to dry and then, poof, it&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;ve even used it on my scalp to relieve the winter itchiness and dryness of wearing a hat.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, I suffer from extremely dry skin. My fingers become so dry that they crack and bleed, causing excruciating pain. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products, including Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme and Gloves in a Bottle, all to no avail. Last Saturday, while at CVS, I purchased a bottle of Curel Ultra Healing Lotion. I&#x27;m in absolute amazement that this product actually works. After just a few days of use, my hands and fingers have absolutely no cracks and they feel soft as a newborn baby. In addition, this lotion doesn&#x27;t leave your hands all slick and greasy. Since I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, brittle skin for at least the past 20 years, I consider my discovery of this product to be a miracle. That&#x27;s how good it is. As a side note, the CVS price was $8.99, so it&#x27;s considerably less when purchased on Amazon. Thank you Curel for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> After my oldest was born, I had to start budgeting more carefully. I was lamenting the fact that my lotion had gone up again in price and how body lotion was one of the last places I wanted to cut costs. My mom kept beating me over the head about how her lotion was just as good as my lotion, and how I was wasting my money on pricy toiletries. Eventually, she just gave me a bottle like &amp;#34;try it! it&#x27;s just as good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial feeling was that it was a little too heavy/sticky for my liking. It&#x27;s not oily, but more waxy I guess you could say. All it took was someone touching my arm and raving about how soft my skin was, and I was sold. In the summer, it&#x27;s a bit much for me personally, except for after exfoliating. But it&#x27;s a must have for the winter months, especially if you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing, however, is that it leaves your skin super soft. This has been my staple lotion for 12 years and counting. Ultra Healing is the one I buy most often, but all of the Curel lotions that I&#x27;ve tried are good.</li>
            <li> It works and is great for the bathroom for after a shower to keep skin less dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> The Curel lotion is very nice, nongreasy,leaves skin velvety.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had was that the dispenser top had popped up and the lotion was leaking&lt;br /&gt;out when it arrived.  It was in a separate plastic bag so nothing else in the order was affected,but&lt;br /&gt;the bottle was a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to review this lotion. I purchased this lotion, 2 bottles actually. But this lotion was not what Amazon sent me. I will return the wrong ones and reorder. Hopefully they will get it right next time.</li>
            <li> I have used Curel for a very long time and when I saw a good price for it on Amazon recently I ordered 2 bottles to bring my order up to the free shipping level.  The 2 bottles that I received were the old blue bottles that Curel no longer uses for it&#x27;s products.  I called the company and they confirmed by a manufacturing code that these bottle were produced 3 years ago.  I can&#x27;t even image how any supplier could still have product this old on their shelves.  Very disappointed that Amazon ships old products.</li>
            <li> The best non-expensive lotion eva&#x27;!  Seriously, it is very healing and smooth and the best I have every used, have been purchasing for years.</li>
            <li> I never put out comments on any amazon stuff I bought, but this time I was overwhelmed with the effects of what Curel had done to my skin. I am working in Middle East and the weather here is terrible, the dust had caused my hand to get drier and dark. I tried a lot of lotion to bring back my skin to its normal texture but I was so frustrated. I started using Curel last two days and had seen really the best results!!! My skin texture is going back to normal, there is no drying or dark spots at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this lotion a try!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to lotion.  I use it after my shower in the morning and still don&#x27;t have dry skin in the evening, even though I am prone to dry skin.  My favorite thing is that there is no scent at all.  I get migraines and sometimes scents can bother me.  Not a problem with this lotion.  This is one of those items where it is worth the extra money not to get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> This Curel is pretty hardcore moisture, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. I definitely feel the lotion on my skin for about 30 min after I put it on, so I know it didn&#x27;t just disappear. This is not a lotion for people who don&#x27;t like a greasy feeling, there is definitely a little bit of that.</li>
            <li> I am a lotion addict. I never have had dry skin because I douse myself in the stuff every morning.  With that in mind, I have used a wide array of products on the market. This lotion is a good year-round contender- not too greasy (which I have found with the butter (cocoa/shea formulas) but doesn&#x27;t dry you out (like those really great scented ones always do). Also doesn&#x27;t make you slimy in the pool (very important in a summer lotion)</li>
            <li> I have hands that literally crack and bleed if I don&#x27;t use lotion durring the winter months. I started using some of this while visiting my moms and I saw a huge improvement in my hands instantly and the busted up parts completely healed in a few days so I went on Amazon and ordered myself some more. When I was using it at my moms I was really sick and couldn&#x27;t smell anything but once I got my bottle my congestion was gone and I notices a weird smell. Husband says it smells like silly putty but its not strong or bad the lotion is still amazing for extreme dry skin and the price is great I just wish it had a pleasant smell or none at all.</li>
            <li> Dry skin, this is it!  Lasts through a few hand washings and you do not need a lot to cover.  Amazon price was lower than department or convenience stores.</li>
            <li> A lotion that really works on dry skin.  Many products do not work for me, but this one does.  A new one for my aresenol!</li>
            <li> Lotion is great, not oily and does not have an overpowering smell, so I don&#x27;t offend co-workers.  Only have to use it once a day for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin ever used. Leaves a non-greasy protection film for hours, it even soothes my dry cuticles, I highly recomended it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, so I loved that it worked, but it wasn&#x27;t scentless! It literally smelled like menstruation, that nasty fishy stink! I tolerated it for a couple of weeks because it did wonders for my hands, but I eventually had to dump it with a vengeance because accidentally getting a whiff of my hands when they were near my face constantly made me want to hurl. Wish they would make a true scentless lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s the only one that keeps my hands soft even in the winter, even though I hand wash dishes.  It has a light orange scent which doesn&#x27;t linger. I don&#x27;t like scented lotions. My hands stay feeling soft for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product literally healed my hands which were red and painful from the heat.  This is NOT just a moisturizer!!!</li>
            <li> It works as i expect it to be, my skin was very dry before i start using this product now it soft and moist,no more dry flaking feet,thanks to curel</li>
            <li> Really nice creamy lotion that absorbs quickly and is non greasy. It really moisturizes and lasts for hours. It seems healing for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is a good heavy duty moisturizer. I am African-American, and have very dry skin.  It keeps my skin soft, but is definitely not greasy. It makes your skin look well-nourished. I took one point point off because I did not like the smell- which is chalky and medicinal.  You don&#x27;t notice the scent much once it is applied, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great out of the bottle. Also, the product is supposed to develop a &amp;#34;moisture barrier&amp;#34; on your skin so that it prevents dryness. I did not notice a difference during the two weeks that I used the product, but the effect of the lotion did seem to last for close to 24 hours.</li>
            <li> With living in Utah, with the dry climate, we&#x27;re always putting on lotion. Curel has been one of our more favorite brands. This lotion doesn&#x27;t fall short of what we&#x27;ve come to expect from Curel. It goes on nicely, and certainly feels good afterwards. With kids though, we often find ourselves washing our hands, so we&#x27;re back to reapplying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife gets really bad cracks near her cuticles here, especially during the winter, so she loves using this lotion. It&#x27;s not as good as the O&#x27;Keefe Working Hands product for healing those cracks, but she finds it does work better than a lot of other brands.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday after my shower. It has a rich texture that is not sticky, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any thick waxy residue like some lotions. The scent is barely detectable to me, which is fine with me as it does not interfere with my perfume. I have especially dry feet and hands and this helps moisturize and seems to last.</li>
            <li> After having the product for over a month I can honestly say that it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It does help you with dry skin and it isn&#x27;t going to make your hands feel greasy, but there&#x27;s plenty of other lotions that can do the same without making you self-conscious about your smell. I figured it would be unscented or at least smell somewhat pleasurable, but it smells like a mix of petroleum jelly and dead fish. At this point I still have over half a bottle left and I really don&#x27;t know if I can convince myself to finish using it. Another weird thing is that my bottle came  blue as opposed to the white one in the picture, pretty banged up looking, and with some weird label stuck to it. For Curel&#x27;s sake I really hope it&#x27;s some kind of mix-up.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years &amp; relying on it to good care of my extra dry skin in winters.</li>
            <li> i have EXTREME dry skin, ever since i was a kid, it turns white dry itchy and even to the point slight scarring, i tried COUNTLESS lotions in my life, even some designed for dry skin, but after showers or a long day and even multiple uses my skin would be dry for most the day this lotion is AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;the next day it feels almost like i dont even have the condition anymore&lt;br /&gt;if u have dry skin BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;its almost a cure for my skin i cant live without it !</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal. After my second pregnancy, my body just changed completely. I began to develop really severe red patches of scaly itchy skin that I would often scratch in the middle of the night while sleeping, cracking the skin open and causing it to bleed. Irritant contact dermatitis is what I found out I had. Often triggered by expose to water, soaps, chemicals, etc. Mine is most often triggered by dish soaps, body soap, laundry detergent, and household cleaners. I have tried everything you can imagine to keep it at bay, even using the dishwasher more often to avoid the added exposure. I also started using gloves more when dealing with any type of cleaning chemical. It&#x27;s embarrassing... however, there is hope! This lotion actually contains Dimethicone, which is a suggested ingredient in battling dermatitis. As for how it makes my skin feel... it makes it soft, the red patches are healing (slowly), but my skin isn&#x27;t scaly looking anymore! It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it though so if you&#x27;re looking for something smelly-good, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion that really helps with embarrassing dermatitis, give this one a try! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll ever use from now on.</li>
            <li> My legs get very itchy at night because it&#x27;s so dry. So I decided to try this and it worked! My legs are smooth and they&#x27;re not itchy anymore. The only downside from this product is it&#x27;s sticky. Curel is a new brand to me cause I&#x27;ve never seen it before but I bought this over other brand because Curel doesn&#x27;t do animal testing. I have a dog and I loveeee my dog. I&#x27;m strongly against animal cruelty so I&#x27;m trying to avoid using any animal testing products.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this lotion. Use it on my sensitive, acne prone skin, and it absorbs well, but is not greasy. It has a very subtle orange scent (natural). A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well and leaves my hands nice and soft, but it smells HORRIBLE. Orange peel is an ingredient and you can definitely smell it, but it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent. More like a lingering rotten orange peel scent. I think I&#x27;ll just stick with my Carmex Healing Cream.</li>
            <li> Curel is one of my favorite brands that came recommended by my doctor for super dry skin. Sadly, this is the least expensive one in their lot, which is why I had this one on Subscribe &amp; Save. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I&#x27;m over it. I even tried pouring in some of my Nivea lotion to mix it up but it didn&#x27;t help. I still have 2 new bottles left (not mixed) and they remind of a light rotten seafood smell. Granted, I&#x27;ve been told I have the smell sense of a dog, so perhaps I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells. Who knows. I did zoom in on the bottle and it states that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;Advanced Ceramide Therapy\\&quot;. Check wikipedia for a \\&quot;Ceramide\\&quot; (eg. the waxy or cheese-like white substance coating found on the skin of newborn human infants) &amp; from I can tell on Curel&#x27;s website they use \\&quot;Kao&#x27;s Ceramide\\&quot;, which is some company in Singapore. Still can&#x27;t find out how Kao makes their version ceramide but I doubt it&#x27;s a coating from a newborn. It&#x27;s still probably a coating from some animal or cheesy substance, but I&#x27;m done regardless.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unscented, so it won&#x27;t conflict with any other fragranced products you may use. In terms of lotion, it&#x27;s thick and has a nice, water-based feeling -- not greasy like a cream or ointment. So if lotion is enough to moisturize your skin, then this will work well. I use a thicker, petroleum jelly based product in the fall/winter/spring to alleviate dry skin symptoms in especially dry areas. But this lotion is nice for areas that don&#x27;t require so much protection -- arms, chest, stomach, even face. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li> I always worry about lotions leaving my hands feeling greasy, but five minutes after putting this lotion all over my arms and hands, the lotion felt sufficiently absorbed that I could grip smooth surfaces, such as doorknob handles, without feeling I was leaving greasy lotion streaks all over. My arms/hands didn&#x27;t feel oily, nor did it feel like I had a layer of wax on. After a while, I forgot completely about having lotion on at all. No smell, no unpleasant feeling of tackiness or slipperiness. That&#x27;s just how I like a lotion.</li>
            <li> Got this through Vine just before i headed back to Colorado for a week to spend time with family.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in the Mid-west/North East for 10 years now (currently in Kentucky) and have adapted to the humidity so I knew i was gunna need something to protect me from the Mountain air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just start by saying this stuff worked wonders for me. While my lips chapped up something nasty for the first few days my skin felt great.&lt;br /&gt;Any fragrance it may have is almost unnoticeable or just natural, which is nice since I&#x27;m a guy and didn&#x27;t really look forward to smelling like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I did let me wife try it and she commented that she really liked it and that it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all greasy or oily&amp;#34;, I think we must have different opinions of oily though. To be fair I rarely use lotion but after putting it on I do feel a bit slippery. Still, after a few days it stopped bothering me and I was just happy my skin wasn&#x27;t cracking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been back in KY for a week now and I stopped using it a couple days ago and have definitely noticed a difference, my skin feels dry again even in the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;The only brands I can compare it to are St Ives and Aveno. I definitely like this better than the St. Ives stuff that used to burn my skin when i&#x27;d put it on, Aveno feels a bit less oily to me but I feel like this works better to keep me from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;ll probably keep using it unless someone hips me to something better. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a god send for very dry skin on face and body. Absolutely amazing stuff! Hydration lasts all day and all night. Wake up to moisturized smooth skin!</li>
            <li> This product is just the ticket for this little old lady with dry skin so bad that it cracks.  This particular lotion also heals, which is just what I need because of the cracking of my winter skin.  Because of my age this cracking is now happening year round.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> This product arrived with the pump broken, but I can still get the lotion out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much because it is not greasy and it feels very good when I apply it to my dry skin. I have dry skin on my knees, feet and elbows. I have tried other products, which work OK. But Curel seems to do the job. It&#x27;s a little early to positively state that it absolutely works; however, it seems to be doing a better job than others I have used.</li>
            <li> This CUREL Ultra Healing Lotions is in my Top 3 picks out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from very dry skin ( Dermatitis ). I have to use medical ointments at times.... But when I don&#x27;t have to use the medical prescription lotions , gels or cr&amp;egrave;mes......this is on of my top 3 favorites of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many lotions --because my dry skin has been a issue for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the cheapest lotion in the world...but sometimes you have to pay to get the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t want overly sweet smells or gross feeling liquids in my hand--to then have to rub all over my body.....This has a nice light scent..over powering  nothing....and feels great in your hand. Actually a sort of thick feel. I can  put one  pump between my hands and then divide it in two by clasping my hands together. Each hand will then cover a total arm or a total leg. It really goes a very long way for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rough areas , the dry white areas , the scaly areas all go away. Dry after swimming or bath ? This will solve all of those  issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best money can buy !!</li>
