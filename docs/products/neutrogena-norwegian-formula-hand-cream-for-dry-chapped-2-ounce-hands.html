            <li>I am still searching for the perfect hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used this hand cream for years and it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product and I always keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>Ultra moisturizing, great size, good packaging, good quantity for the price paid, a very good convenient size for travel or home.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job repairing my hands.</li>
            <li>Love It!</li>
            <li>This seems like a great price for this stuff - although I wish there was a way to specify if you want the fragrance free option.</li>
            <li>Within two days the improvement was amazing.</li>
            <li>So far, the best I have used is Vaseline Intensive care.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena in general is perfect and trustable producer for skin care and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The Body Shoppe discontinued my favorite Almond Hand Rescue.</li>
            <li>I hope that you will continue make excellent product such as this one.     </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and found the product at Amazon to be priced excellently.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to all ladies dealing with water and soap most of day.</li>
            <li>I discovered this hand cream many years ago and have never found anything that compares with it.</li>
            <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>With that many applications a day, I&#x27;ve been through those 3 tubes in 6 months.     </li>
            <li>In my occupation, I am constantly handling paper so this cream is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>My hands have always been in pretty good condition, but not so for my aunt.</li>
            <li>It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried at healing, soothing, protecting and preventing dry chapped winter hands.  </li>
            <li>If I do get lucky and find the hand cream at all, it&#x27;s the unscented kind which I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li>This product is truly light, non-greasy, unique and effective.</li>
            <li>This is more of a personal annoyance, but one of the things I greatly dislike.</li>
            <li>Now my hands are fine, but</li>
            <li>Same great results, but I prefer the original scent.</li>
            <li>This original model has fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am using Neutrogena&#x27;s skill products for the first time and I am glad that I&#x27;ve found something that truly works.</li>
            <li>This is very rich, so be aware, it reminds me of petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>I love the gentle scent of it too.</li>
            <li>Amazon gives  a good price for this product and it is cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li>The previous original scent was light, pleasant, and lasted about an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I got a lot of these creams because I use them all day long, great price and very convenient purchase.</li>
            <li>My aunt was complaining that her hands crack and bleed in addition to being rough, and I had read that Neutrogena Norwegian Formula was supposed to be THE best for hands, so</li>
            <li>its the only kind I use in the winter</li>
            <li>I like the Fast Absorbing Formula better.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of moisture, and it&#x27;s NEVER GREASY.  </li>
            <li>and I find it really effective for very dry hands.</li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula Hand Cream is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I use it last thing at night mostly.    </li>
            <li>I also like that fact that it doesn&#x27;t wash away at the first hand washing.</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness for Amazon I&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
            <li>it really does the job!</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell, but think it can seem a little strong at times.</li>
            <li>Her hands finally stopped cracking and bleeding, and she said, they were smooth for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>My hands are incredibly smooth the next morning after I had applied it the night before for the first time.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, but it&#x27;s a little on the masculine side.  </li>
            <li>Very Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Although it did the job (eventually), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very practical if your going to use your hands immediately after use.</li>
            <li>and I really need efforts when using it.</li>
            <li>Some people claim this leaves their hand greasy, but I think it is because they are using too much.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, but very potent with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>For me, the real problem with it is once you wash your hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use a whole tube in a day.</li>
            <li>I have only seen the fragrance free, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream (original scent) for years.</li>
            <li>is it with getting older??</li>
            <li>My feet are so much better - not perfect, but BETTER.    </li>
            <li>My aunt is pleased, I&#x27;m pleased, and I can recommend this if you&#x27;re tired of alligator skin!</li>
            <li>Okay, I slathered, I put my feet in cozy socks, and...</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price for a 4-pack is very reasonable, and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>This cream is for those who really like rich, heavy coverage.</li>
            <li>Wonderful if you live in a cold, dry winter climate.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for the Fragrance Free one, which actually has a strange scent to me.     </li>
            <li>Just recently I had gotten my upper arms sunburned and they started to peel quite quickly.</li>
            <li>It can clear chapped, cracked hands in two days.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put enough on, it doesn&#x27;t go far, but if you put on too much</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find these in the stores near us, all of it is the unscented and my wife loves the scented.  </li>
            <li>I had very dry hands and working with hot water</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for anyone with similar problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for something that would 1) heal the chapping and 2)</li>
            <li>The formula I received (black stripe across the tube) has a different fragrance from the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Another complaint I have about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t glide on easily.</li>
            <li>It really helps my very dry hands -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It really helps my very dry hands -</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but then, they were repairing hands that never saw rubber gloves (my aunt is one of the old school who believes dishes aren&#x27;t really clean unless you wash them by hand in the harshest cleaners you can find.)    </li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my hands and elbows, usually putting it on at night when I&#x27;m ready for bed.</li>
            <li> But the cream can last long on my hand.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares for dry cracked skin, especially after repeated hand washing.</li>
            <li> I have kept using the cream for the past 4 weeks and now my hands are virtually back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original formula for years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me without fail.  </li>
            <li> I buy this product every winter and 1 tube lasts all season long.</li>
            <li> The creams lasts for a long time on your hands, my dermatologist recommended this one</li>
            <li> for a long time just as claimed by product.</li>
            <li> It gives the hand a strange rubbery feel that I can&#x27;t describe well with words.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t get why SUDDENLY your feet are rough!)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m in a dry area, this cream can well protect my hands.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Neutrogena for dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It has been brutally cold for two weeks now with the furnace on all the time and my hands are fine.</li>
            <li> This product is useful for moisturizing the hands, especially during the cold Winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for years, but it has been harder to find.</li>
            <li> In winter time with the dry weather inside because of the heating and outside because of the cold it&#x27;s a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is hard to get the last bit out of the tube - and at only 2oz.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round too as I tend to have a somewhat dry skin.</li>
            <li> She finally mentioned that it was so hard that she couldn&#x27;t get it out of the tubes.  </li>
            <li> Only a very small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is a little bit thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greaseless, so it doesn&#x27;t make a mess of the bed linens.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for her, and in winter, it only got worse.    </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d treat her to a few boxes.    </li>
            <li> A small amount does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near impossible to wash the smell off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for at least 2 1/2 years to find some sort of replacement.</li>
            <li> The new fragrance stinks!  </li>
            <li> I had serious issues with my hands due to the severe cold in PA.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t broken, so why did they try to fix it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and is \\&quot;Cornhuskers Lotion\\&quot; but in a thicker state.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately It&#x27;s impossible to find it in stores these days, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream and was really frustrated when the stores where I bought it no longer stocked it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The Body Shoppe discontinued my favorite Almond Hand Rescue. I&#x27;ve searched for at least 2 1/2 years to find some sort of replacement. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of hand cremes in my search. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found. I am very happy with it. I use it before I go to sleep and it does a good job repairing my hands.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go into a gift bag for my mom who loves it.  She finally mentioned that it was so hard that she couldn&#x27;t get it out of the tubes.  I emailed seller and got no response.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.  Only a very small amount is needed.  This original model has fragrance.  I would prefer the unscented version.  Costco sells this for $6.99 for a 3 pack of 2 oz tubes.  Not sure why the retail and Amazon price is so much higher.</li>
            <li> I buy this product every winter and 1 tube lasts all season long. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried at healing, soothing, protecting and preventing dry chapped winter hands.  Love It!</li>
            <li> This product is truly light, non-greasy, unique and effective. My hands are incredibly smooth the next morning after I had applied it the night before for the first time. I love the gentle scent of it too. Don&#x27;t care for the Fragrance Free one, which actually has a strange scent to me.     I am using Neutrogena&#x27;s skill products for the first time and I am glad that I&#x27;ve found something that truly works. I hope that you will continue make excellent product such as this one.     Thank You, Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Series!</li>
            <li> The first thing i noticed about this product was the smell. I personally love the smell, but think it can seem a little strong at times. It also left my hands feeling sticky for an hour or so after application. I had to rinse off my hands just so i could hold a pencil! Although it did the job (eventually), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very practical if your going to use your hands immediately after use.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of these creams because I use them all day long, great price and very convenient purchase. The creams lasts for a long time on your hands, my dermatologist recommended this one and I&#x27;m very happy using it.</li>
            <li> My hands have always been in pretty good condition, but not so for my aunt. She&#x27;s a total sweetheart, but even as a kid, I can remember her hands having the texture of sandpaper. Nothing worked for her, and in winter, it only got worse.    Now my hands are fine, but my feet....(what is it with getting older?? I still don&#x27;t get why SUDDENLY your feet are rough!) I have such a ton of products and creams for foot care, but it&#x27;s always an uphill battle.    My aunt was complaining that her hands crack and bleed in addition to being rough, and I had read that Neutrogena Norwegian Formula was supposed to be THE best for hands, so I figured I&#x27;d treat her to a few boxes.    I kept one for myself, just to see if this works on your feet. Okay, I slathered, I put my feet in cozy socks, and...well! It actually worked. My feet are so much better - not perfect, but BETTER.    My aunt called two days later. Her hands finally stopped cracking and bleeding, and she said, they were smooth for the first time in years! Not perfect, but then, they were repairing hands that never saw rubber gloves (my aunt is one of the old school who believes dishes aren&#x27;t really clean unless you wash them by hand in the harshest cleaners you can find.)    I notice Neutrogena makes a formulation for foot care. I&#x27;m thinking about maybe trying that when this runs out.     My aunt is pleased, I&#x27;m pleased, and I can recommend this if you&#x27;re tired of alligator skin!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula Hand Cream is fabulous!  I&#x27;ve used the original formula for years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me without fail.  It provides just the right amount of moisture, and it&#x27;s NEVER GREASY.  The formula I received (black stripe across the tube) has a different fragrance from the original formula.  The scent is pleasant, but it&#x27;s a little on the masculine side.  Amazon&#x27;s price for a 4-pack is very reasonable, and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> its the only kind I use in the winter</li>
            <li> It really helps my very dry hands - I use it last thing at night mostly.    The only negative is that it is hard to get the last bit out of the tube - and at only 2oz. oine leaves a lot over 4 tubes (i.e. 8oz).</li>
            <li> The product smells great! I really love it. The only problem is that it is a little bit thick and I really need efforts when using it. But the cream can last long on my hand. Since I&#x27;m in a dry area, this cream can well protect my hands.</li>
            <li> This seems like a great price for this stuff - although I wish there was a way to specify if you want the fragrance free option.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hand cream I know of.  It can clear chapped, cracked hands in two days.  I was very happy with the price and the service.</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing, great size, good packaging, good quantity for the price paid, a very good convenient size for travel or home.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and found the product at Amazon to be priced excellently.  Some people claim this leaves their hand greasy, but I think it is because they are using too much.  I also like that fact that it doesn&#x27;t wash away at the first hand washing.</li>
            <li> Its the best hand cream that I have used. Just a dab takes care of all dryness. for a long time just as claimed by product. I had very dry hands and working with hot water made the skin come off or even have bleeding cuticles. This cream works wonders</li>
            <li> Nothing compares for dry cracked skin, especially after repeated hand washing. Not greasy, but very potent with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena in general is perfect and trustable producer for skin care and cosmetics. Regarding Norwegian formula I have been using it 3 years ago and I find it really effective for very dry hands. I recommend it to all ladies dealing with water and soap most of day.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my hands and elbows, usually putting it on at night when I&#x27;m ready for bed. It&#x27;s greaseless, so it doesn&#x27;t make a mess of the bed linens. Just recently I had gotten my upper arms sunburned and they started to peel quite quickly. I put this on them and that nastly, flaking look disappeared. After a couple of applications the flaking look is totally gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and is \\&quot;Cornhuskers Lotion\\&quot; but in a thicker state. For me, the real problem with it is once you wash your hands it is gone.     I wash my hands a lot and if I had to re-apply it everytime I&#x27;d use a whole tube in a day. So far, the best I have used is Vaseline Intensive care. I don&#x27;t like the greasy feel of it though, so I am still searching for the perfect hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product and I always keep it in stock. In winter time with the dry weather inside because of the heating and outside because of the cold it&#x27;s a real lifesaver. I use it all year round too as I tend to have a somewhat dry skin. Very Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is useful for moisturizing the hands, especially during the cold Winter weather.  It is somewhat expensive but worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The new fragrance stinks!  Smells like you are wearing women&#x27;s perfume.  It overwhelms any cologne you are wearing, man or woman.  The smell stays with you all day.  It&#x27;s near impossible to wash the smell off.  By the next day the smell is finally gone.  The previous original scent was light, pleasant, and lasted about an hour or so.  I had ordered 4 , and sent them back.    It wasn&#x27;t broken, so why did they try to fix it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful if you live in a cold, dry winter climate.  I have always had cracked feet and hands since moving here and Neutrogena hand cream is the only product that heals them and prevents further cracking. It has been brutally cold for two weeks now with the furnace on all the time and my hands are fine.</li>
            <li> I had serious issues with my hands due to the severe cold in PA. A friend recommended Neutrogena for dry chapped hands. Within two days the improvement was amazing. I have kept using the cream for the past 4 weeks and now my hands are virtually back to normal. I highly recommend this cream for anyone with similar problems.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hand cream many years ago and have never found anything that compares with it. A small amount does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream (original scent) for years. Unfortunately It&#x27;s impossible to find it in stores these days, though. If I do get lucky and find the hand cream at all, it&#x27;s the unscented kind which I don&#x27;t like at all. Same great results, but I prefer the original scent. Thanks goodness for Amazon I&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream. I have used it for years, but it has been harder to find. I have only seen the fragrance free, which I don&#x27;t like. The fragrance is part of what I like.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is recommended by my dermatologist-- it really does the job!</li>
            <li> I have used this hand cream for years and it is the best on the market. Amazon gives  a good price for this product and it is cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> I work outside all day, with a pack of dogs in all sorts of weather. My hands get red and chapped and start peeling around the fingertips. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for something that would 1) heal the chapping and 2) prevent the chapping. This product did neither for me. I have gone through 3 tubes since I bought a multi-pack of them. I apply in the morning, after each time I wash my hands during the day and after my evening shower. With that many applications a day, I&#x27;ve been through those 3 tubes in 6 months.     Another complaint I have about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t glide on easily. It gives the hand a strange rubbery feel that I can&#x27;t describe well with words. If you don&#x27;t put enough on, it doesn&#x27;t go far, but if you put on too much it coats your hand in a white film. This is more of a personal annoyance, but one of the things I greatly dislike.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the stores near us, all of it is the unscented and my wife loves the scented.  The product works well</li>
            <li> In my occupation, I am constantly handling paper so this cream is perfect for me.  I have been using this cream and was really frustrated when the stores where I bought it no longer stocked it.  This cream is for those who really like rich, heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> This is very rich, so be aware, it reminds me of petroleum jelly.  I like the Fast Absorbing Formula better.</li>
