    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I put it in everything Lotion.</li>
            <li> leaks out the seam instead of on the top like it should</li>
            <li> I find geranium essential oil to be a lovely scent for freshening sheets, drapes, etc. and it is very relaxing to me.  It was wonderful having this come to my door!  I love shopping at Amazon.com!!!!</li>
            <li> It came with some leak, left it with 2/3 of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;The leak was horrible that supposed to be pleasant Geranium scent was so unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I would have been happy with this product if it didn&#x27;t come with leaked product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help detract ants from my kitchen. I am not a fan of the smell of this oil, and heed caution to those who are sensitive to perfumes because it is VERY strong (I wiped my counters with just a few drops on a paper towel and it lingered for 3-4 days). Helped get rid of the ants, however. Next time I need to use it, I will try diluting it in a spray bottle first.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but it smells good. The scent is different as expected because I haven&#x27;t used geranium oil before. I&#x27;ve used other oils from Aura Cacia before without issues. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> This was for my Mother. She enjoys the smell! It&#x27;s very relaxing and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to results.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Smells like expected.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Got this to make a homemade tick repellent. Product/price is great!  Packaging was like opening a Russian nesting doll- the seller may want to rethink this aspect.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.. Can&#x27;t really tell if it keeps mosquitoes away, which was my reason for purchasing. But at least I don&#x27;t smell strange while testing.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent, but it blended well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review about an oil. I hope it does what for... recipe for wood ticks and a recipe for mosquitoes (sprays). It definitely has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> This I can not live without. It helps with sleep as well as makes my skin beautiful and gives the amazing sense of peace and happiness. I will always purchase!!</li>
            <li> Just love the smell and great for skin. Fair price.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  SWEET SMELLING AND STTRONG.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and works to repel the insects.</li>
            <li> Fragrant, fresh and floral. Nice on skin or in a diffuser. Love this one!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Aura Cacia oils for many years. I am very fond of them. I consider them one of if not the best.</li>
            <li> Added it to almond oil for a wonderful skin oil - smell is great and it feeds my skin -can also add to skin creams.</li>
            <li> great product. will order again!</li>
            <li> This oil arrived quickly and in tact- and the scent is amazing, and of course strong! I will be adding this to my blend of carrot seed oil, rosehip oil and apricot kernel oil for and anti - aging nightly moisturizer for my 54 year old normal to dry complexion. I will update in a number of weeks to report any changes or benefits to my skin with regular nightly use. I am very please with the initial presentation of the product.</li>
            <li> Mixed a few drops of geranium oil into vodka in a spray bottle.  Smells nice and I didn&#x27;t get one bite while camping.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and their cost compared to some other oils.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s geranium oil Lol</li>
            <li> DIsclaimer: I am not a licensed aromatherapist. A flower belonging to the rose family, it has a very strong, floral smell. Prolly a middle note for old lady perfumes, and really belongs in bath soaps. However, I love this oil. I use it to treat stretch marks and scars. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love it!!!  the scent is potent and is a nice addition to the lavender oil for the Vizsla&#x27;s bandanas--natural bug repellent!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m using this in a nightly, anti-aging, facial blend. Geranium is supposed to give your face a lovely &#x27;glow&#x27;. Aura Cacia is one of my favorite brands of Essential Oils (Eden&#x27;s Garden being the other). This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent - very strong though. I need to remember to not use very much at all when diffusing it.</li>
