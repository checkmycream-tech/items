    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was using this product and buying strips to review my progress in reducing my Triglycerides. As my levels decreased each month I was happy with my progression. However, on the morning I was to have the Lab check my official results I decided to check them myself before going to my appointment. Both were within 15 minutes of each other and the CardioChek showed 88 and my actual results from a lab came in at 255. The difference being, you may think your levels are in check and they are actually high risk for heart failure. Difference between life and death.</li>
            <li> Want to track your blood work without hundreds of $$$ in doctor &amp; lab fees?  This is the way to go.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Have spent over fifty $... Have yet to get a valid reading even after calling to ascertain if I was following directions....  What a waste</li>
            <li> Part of my test kit to test cholestrol.  It worked fine.  Hope it helps correct my problem with inbetween testing. I will buy again as needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while.  In my experience, the error varies upto 20%. But still it would be really handy when you are dieting to reduce your trig.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use use easily.   Collecting blood is also easy.   Because the commodity of the price of this level is not sold domestically, it finds it useful very much.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have received test strips that have less than 6 months left before expiration date. And, the cardiochek meter will not allow them to be used after the expiration date (the expiration date is coded in the plastic calibration chip). I ordered total cholesterol strips at the same time and they had a little over a year left before expiration date - that&#x27;s more acceptable.</li>
            <li> I use these cholesterol strips to keep my cholesterol in check.... They shipped them in great condition, I was very pleased. I would recommend these to anyone with high cholesterol problems....</li>
            <li> I did my CardioChek Triglyceride test the same morning that my doctor also tested my triglycerides and the numbers were off by 30.  My doctor&#x27;s test reported the higher number.  If you get this, I would recommend doing the test the same morning that your doctor will also be testing your blood.</li>
            <li> These are great but the expiration date should be further into the future&lt;br /&gt;since you can only take this test about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> These test strips have less than 6 months left before expiration date. CardioCheck meter will not allow them to be used after the expiration date (the expiration date is coded in the plastic calibration chip).</li>
            <li> I have used these test strips for regular home checks.  The results are fairly good (especially when compared to the annual checkups with my doctor).</li>
            <li> It important for me to keep my triglyceride below 100 I double check it at home with CardioChek Triglyceride Test Strips.</li>
            <li> Meter said 105 for my triglycerides. Hospital lab said 100.  Very accurate as soon as you learn to spot it properly.  You need to properly load the sample.  When you do it is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Need an cholesterol analyzer to use this. I did not see this from the Reviews. Just wasted 13 plus dollars.</li>
            <li> Great! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Thank You for a wonderful easy to use product that allows me to track my cholesterol and balance my diet accordingly.  This is a huge help to me as I struggle to balance my eating and internal chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my diabetic lancers to get the blood sample, which was far better than the contraptions that came with the kit.  But the kit is usable if you do not have the diabetic laNCER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well wirth every penny.</li>
            <li> We havent&#x27; used these Triglyceride test strips yet so I don&#x27;t have any personal knowledge.  They look exactly like the total Cholesterol strips that we&#x27;ve used for years so we are expecting similar perfect results.</li>
            <li> I received my test strips in the mail.  The product came super fast and product was as described.  The test is pretty accurate to what the doctors test was.  It was about 8 points lower but still gives you a fairly accurate result.  I would encourage you to get the kit if you need to check your levels.  It is much cheaper than going to the doctors office all the time.  Good way to keep a check on your triglycerides.</li>
