            <li>and I found that the Ostart Pro Steel piercing gun was the best for me.</li>
            <li>This did the trick perfectly!</li>
            <li>the quality is awesome ..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results!!!</li>
            <li>After that, every test fire worked great and when we pierced my daughter&#x27;s ears (she was our guinea pig)</li>
            <li>They look great.  </li>
            <li>i think but great for price</li>
            <li>My kids love that it doesn&#x27;t hurt!!</li>
            <li>were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends ..</li>
            <li>But otherwise it is very easy to put the stud in, it came with a lot of earrings which is a plus!</li>
            <li>It was a good thing.</li>
            <li>it went right through and made a perfectly aimed hole.</li>
            <li>This item is very handy and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is amazing</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I guess you would say, the backs are the rubber kind that don&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>Better</li>
            <li>Tried doing my daughter&#x27;s ears and the stud moved up and pierced the top edge of her ear lobe.</li>
            <li>Love the gun, I&#x27;ve pierced both my ears and a bunchof</li>
            <li>I love how the earrings are stars.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this piercing gun.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item about a month ago and it came in a nice secure case.</li>
            <li>When I went to pierce my nose, everything lined up fine, I was able to get the stud into the gun, and I pulled the trigger.</li>
            <li>What would be better would be a guide on how to put the earring in (for people that dont know) &amp; wipes to clean the ear or wherever you&#x27;re piercing.</li>
            <li>Great product, and the  sets of earrings is the best thing, I have lots of sets that will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>products/ tools available.</li>
            <li>Just an all around cheap product</li>
            <li>The earrings are cheap with rubber backs that won&#x27;t keep the point of the earring from poking you.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li>, and they have all worked out very, very well!</li>
            <li>It didnt affect the product other then that good product..</li>
            <li>It came apart pretty easy, but ear was half pierced until we bought a better unit!</li>
            <li>I received this super fast.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Since I was unsure after reading the reviews how well this might work, I wanted to experiment first.</li>
            <li>Thinking the first stud may have a manufacturing defect I tried several more, most fit too tight to release.</li>
            <li>I did have to cut off part of the metal on the gun, as there wasn&#x27;t enough room to get my ear skin in it to do the piercing, but that was pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I am kind of superstitious a little too</li>
            <li>The earring doesn&#x27;t stay straight.</li>
            <li>i just need a automated one much faster</li>
            <li>Just remember, you MUST sterilize the gun, the earring, and the earring stopper, completely, as well as your ear where you are going to pierce it!!!</li>
            <li>, they seemed to be a loose fit.</li>
            <li>Even though this was only $11, it&#x27;s still not even worth it.</li>
            <li>NORMALLY BECAUSE THEY TEAR SKIN BTU</li>
            <li>I have been debating piercing my ears a few more times for a while now.</li>
            <li>The earrings wear shaped funny and hurt my ears the second they were in.</li>
            <li>Came on time its small like the picture but good for adding extra piercing only on ears though</li>
            <li>figured the gun would be cheaper and hassle free, but it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Got jammed right when I pulled it back.</li>
            <li>Apparently the gun didn&#x27;t pierce it the whole way through my nose, and I can&#x27;t try it again because the stud is still jammed in the gun.</li>
            <li>This little gun works really well.  </li>
            <li>This causes a huge amount of pain that is unnecessary.</li>

            <li> This little gun works really well.  </li>
            <li> This causes a huge amount of pain that is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small to be of much use.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times for it to work but each time it never went all the way through only half way</li>
            <li> Not safe due to too much toggle of the earring stud in chamber.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the only other pain was that I had to use a piece of tissue to hold the jewelry straight because it kept wanting to droop down &amp; getting uneven</li>
            <li> but I was not happy that the mirror fell out the first time it was opened &amp; therefore broke all over my floor.</li>
            <li> My first test fire (using a small piece of cardboard) did not release the stud from the gun, it took some serious wiggling to get the stud loose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of other things.</li>
            <li> The marking pen was dried out; so pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I found this little device to be a jewel among the &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> and we took a small drill bit and very carefully drilled out the barrel.</li>
            <li> I was scared to order this at first because of the bad reviews I read, but ended up ordering it anyways.</li>
            <li> We put all the studs in a small zip-loc bag instead of leaving them on the cardboard holder.</li>
            <li> so I used a small square of tissue &amp; some needle nose pliers to line it up &amp; then used the gun.</li>
            <li> This entire set was in very poor condition.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but its hard to tell considering that there are absolutely no instructions at all on how to use</li>
            <li> so I am not thrilled about breaking any mirrors.</li>
            <li> The gun was either missing a part or broken, which it didn&#x27;t appear to be, but there was no where to place the stud.</li>
            <li> THIS FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT PIERCED HALF WAY THROUGH MY EAR AND GOT STUCK</li>
            <li> Obviously not a good thing if the stud is already in your ear.</li>
            <li> The gun was broken when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> The box was broken, the earring backs were melted, the pen didn&#x27;t work, and the gun jams.</li>
            <li> FUCK</li>
            <li> I have five kids, and they all want their ear pierced, taking them into get them done was getting expensive.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get the stud out of the gun because it was stuck.</li>
            <li> Also, very difficult to maintain sterile conditions.  </li>
            <li> and you either have to re pierce the ear or just shove an earring in :(</li>
            <li> Horrible worst purchase ever.</li>
            <li> . . . They&#x27;re horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible thing to sell to people</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> And we paid someone else poking our ear loaf or squeeze our nose or nipples. I could do it myself with no worry. Nice</li>
            <li> Even though this was only $11, it&#x27;s still not even worth it. The gun was broken when I opened the package. The prongs were all bent each way and when I loaded a stud into the slot just to see if it worked, the stud is now STUCK in the slot and I can&#x27;t get it out making the gun unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this super fast. I have five kids, and they all want their ear pierced, taking them into get them done was getting expensive. My last straw was when my youngest got a infection and since then I decided to do it myself. I did my research and I found that the Ostart Pro Steel piercing gun was the best for me. My kids love that it doesn&#x27;t hurt!! Great product, and the  sets of earrings is the best thing, I have lots of sets that will last a very long time! Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Do not recommend.  Not safe due to too much toggle of the earring stud in chamber.  Also, very difficult to maintain sterile conditions.  Better products/ tools available.</li>
            <li> Before I even used the gun the mirror was already broke off the case. When I went to pierce my nose, everything lined up fine, I was able to get the stud into the gun, and I pulled the trigger. I was unable to get the stud out of the gun because it was stuck. I managed to get it off of my nose, but the stud is still stuck in the gun. I tried to put another stud in the hole I pierced, but couldn&#x27;t get it through. Apparently the gun didn&#x27;t pierce it the whole way through my nose, and I can&#x27;t try it again because the stud is still jammed in the gun. Maybe I did something wrong, but its hard to tell considering that there are absolutely no instructions at all on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured the gun would be cheaper and hassle free, but it was a complete waste of money. It would have been much easier to have spent a few extra dollars to get it professionally done.</li>
            <li> This is not what I got</li>
            <li> Horrible worst purchase ever. Got jammed right when I pulled it back. Earrings suck. Just an all around cheap product</li>
            <li> This entire set was in very poor condition. The box was broken, the earring backs were melted, the pen didn&#x27;t work, and the gun jams.</li>
            <li> Trash. The earing move around inside the gun. Tried doing my daughter&#x27;s ears and the stud moved up and pierced the top edge of her ear lobe. This product is just garbage.</li>
            <li> I had a jeweler friend of mine try to use this on my daughter. It pierced halfway and got stuck. It came apart pretty easy, but ear was half pierced until we bought a better unit!</li>
            <li> FUCK THIS GUN I DONT LIEK GUNS NORMALLY BECAUSE THEY TEAR SKIN BTU I DECIDED TO TRY IT THIS FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT PIERCED HALF WAY THROUGH MY EAR AND GOT STUCK NEVER AGAIN PLEASE, DO NTO BUY THIS ITEM I BELIEVE THE EAARING CONTAIN LED AS WELL DO NOT USE.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times for it to work but each time it never went all the way through only half way</li>
            <li> Love the gun, I&#x27;ve pierced both my ears and a bunchof my friends&#x27; as well, nothing gotten infected from it etc, but sometimes the earring gets stuck in the gun and you either have to re pierce the ear or just shove an earring in :(</li>
            <li> I will probably throw it away or sell it in a garage sale. The earring doesn&#x27;t stay straight. It wobbles. This causes a huge amount of pain that is unnecessary. The earrings are cheap with rubber backs that won&#x27;t keep the point of the earring from poking you. Do not buy this!</li>
            <li> I bought this for one purpose: Piercing my (or others) ears and it does just that. Since I was unsure after reading the reviews how well this might work, I wanted to experiment first. It was a good thing. My first test fire (using a small piece of cardboard) did not release the stud from the gun, it took some serious wiggling to get the stud loose. Obviously not a good thing if the stud is already in your ear. Thinking the first stud may have a manufacturing defect I tried several more, most fit too tight to release. Looking closer it appeared the chrome plating on the outside of the barrel had gotten inside. I asked my husband if he had any suggestions and we took a small drill bit and very carefully drilled out the barrel. This did the trick perfectly! After that, every test fire worked great and when we pierced my daughter&#x27;s ears (she was our guinea pig) we had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other things. The marking pen was dried out; so pretty much useless. The mirror is too small to be of much use. We put all the studs in a small zip-loc bag instead of leaving them on the cardboard holder.</li>
            <li> This little gun works really well.  I did have to cut off part of the metal on the gun, as there wasn&#x27;t enough room to get my ear skin in it to do the piercing, but that was pretty easy.  I love how the earrings are stars.  They look great.  Just remember, you MUST sterilize the gun, the earring, and the earring stopper, completely, as well as your ear where you are going to pierce it!!! I use Dettol (diluted, of course), but I think alcohol would work well, too  I&#x27;ve done about 4 piercings on my ears (non-cartilage -- Never USE A GUN FOR CARTILAGE PIERCINGS!!! AH!), and they have all worked out very, very well!</li>
            <li> The earrings are horrible but the gun is great! The earrings are plastic I guess you would say, the backs are the rubber kind that don&#x27;t stay on.  . . . They&#x27;re horrible</li>
            <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
            <li> Flimsy but did the job</li>
            <li> Came on time its small like the picture but good for adding extra piercing only on ears though</li>
            <li> I have been debating piercing my ears a few more times for a while now. But because I am in college, I wanted to find the cheapest way to do it. I was scared to order this at first because of the bad reviews I read, but ended up ordering it anyways. I had a friend do the piercings for me. There were no problems at all. The piercing earrings that came with it went right through and made a perfectly aimed hole. The only problem I had was that the rubber backings on the piercing earrings kept falling off. Other than that, I am extremely happy. I pierced three holes in each lobe and one in my cartilage. I absolutely love the results!!!</li>
            <li> Used it Christmas day for my daughter but I was not happy that the mirror fell out the first time it was opened &amp; therefore broke all over my floor. I am kind of superstitious a little too so I am not thrilled about breaking any mirrors. Other than that the only other pain was that I had to use a piece of tissue to hold the jewelry straight because it kept wanting to droop down &amp; getting uneven so I used a small square of tissue &amp; some needle nose pliers to line it up &amp; then used the gun.</li>
            <li> The earrings wear shaped funny and hurt my ears the second they were in. Horrible thing to sell to people</li>
            <li> I love it I had pierc my mom my dad and my sis and outher people I love this get it it is amazing</li>
            <li> Just didnt like the studs they came with, they seemed to be a loose fit. It didnt affect the product other then that good product..</li>
            <li> I found this little device to be a jewel among the &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; influences. This item is very handy and extremely easy to use. Just use caution as you would with anything that makes an entrance into your skin or body. I love this piercing gun. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A lil sticky when,using but it works i just need a automated one much faster i think but great for price</li>
            <li> The pack of studs and the marker were the only things that &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; in the package. The gun was either missing a part or broken, which it didn&#x27;t appear to be, but there was no where to place the stud. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item about a month ago and it came in a nice secure case. One thing i dont like is that the mirror was not connected when it came in the box. But otherwise it is very easy to put the stud in, it came with a lot of earrings which is a plus! What would be better would be a guide on how to put the earring in (for people that dont know) &amp; wipes to clean the ear or wherever you&#x27;re piercing.</li>
