            <li>Great experience.</li>
            <li>ladies,buy this one, you will love!!</li>
            <li>I usually love this pencil, wonderful pick me up, but I would not purchase this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a cakey texture either, making it even more wonderful.</li>
            <li>Pleasant consistency and scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to  use, great tool!</li>
            <li>Enter the Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright Pencil.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this Eye Bright stick all the time and will be carrying it around in my purse to reapply it during the day on my lower waterlines when needed.</li>
            <li>I got the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil in a Benefit kit at a Paris Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that if you don&#x27;t wipe away any mis-landed eyeshadow/eyeliner, it gets on the Eye Bright and makes it smeary.</li>
            <li>I also tried another brand at Sephora and that one didn&#x27;t look good as well.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shimmery and catches the light perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it would make for a good brow highlight.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li>I love this eye bright pencil!</li>
            <li>I love the Eye Bright Pencil!</li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s Eye Bright Pencil is truly amazing how it brightens my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look nice &amp; bright.</li>
            <li>I love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>And I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>This cannot possibly be authentic Eye Bright.</li>
            <li>This pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also have Benefit&#x27;s Ooh La Lift, and IMO, Eye Bright works a helluva lot better and stays all day.</li>
            <li>But it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li>This time around, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>NICE PRICE</li>
            <li>But it is handy in a purse for touch ups</li>
            <li>Love this authentic eye bright pencil and received it really quickly from best sales ever dealer:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Great color, but the application procedure makes this barely worth a 3.</li>
            <li>You Rebel Light, Boing Concealer, Get Even powder, and Eye Bright.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the size is nice.</li>
            <li>Originally I had the eye bright in the travel boing set</li>
            <li>One artist was awesome but the other one didn&#x27;t know about all the uses of Eye Bright and tried to sell me a cheek highlighter which is NOT what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I like the IDEA of this makeup pencil and generally this brand is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This Benefit pencil goes on very smoothly but don&#x27;t put it on after your mascara or you end up with sci-fi lashes that look like they are floating away from your lower lid.  </li>
            <li>I love the way I look well-rested when I use this concealer.  </li>
            <li>Better off purchasing the brighter in a pot (also by Benefit).  </li>
            <li>It stays better longer and is better for the skin.</li>
            <li>it helped me gain confidence :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have used in corner of eyes and underneath to get a more youthful dewy appearance.</li>
            <li>I think if I was able to USE it</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BENEFIT</li>
            <li>but glad I got to try something</li>
            <li>I love kits.  </li>
            <li>Love these pencils, I have purchased before and will continue to do so</li>
            <li>This pencil is OK.</li>
            <li>and you couldn&#x27;t see them any more.</li>
            <li>I love the brightness it gives to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>LOVE this pencil.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite must.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye pencil from Benefit nothing quite like it however if your on a budget, it is too pricey.</li>
            <li>Will buy more once out....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i am in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it helps with shaping my eyebrows and highlighting them.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite eye highlighter.</li>
            <li>I would def recommend that color over this one for people with more tan or olive tones.</li>
            <li>need to order more while they are still in stock.</li>
            <li>So, I am in love with this pencil.</li>
            <li>That way you dont risk messing up your makeup with more concealer (getting too</li>
            <li>Love this product and will forever be keeping it in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>You will love this.</li>
            <li>great product if its real.</li>
            <li>It is quite possibly my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good and I received it right on time.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good tested it as soon as I recieved  </li>
            <li>Pretty good for around the eyes.</li>
            <li>love the pencil easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent and easy to use and lasts all day long without smudging!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, handy to have for those quick refresh under eyes.</li>
            <li>She applied the Benefit shadow liner (comes in a kit) with a slant tip makeup brush under my lower waterlines to show me that liner would really stand out with the Eye Bright pencil.</li>
            <li>It sweats off, clogs pores, creases under eyes and doesn&#x27;t fit into any cosmetic pencil sharpener I&#x27;ve ever encountered--and I have encountered many.</li>
            <li>and it was not so soft, it could be a great product.</li>
            <li>Great quality, easy-breezy, professional brand.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, bright and light.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, great customer service, why are you still reading?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and blends very nicely.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product - however, it tends to go on more cakey than creamy.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at all the reviews there were for this item (which brought me to purchasing this item), however, I believe it&#x27;s not as easy to use as people make it to be...     </li>
            <li>I used it, then moved on to something that served my special needs more.</li>
            <li>,  the product itself, meh...it looked nice when I first put it on</li>
            <li>I gotta say, this is hands down the best eye brightning pencil I have found over the years.</li>
            <li>The pencil glides on easy leaving, blends amazingly and gives a brightening effect that leaves you looking well rested and ready for whatever the day has to offer.</li>
            <li>So far haven&#x27;t noticed anything to amazing, but I think I need to use more of the product to get the desired effect.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are extremely sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no troubles using the eye bright pencil either.  </li>
            <li>Works great for lighting up your eye and makes you look younger!</li>
            <li>reviewers mentioned that they use this under their eyes, too; I&#x27;ve never tried that before since it seems like the pencil would be too drying to smooth into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 52, light complexion, oily combo skin)</li>
            <li>So use a light hand.      </li>
            <li>This pencil is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Also the lid didn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on which my be the reason for the dryness.</li>
            <li>I have light tan olive skin with darker brown hair.</li>
            <li>I can use it, but I must apply with a really light hand</li>
            <li>Its great for the inner corners of the eye as well as under eye circles.  </li>
            <li>Great product I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>In a pinch it can be a light</li>
            <li>way too light</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t seen other reviews mention this, but I also put the Eye Bright under the outer eyebrow to lighten and brighen there!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>One benefits long time great products.</li>
            <li>This is a great &amp;#34;concealer/brightener&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with a slight olive tone.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a huge difference in looking more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Very nice shade of light pink.</li>
            <li>It REALLY makes the eye area look more awake,covers darkened skin and gives the illusion of a \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  </li>
            <li>This is a true wake-me-up product.  </li>
            <li>and I dont think it looks good with my eyes, its too white</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Glad I did as it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Other buyers may have great use for this product.</li>
            <li>I have been having fun this morning putting the Eye Bright pencil everywhere on my face: on the browbone as a highlighter, in the inner corners of my eyes, outer corners, on the lower waterline, then below the shadow liner as a concealer.</li>
            <li>It might different if I use liquid foundation which is more moist instead of mineral powder (I use the pencil on top of foundation).  </li>
            <li>It was good while I had it, but I&#x27;ve found another product in a crème that my fair, dry skin prefers both under and above my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also find it sharpens best with my Urban Decay Grindhouse Double Barrel Sharpener.</li>
            <li>I love high lighters for the area around my eyes and just below my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It glides right on the skin in the corners of the eyes, then a quick little smudge with a q tip or finger, and Im good to go for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>I also use this on my cupids bow and long the lower lip line to enhance lip fullness-just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>A welcome change to black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks good for the first hour, but my experience is that it starts creasing and has an obvious look.  </li>
            <li>It really does awaken the eyes!!</li>
            <li>I have somewhat red eyes most of the time, and this product, when used on the rim of my eyelid, from the inside corner to the pupil, top and bottom, and then my dark liner on the outer corner to the pupil, it gives that wide-awake bright eye look, even when I&#x27;m lacking sleep.  </li>
            <li>so it goes fast, and it does not come with a pencil sharpener, which would be fine</li>
            <li>I am 34 and really, really wish I had discovered Eye Bright when I was younger.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and this cheap knockoff is a joke compared to their real makeup.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a cheap white eyeliner at a drugstore as one reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>There are soft highlighting powders that work better to brighten under the eyes</li>
            <li>All you have it that pencil mark&#x27;s worth on your face.</li>
            <li>If used correctly this item gets the job done, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was exactly worth the price of the product....</li>
            <li>I found this pencil to be fairly pale/cool pink for my tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was quite worth the $20 you have to pay in store</li>
            <li>I rarely have to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many high lighters from many different brands before.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Eye pencil is not the right format to deliver this product.  </li>
            <li>It brightens my eyes right up.  </li>
            <li>the reviews are usually right on.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a pencil, you can dab it right on &amp; when you put your foundation on, it really camoflauges!</li>
            <li>I can get ready quickly by skipping eye shadow all together and just using this with some eyeliner and mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am going to purchase the Gilded and give this light pink one to my daughter. :)</li>
            <li>Recieved product super fast as well.</li>
            <li>The product itself is just as good, but I did find the black siding chipped quite a bit when I would put the cap on.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sold at first when I went to the Benefit counter and applied it to my lower waterlines.</li>
            <li>use it mostly in the inner corners/tear ducts of my eyes.</li>
            <li>More recently I was cleaning things out and decided to give it another shot.</li>
            <li>I use a bit on the inner corners of my eyes to look more awake.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Sephora!</li>
            <li>My eyes look bigger and I do look more awake.  </li>
            <li>Simply put i love it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the hot climate or my watery eyes, but just thought I&#x27;d post.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, blends well, and it work WONDERS!</li>
            <li>I recently received my eye pencil, and am simply in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how big of a difference it would make, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>Really brightens up the eyes!</li>
            <li>Love this product and can be used in various ways and areas of the face!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s matte not shimmer, as I use it as a highlight above the eyebrow for a brighter, lifted look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a very flattering color, so much better then those white pencils that are out there......</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for highlighting around eyes or as pale pink lipstick that stays put all day or night.</li>
            <li>I was tired of trying to use some kind of shimmery eyeshadow to highlight my eyes like some kind of 14 year old.</li>
            <li>but if I use a knife the pencil is soft enough you can sharpen it very easily.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right that this is a fabulous concealer too!</li>
            <li>So far, great product at much more reasonable price than Sephora or expensive department store.  </li>
            <li>You do need a LARGE pencil sharpener for this product.</li>
            <li>This pencil is going to outlast me because it is rather large compared to the amount used each day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, but suggest you go to a Benefit makeup counter or Sephora and have it applied on you first to try it.</li>
            <li>The reason why this Eye Bright pencil works so well is the specific pink shade of color.</li>
            <li>It really does reflect the light upwards, making eye circles invisible, especially in flash photos!</li>
            <li>I had to spend nearly as much on the sharpener as this stick cost.</li>
            <li>Also, does not do much brightening.  </li>
            <li>It really stood out (I applied a lot by accident).</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need that as much since I have highlighters.</li>
            <li>came fast</li>
            <li>It brightens that whole area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important that your skin be moisturized, otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to blend properly.</li>
            <li>As a Photographer I use it much of the time for my shoots and it really makes the eyes in every picture stand out.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have for anyone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much sleep.</li>
            <li>I suppose that is the whole point of using makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tan which I thought was going to be a problem</li>
            <li>It really wakes up my eyes</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It works very well as an accent under the outer brow line too.</li>
            <li>I dab some of this on either side of my eyes in the morning and it really draws attention away from the tiredness in my face.</li>
            <li>It really perks up my eyes and does away with any redness.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain about it.</li>
            <li>It IS light, but even though you&#x27;re not supposed to go any lighter under the eye than the rest of your face, I actually prefer to.</li>
            <li>Found the sponge would take too much off.  </li>
            <li>Not a deal breaker since the product is the real thing</li>
            <li>go into any Sephora and swatch the real one yourself.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>i cannot figure out what the difference is between this and so many other cream shadows, liners, highlighters, etc.  </li>
            <li>This is very subtle but the effect is great.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product brightens up eyes better than any other product i have ever used...</li>
            <li>My other favorite high lighter is by Stila.</li>
            <li>The makeup was supposed to be new!</li>
            <li>This stick was a good highlighter, but I could never have used a hard stick on my sensitive skin under my eyes to conceal shadows.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the makeup artist showed me how to apply it to the inner and outer corners of my eyes like arrows.</li>
            <li>I just used it under my eyes (on top of foundation) for extra brightness and on my red acne scar spots!</li>
            <li>Gives my whole face the extra pop I need to look fresh &amp; awake.</li>
            <li>Eye Bright is definitely a must have product for me now, and I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase when this pencil is done, which won&#x27;t be for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I typically do a low key make-up look, and this product on the inner corners of my eyes and on the brow bone looks completely natural and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It reflects the light and covers about 80% of my dark circles, which is better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get a little sharpener.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good fix for tired eyes</li>
            <li>I finally found the right product.  </li>
            <li>This pencil is very soft and creamy and not hard at all like it said in a couple of the reviews.</li>
            <li>The Eye bright pencil color I received was completely different from the one I usually buy directly from Benefit Counter.  </li>
            <li>this is what I get for thinking I could get it new one</li>
            <li>A dab of this each day, and you&#x27;ll look like a bright-eyed beauty, regardless of how little sleep you got the night before!  :-)</li>
            <li>I love this little pencil!</li>
            <li>Better off using $0.99 Wet N Wild white eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The top black cap has been super glued on unevenly and does not sit flush on the pencil.</li>
            <li>It blends easily and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look dried out.  </li>
            <li>Most products cover about 20% of the dark circles, so 80% is a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li>Also, ended up buying the expensive $36 big beautiful eyes kit that contains the shadow liner so I could recreate the look myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have fairly large asian eyes that i wanted to accentuate without getting that \\&quot;anime doll\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li>This little item is just waht I need to make me feel confident in public.</li>
            <li>Cons are the product is really soft</li>
            <li>Again, it has to be blended well to get a natural effect instead of</li>
            <li>I have a teething seven month old, so I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my lips and around my eyes to open up the whole area.</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s soft to the skin</li>
            <li>Works well for people sensitive to allergies.</li>
            <li>That being said, it truly does brighten the whole eye in 1/2 a second!</li>
            <li>It evens out the whole area, having it in the inner eye and browline.</li>
            <li>The brightening looks natural and doesn&#x27;t crease or cake up like concealers can sometimes do.</li>
            <li>but somehow this pencil is so smooth but firm</li>
            <li>so it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>It never goes &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in color no matter how old mine has become.  </li>
            <li>The last one I got kept breaking when I would apply it, but it&#x27;s a soft enough pencil that I can kind of squish it back together and still use it carefully.</li>
            <li>I have slight dark circles, and I wear glasses; so my eye area is pretty shady, lol.</li>
            <li>This little Eye Bright pen is like my new secret weapon, haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Eye Bright stick for a few years now, and, because you only need a little bit of this, it really does last forever.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth the price since one pencil will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>Lasts long really enhances and highlights the eyebrow arc area opening up the eye.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is so hard to find a good concealer for my extremely dark circles!  </li>
            <li>After some of the high reviews I had high hopes for this, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me as I expected.</li>
            <li>This pencil is very soft, therefore you end up using and sharpening the pencil so much it does not last long.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to wear make-up, but I have large pockets of fluid under my eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li>It definitely brightens in a natural looking way!</li>
            <li>I use it for my eyes, but also to &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; any other lines, such as laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>i have always struggled with dark under eye circles, and this product just brightened the look of my whole face!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t quite like the look at the store because I really noticed the pink pencil on my waterline</li>
            <li>With the hefty price tag and all of the raving reviews, I expected this pencil to perform very well.</li>
            <li>Really brightens your eyes and makes them the center of attention.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I opened this pencil to find the lead of the pencil was floating in the middle of the outter wood part.</li>
            <li>Will buy it directly from Benefit only!</li>
            <li>Also, check your makeup in natural like, I found this looked like it blended well in my bathroom mirror but had to do some additional blending once I saw myself outside.</li>
            <li>I tried Sephora&#x27;s pink eyeliner first (only $5 or $6) as another reviewer suggested and</li>
            <li>It really makes the eyes pop and will last for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m editing this from 4 to 3 stars after using a little longer, because now I had to seek and purchase a special sharpener for it, as it is bigger than standard eye &amp; lip liners.  </li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t crumble but not dry at all!)</li>
            <li>Like the way they conceal redness under my eyes, and the pink helps to hi light places that need a little &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Its fantastic when I&#x27;ve been traveling or just super tired!!</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to take too much time to gently blend so that I don&#x27;t stretch the delicate eye skin.  </li>
            <li>, however it is really large and not the average eye pencil.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dark circles under my eyes regardless of how much sleep</li>
            <li>and I have had genetic dark circles under my eyes my whole life.</li>
            <li>First of all I received the product with in a few days of ordering, it was faster than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>This is part of my \\&quot;new mom routine\\&quot; for being quick applying &amp; not looking tired:</li>
            <li>The content is pretty malleable, the pencil casing scratches the sensitive eye area if you press hard enough for the product to transfer.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the inner corners of my eyes, just under my eyebrows, and I actually color in the whole dark circle under my eye, then blend the edges with my fingertip.  </li>
            <li>Really works to conceal dark circles on eyes!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great experience.</li>
            <li> ladies,buy this one, you will love!!</li>
            <li> I usually love this pencil, wonderful pick me up, but I would not purchase this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a cakey texture either, making it even more wonderful.</li>
            <li> Pleasant consistency and scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to  use, great tool!</li>
            <li> Enter the Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright Pencil.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this Eye Bright stick all the time and will be carrying it around in my purse to reapply it during the day on my lower waterlines when needed.</li>
            <li> I got the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil in a Benefit kit at a Paris Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if you don&#x27;t wipe away any mis-landed eyeshadow/eyeliner, it gets on the Eye Bright and makes it smeary.</li>
            <li> I also tried another brand at Sephora and that one didn&#x27;t look good as well.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shimmery and catches the light perfectly.</li>
            <li> but it would make for a good brow highlight.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li> I love this eye bright pencil!</li>
            <li> I love the Eye Bright Pencil!</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s Eye Bright Pencil is truly amazing how it brightens my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Makes my eyes look nice &amp; bright.</li>
            <li> I love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> And I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> This cannot possibly be authentic Eye Bright.</li>
            <li> This pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I also have Benefit&#x27;s Ooh La Lift, and IMO, Eye Bright works a helluva lot better and stays all day.</li>
            <li> But it does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> This time around, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> NICE PRICE</li>
            <li> But it is handy in a purse for touch ups</li>
            <li> Love this authentic eye bright pencil and received it really quickly from best sales ever dealer:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Great color, but the application procedure makes this barely worth a 3.</li>
            <li> You Rebel Light, Boing Concealer, Get Even powder, and Eye Bright.  </li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the size is nice.</li>
            <li> Originally I had the eye bright in the travel boing set</li>
            <li> One artist was awesome but the other one didn&#x27;t know about all the uses of Eye Bright and tried to sell me a cheek highlighter which is NOT what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the IDEA of this makeup pencil and generally this brand is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This Benefit pencil goes on very smoothly but don&#x27;t put it on after your mascara or you end up with sci-fi lashes that look like they are floating away from your lower lid.  </li>
            <li> I love the way I look well-rested when I use this concealer.  </li>
            <li> Better off purchasing the brighter in a pot (also by Benefit).  </li>
            <li> It stays better longer and is better for the skin.</li>
            <li> it helped me gain confidence :)</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have used in corner of eyes and underneath to get a more youthful dewy appearance.</li>
            <li> I think if I was able to USE it</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BENEFIT</li>
            <li> but glad I got to try something</li>
            <li> I love kits.  </li>
            <li> Love these pencils, I have purchased before and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> This pencil is OK.</li>
            <li> and you couldn&#x27;t see them any more.</li>
            <li> I love the brightness it gives to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> LOVE this pencil.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite must.  </li>
            <li> Love this eye pencil from Benefit nothing quite like it however if your on a budget, it is too pricey.</li>
            <li> Will buy more once out....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i am in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it helps with shaping my eyebrows and highlighting them.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite eye highlighter.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend that color over this one for people with more tan or olive tones.</li>
            <li> need to order more while they are still in stock.</li>
            <li> So, I am in love with this pencil.</li>
            <li> That way you dont risk messing up your makeup with more concealer (getting too</li>
            <li> Love this product and will forever be keeping it in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> You will love this.</li>
            <li> great product if its real.</li>
            <li> It is quite possibly my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good and I received it right on time.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good tested it as soon as I recieved  </li>
            <li> Pretty good for around the eyes.</li>
            <li> love the pencil easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use and lasts all day long without smudging!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, handy to have for those quick refresh under eyes.</li>
            <li> She applied the Benefit shadow liner (comes in a kit) with a slant tip makeup brush under my lower waterlines to show me that liner would really stand out with the Eye Bright pencil.</li>
            <li> It sweats off, clogs pores, creases under eyes and doesn&#x27;t fit into any cosmetic pencil sharpener I&#x27;ve ever encountered--and I have encountered many.</li>
            <li> and it was not so soft, it could be a great product.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy-breezy, professional brand.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, bright and light.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great customer service, why are you still reading?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and blends very nicely.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product - however, it tends to go on more cakey than creamy.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at all the reviews there were for this item (which brought me to purchasing this item), however, I believe it&#x27;s not as easy to use as people make it to be...     </li>
            <li> I used it, then moved on to something that served my special needs more.</li>
            <li> ,  the product itself, meh...it looked nice when I first put it on</li>
            <li> I gotta say, this is hands down the best eye brightning pencil I have found over the years.</li>
            <li> The pencil glides on easy leaving, blends amazingly and gives a brightening effect that leaves you looking well rested and ready for whatever the day has to offer.</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t noticed anything to amazing, but I think I need to use more of the product to get the desired effect.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are extremely sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no troubles using the eye bright pencil either.  </li>
            <li> Works great for lighting up your eye and makes you look younger!</li>
            <li> reviewers mentioned that they use this under their eyes, too; I&#x27;ve never tried that before since it seems like the pencil would be too drying to smooth into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 52, light complexion, oily combo skin)</li>
            <li> So use a light hand.      </li>
            <li> This pencil is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Also the lid didn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on which my be the reason for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I have light tan olive skin with darker brown hair.</li>
            <li> I can use it, but I must apply with a really light hand</li>
            <li> Its great for the inner corners of the eye as well as under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Great product I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> In a pinch it can be a light</li>
            <li> way too light</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t seen other reviews mention this, but I also put the Eye Bright under the outer eyebrow to lighten and brighen there!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> One benefits long time great products.</li>
            <li> This is a great &amp;#34;concealer/brightener&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with a slight olive tone.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a huge difference in looking more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very nice shade of light pink.</li>
            <li> It REALLY makes the eye area look more awake,covers darkened skin and gives the illusion of a \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  </li>
            <li> This is a true wake-me-up product.  </li>
            <li> and I dont think it looks good with my eyes, its too white</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Glad I did as it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Other buyers may have great use for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been having fun this morning putting the Eye Bright pencil everywhere on my face: on the browbone as a highlighter, in the inner corners of my eyes, outer corners, on the lower waterline, then below the shadow liner as a concealer.</li>
            <li> It might different if I use liquid foundation which is more moist instead of mineral powder (I use the pencil on top of foundation).  </li>
            <li> It was good while I had it, but I&#x27;ve found another product in a crème that my fair, dry skin prefers both under and above my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also find it sharpens best with my Urban Decay Grindhouse Double Barrel Sharpener.</li>
            <li> I love high lighters for the area around my eyes and just below my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It glides right on the skin in the corners of the eyes, then a quick little smudge with a q tip or finger, and Im good to go for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> I also use this on my cupids bow and long the lower lip line to enhance lip fullness-just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> A welcome change to black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks good for the first hour, but my experience is that it starts creasing and has an obvious look.  </li>
            <li> It really does awaken the eyes!!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat red eyes most of the time, and this product, when used on the rim of my eyelid, from the inside corner to the pupil, top and bottom, and then my dark liner on the outer corner to the pupil, it gives that wide-awake bright eye look, even when I&#x27;m lacking sleep.  </li>
            <li> so it goes fast, and it does not come with a pencil sharpener, which would be fine</li>
            <li> I am 34 and really, really wish I had discovered Eye Bright when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and this cheap knockoff is a joke compared to their real makeup.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a cheap white eyeliner at a drugstore as one reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> There are soft highlighting powders that work better to brighten under the eyes</li>
            <li> All you have it that pencil mark&#x27;s worth on your face.</li>
            <li> If used correctly this item gets the job done, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was exactly worth the price of the product....</li>
            <li> I found this pencil to be fairly pale/cool pink for my tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was quite worth the $20 you have to pay in store</li>
            <li> I rarely have to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many high lighters from many different brands before.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Eye pencil is not the right format to deliver this product.  </li>
            <li> It brightens my eyes right up.  </li>
            <li> the reviews are usually right on.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a pencil, you can dab it right on &amp; when you put your foundation on, it really camoflauges!</li>
            <li> I can get ready quickly by skipping eye shadow all together and just using this with some eyeliner and mascara.  </li>
            <li> I am going to purchase the Gilded and give this light pink one to my daughter. :)</li>
            <li> Recieved product super fast as well.</li>
            <li> The product itself is just as good, but I did find the black siding chipped quite a bit when I would put the cap on.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sold at first when I went to the Benefit counter and applied it to my lower waterlines.</li>
            <li> use it mostly in the inner corners/tear ducts of my eyes.</li>
            <li> More recently I was cleaning things out and decided to give it another shot.</li>
            <li> I use a bit on the inner corners of my eyes to look more awake.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Sephora!</li>
            <li> My eyes look bigger and I do look more awake.  </li>
            <li> Simply put i love it</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the hot climate or my watery eyes, but just thought I&#x27;d post.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy, blends well, and it work WONDERS!</li>
            <li> I recently received my eye pencil, and am simply in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how big of a difference it would make, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Really brightens up the eyes!</li>
            <li> Love this product and can be used in various ways and areas of the face!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s matte not shimmer, as I use it as a highlight above the eyebrow for a brighter, lifted look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very flattering color, so much better then those white pencils that are out there......</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for highlighting around eyes or as pale pink lipstick that stays put all day or night.</li>
            <li> I was tired of trying to use some kind of shimmery eyeshadow to highlight my eyes like some kind of 14 year old.</li>
            <li> but if I use a knife the pencil is soft enough you can sharpen it very easily.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right that this is a fabulous concealer too!</li>
            <li> So far, great product at much more reasonable price than Sephora or expensive department store.  </li>
            <li> You do need a LARGE pencil sharpener for this product.</li>
            <li> This pencil is going to outlast me because it is rather large compared to the amount used each day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, but suggest you go to a Benefit makeup counter or Sephora and have it applied on you first to try it.</li>
            <li> The reason why this Eye Bright pencil works so well is the specific pink shade of color.</li>
            <li> It really does reflect the light upwards, making eye circles invisible, especially in flash photos!</li>
            <li> I had to spend nearly as much on the sharpener as this stick cost.</li>
            <li> Also, does not do much brightening.  </li>
            <li> It really stood out (I applied a lot by accident).</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need that as much since I have highlighters.</li>
            <li> came fast</li>
            <li> It brightens that whole area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important that your skin be moisturized, otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to blend properly.</li>
            <li> As a Photographer I use it much of the time for my shoots and it really makes the eyes in every picture stand out.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much sleep.</li>
            <li> I suppose that is the whole point of using makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tan which I thought was going to be a problem</li>
            <li> It really wakes up my eyes</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It works very well as an accent under the outer brow line too.</li>
            <li> I dab some of this on either side of my eyes in the morning and it really draws attention away from the tiredness in my face.</li>
            <li> It really perks up my eyes and does away with any redness.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain about it.</li>
            <li> It IS light, but even though you&#x27;re not supposed to go any lighter under the eye than the rest of your face, I actually prefer to.</li>
            <li> Found the sponge would take too much off.  </li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker since the product is the real thing</li>
            <li> go into any Sephora and swatch the real one yourself.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> i cannot figure out what the difference is between this and so many other cream shadows, liners, highlighters, etc.  </li>
            <li> This is very subtle but the effect is great.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product brightens up eyes better than any other product i have ever used...</li>
            <li> My other favorite high lighter is by Stila.</li>
            <li> The makeup was supposed to be new!</li>
            <li> This stick was a good highlighter, but I could never have used a hard stick on my sensitive skin under my eyes to conceal shadows.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the makeup artist showed me how to apply it to the inner and outer corners of my eyes like arrows.</li>
            <li> I just used it under my eyes (on top of foundation) for extra brightness and on my red acne scar spots!</li>
            <li> Gives my whole face the extra pop I need to look fresh &amp; awake.</li>
            <li> Eye Bright is definitely a must have product for me now, and I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase when this pencil is done, which won&#x27;t be for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I typically do a low key make-up look, and this product on the inner corners of my eyes and on the brow bone looks completely natural and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It reflects the light and covers about 80% of my dark circles, which is better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to get a little sharpener.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good fix for tired eyes</li>
            <li> I finally found the right product.  </li>
            <li> This pencil is very soft and creamy and not hard at all like it said in a couple of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The Eye bright pencil color I received was completely different from the one I usually buy directly from Benefit Counter.  </li>
            <li> this is what I get for thinking I could get it new one</li>
            <li> A dab of this each day, and you&#x27;ll look like a bright-eyed beauty, regardless of how little sleep you got the night before!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this little pencil!</li>
            <li> Better off using $0.99 Wet N Wild white eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The top black cap has been super glued on unevenly and does not sit flush on the pencil.</li>
            <li> It blends easily and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look dried out.  </li>
            <li> Most products cover about 20% of the dark circles, so 80% is a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Also, ended up buying the expensive $36 big beautiful eyes kit that contains the shadow liner so I could recreate the look myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have fairly large asian eyes that i wanted to accentuate without getting that \\&quot;anime doll\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li> This little item is just waht I need to make me feel confident in public.</li>
            <li> Cons are the product is really soft</li>
            <li> Again, it has to be blended well to get a natural effect instead of</li>
            <li> I have a teething seven month old, so I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my lips and around my eyes to open up the whole area.</li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s soft to the skin</li>
            <li> Works well for people sensitive to allergies.</li>
            <li> That being said, it truly does brighten the whole eye in 1/2 a second!</li>
            <li> It evens out the whole area, having it in the inner eye and browline.</li>
            <li> The brightening looks natural and doesn&#x27;t crease or cake up like concealers can sometimes do.</li>
            <li> but somehow this pencil is so smooth but firm</li>
            <li> so it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> It never goes &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in color no matter how old mine has become.  </li>
            <li> The last one I got kept breaking when I would apply it, but it&#x27;s a soft enough pencil that I can kind of squish it back together and still use it carefully.</li>
            <li> I have slight dark circles, and I wear glasses; so my eye area is pretty shady, lol.</li>
            <li> This little Eye Bright pen is like my new secret weapon, haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Eye Bright stick for a few years now, and, because you only need a little bit of this, it really does last forever.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is well worth the price since one pencil will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts long really enhances and highlights the eyebrow arc area opening up the eye.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it is so hard to find a good concealer for my extremely dark circles!  </li>
            <li> After some of the high reviews I had high hopes for this, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> This pencil is very soft, therefore you end up using and sharpening the pencil so much it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to wear make-up, but I have large pockets of fluid under my eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It definitely brightens in a natural looking way!</li>
            <li> I use it for my eyes, but also to &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; any other lines, such as laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> i have always struggled with dark under eye circles, and this product just brightened the look of my whole face!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite like the look at the store because I really noticed the pink pencil on my waterline</li>
            <li> With the hefty price tag and all of the raving reviews, I expected this pencil to perform very well.</li>
            <li> Really brightens your eyes and makes them the center of attention.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I opened this pencil to find the lead of the pencil was floating in the middle of the outter wood part.</li>
            <li> Will buy it directly from Benefit only!</li>
            <li> Also, check your makeup in natural like, I found this looked like it blended well in my bathroom mirror but had to do some additional blending once I saw myself outside.</li>
            <li> I tried Sephora&#x27;s pink eyeliner first (only $5 or $6) as another reviewer suggested and</li>
            <li> It really makes the eyes pop and will last for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing this from 4 to 3 stars after using a little longer, because now I had to seek and purchase a special sharpener for it, as it is bigger than standard eye &amp; lip liners.  </li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t crumble but not dry at all!)</li>
            <li> Like the way they conceal redness under my eyes, and the pink helps to hi light places that need a little &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Its fantastic when I&#x27;ve been traveling or just super tired!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to take too much time to gently blend so that I don&#x27;t stretch the delicate eye skin.  </li>
            <li> , however it is really large and not the average eye pencil.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dark circles under my eyes regardless of how much sleep</li>
            <li> and I have had genetic dark circles under my eyes my whole life.</li>
            <li> First of all I received the product with in a few days of ordering, it was faster than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This is part of my \\&quot;new mom routine\\&quot; for being quick applying &amp; not looking tired:</li>
            <li> The content is pretty malleable, the pencil casing scratches the sensitive eye area if you press hard enough for the product to transfer.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the inner corners of my eyes, just under my eyebrows, and I actually color in the whole dark circle under my eye, then blend the edges with my fingertip.  </li>
            <li> Really works to conceal dark circles on eyes!</li>
            <li> It is OBVIOUS that you have a thick layer of light pink makeup on, it doesn&#x27;t blend too well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a much nicer eye brightening affect with some pink concealer or just some strategically placed white eye liner, like NYX, which I use now for half the price</li>
            <li> This pencil does help my tired eyes look more wide awake, but be careful after sharpening it, it is so soft that a lot of it gets stuck while sharpening, also be careful with the pencil \\&quot;dust\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Product is too creamy, so it doesn&#x27;t last long on the inside of your eye.  </li>
            <li> You honestly do not have to put much on.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the latter for years, to blend and lighten my pink lipsticks.</li>
            <li> which will be a long time from now.</li>
            <li> Each pencil lasts a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but this and a little mascara really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit dry and chalky.</li>
            <li> The matte pink tone isn&#x27;t really pink on the skin, especially when blended in correctly.</li>
            <li> This pencil, while not a total loss is NOT worth what I paid at all.</li>
            <li> I usually touch it up once during the day, not because it&#x27;s completely gone</li>
            <li> For someone who has had genetic dark circles her entire life, this is truly a lifesaver of a product.</li>
            <li> I use concealer in the morning to cover the dark circles, but by the mid afternoon my eyes look worn out.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey little guy, but having (what feels like) 50 kids and never enough sleep, this stuff is a miracle in makeup form.</li>
            <li> I even smudge a little under my eye and blend it in so that my overall eye area looks brighter.</li>
            <li> I dab a little in the corners of my eyes, blend, and instantly look awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> its a flat, peachy colored mess, cakey and not flattering in anyway.</li>
            <li> I think they need to go back to the drawing board and fix a few issues.</li>
            <li> (Benefit makes one--the pink ball</li>
            <li> Also, be careful when you sample products in the store, esp.</li>
            <li> buyer beware this IS NOT REAL benefit makeup....</li>
            <li> so after finally getting what looked like a usable point without splinters, half the pencil was gone!</li>
            <li> Needless to say it went right in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I agree with Leanne (Oct 2010) that it seems a bit dry to blend under the eyes on dark circles.  </li>
            <li> eye.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly the same as in the stores and a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The Benefit brand sharpener that holds a fat pencil keeps it sharp and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so usually just stick to the inner eye area.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has dark circles, or tired eyes.</li>
            <li> but that would have been such a waste of even a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It was like a cheap version, a strange peachy color instead of pink white color, It didn&#x27;t do anything to enhance or brighten eyes, Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It gives a very natural finition &amp; make me look less tired.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as it&#x27;s heavily pigmented.</li>
            <li> , I have dark circles by nature, and i use this in the corner of both eyes, using a little moisturizer to help apply as it is a little bit dry.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the night before, and this lightens up those dark circles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to be worse using.</li>
            <li> I noticed a negative review that mentioned using a cheapy eyeshadow to get the same result...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally camoflauge the dark circles, but at least they are not as dark.</li>
            <li> I use it every day in my waterline in place of dark eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Brightens the eyes now I need something to hide the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been considering other options, but you can&#x27;t beat this little gem.</li>
            <li> First of all when the tip went dull, after only a few uses too, I had a heck of a time trying to sharpen the stupid thing without breaking the tip completely off  </li>
            <li> The look is very natural - not sparkly and weird.  </li>
            <li> My daughter likes the Benefit cosmetics brand, but some items are a little pricey for her.  </li>
            <li> but once I blended it a little it looked like</li>
            <li> Been using this for months and it def removed dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used a little on my brow bone, and even lined my lower kids with it.</li>
            <li> I have very dark bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was also sharpened unevenly which leads me to believe it was used.</li>
            <li> At this price, I don&#x27;t want to waste any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now.</li>
            <li> When I received it the box was definately used, not to mention the makeup inside was not sealed, it was used, and the tip for blending the makeup was missing.</li>
            <li> (and I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li> Others concealers that I have tried were either too transparent, too heavy, or too waxy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for a few years now, and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without them.  </li>
            <li> online for half price!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is hard if you keep it sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and ,based upon other reveiws, have been anxiously waiting for it to arrive!  </li>
            <li> I mean there is a VERY subtle difference when I use it, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough</li>
            <li> I apply a bit in a sideways V-shape, and then either use a small brush or my finger tip to pat it into place.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, I don&#x27;t usually use it there.  </li>
            <li> you have small lips it helps to use it underneath your lipstick - gives the illusion of fuller lips.</li>
            <li> This one is just to hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> My little beauty secret.</li>
            <li> They could have at least included a sharpener or directions on how to sharpen the thing on the box...</li>
            <li> Use in small doses!</li>
            <li> a little expensive for what it is, but I like Benefit cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> it looks really fake and silly ( think frosted pink lips, lol).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to blend in and requires a brush not just your finger.</li>
            <li> Not great by any means.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I look tired even when I&#x27;m well rested.</li>
            <li> Nobody asks if I&#x27;m tired anymore.</li>
            <li> I was unable to retrieve it and threw it in the trash...</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for an eye pencil but lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It cakes up like crazy and if you try to blend almost all of it comes off.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> And it also doubles as a concealer for any of those annoying skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I hate sharpening it though b/c i feel like it gets eatten.</li>
            <li> fake!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality control.</li>
            <li> I hated that!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its similar to Mr frosty pencils  depends your skin color is the amount you need to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use, handy to have for those quick refresh under eyes.</li>
            <li> Lid doesn&#x27;t fit/stay on.  Product is too creamy, so it doesn&#x27;t last long on the inside of your eye.  Better off using $0.99 Wet N Wild white eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the way I look well-rested when I use this concealer.  It blends easily and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look dried out.  The look is very natural - not sparkly and weird.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; either.  (yay!...I&#x27;m over 40)  I can get ready quickly by skipping eye shadow all together and just using this with some eyeliner and mascara.  (I get tons of compliments on my eye-make up when I do this, too!)  My eyes are extremely sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no troubles using the eye bright pencil either.  I only wish I had bought 2 instead of 1.</li>
            <li> I like this, I have dark circles by nature, and i use this in the corner of both eyes, using a little moisturizer to help apply as it is a little bit dry.  it does lighten the area.  a little expensive for what it is, but I like Benefit cosmetics.  I&#x27;m editing this from 4 to 3 stars after using a little longer, because now I had to seek and purchase a special sharpener for it, as it is bigger than standard eye &amp; lip liners.  I had to spend nearly as much on the sharpener as this stick cost.</li>
            <li> Eye pencil is not the right format to deliver this product.  The content is pretty malleable, the pencil casing scratches the sensitive eye area if you press hard enough for the product to transfer.  Not a quality product.  Better off purchasing the brighter in a pot (also by Benefit).  I have both.  This one is just to hard to apply.  Great color, but the application procedure makes this barely worth a 3.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with a slight olive tone.  Therefore, it is so hard to find a good concealer for my extremely dark circles!  Enter the Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright Pencil.  I put it on over my concealer.  I put it on the inner corners of my eyes, just under my eyebrows, and I actually color in the whole dark circle under my eye, then blend the edges with my fingertip.  It reflects the light and covers about 80% of my dark circles, which is better than any other product I have tried.  Most products cover about 20% of the dark circles, so 80% is a big deal to me.  I have tried expensive creams, all types of makeup, and more to no avail, until I tried this product.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the dark circles.  Until someone invents that miracle product, this is all I will use!</li>
            <li> This cannot possibly be authentic Eye Bright. The box arrived in perfect condition but when I opened it I noticed it is a used box from the bends, creases, and folds under the inside flap. It WAS NOT sealed. There was NO expiration date code, sticker or stamp. It was also sharpened unevenly which leads me to believe it was used. The top black cap has been super glued on unevenly and does not sit flush on the pencil. The lettering is all faded on the pencil itself. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and ,based upon other reveiws, have been anxiously waiting for it to arrive!  It REALLY makes the eye area look more awake,covers darkened skin and gives the illusion of a \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  I love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> Works great for lighting up your eye and makes you look younger!</li>
            <li> This pencil is very soft, therefore you end up using and sharpening the pencil so much it does not last long.  It will crease almost immediately and rubs off.  Also, does not do much brightening.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It sweats off, clogs pores, creases under eyes and doesn&#x27;t fit into any cosmetic pencil sharpener I&#x27;ve ever encountered--and I have encountered many. Does it brighten eyes? Yes. But it does more harm than good. If you want my advice, try Benefit Cosmetics Erase Paste. It stays better longer and is better for the skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the Benefit cosmetics brand, but some items are a little pricey for her.  This item is exactly the same as in the stores and a little less expensive.  Very happy with it and received in timeframe.</li>
            <li> Works well at Defining your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This pencil, while not a total loss is NOT worth what I paid at all. First of all when the tip went dull, after only a few uses too, I had a heck of a time trying to sharpen the stupid thing without breaking the tip completely off  so after finally getting what looked like a usable point without splinters, half the pencil was gone! They could have at least included a sharpener or directions on how to sharpen the thing on the box...&lt;br /&gt;Ok,  the product itself, meh...it looked nice when I first put it on but once I blended it a little it looked like nothing was even there anymore and had no affect. So tried again with a primer, same thing, looked like it disappeared into my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a much nicer eye brightening affect with some pink concealer or just some strategically placed white eye liner, like NYX, which I use now for half the price and it actually works.</li>
            <li> this product was awesome! i have always struggled with dark under eye circles, and this product just brightened the look of my whole face! it helped me gain confidence :)</li>
            <li> This pencil is very soft and creamy and not hard at all like it said in a couple of the reviews. Perhaps it is hard if you keep it sharp. I wasn&#x27;t sold at first when I went to the Benefit counter and applied it to my lower waterlines. It really stood out (I applied a lot by accident). Luckily, the makeup artist showed me how to apply it to the inner and outer corners of my eyes like arrows. She also applied it under my eyebrow but I don&#x27;t really need that as much since I have highlighters. She applied the Benefit shadow liner (comes in a kit) with a slant tip makeup brush under my lower waterlines to show me that liner would really stand out with the Eye Bright pencil. I didn&#x27;t quite like the look at the store because I really noticed the pink pencil on my waterline so I left, but when I got home, I realized (at night) how great the Eye Bright pencil is on the lower waterlines!!! I ran back out to buy it the same night. Also, ended up buying the expensive $36 big beautiful eyes kit that contains the shadow liner so I could recreate the look myself. Eyeliner smears on my eyes (and looks harsher than the shadow liner). I have been having fun this morning putting the Eye Bright pencil everywhere on my face: on the browbone as a highlighter, in the inner corners of my eyes, outer corners, on the lower waterline, then below the shadow liner as a concealer. The other reviews are right that this is a fabulous concealer too! I just used it under my eyes (on top of foundation) for extra brightness and on my red acne scar spots! I will be using this Eye Bright stick all the time and will be carrying it around in my purse to reapply it during the day on my lower waterlines when needed. If you put it on your lower waterlines, just blink a few times to soften it (or you might have applied too much like I did at the store). I am 34 and really, really wish I had discovered Eye Bright when I was younger. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the money but I think it is well worth the price since one pencil will last you a very long time. I tried Sephora&#x27;s pink eyeliner first (only $5 or $6) as another reviewer suggested and I didn&#x27;t like it (but that&#x27;s on my face). I also tried another brand at Sephora and that one didn&#x27;t look good as well. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a cheap white eyeliner at a drugstore as one reviewer suggested. I almost did but that would have been such a waste of even a few bucks. The reason why this Eye Bright pencil works so well is the specific pink shade of color. Highly recommend it, but suggest you go to a Benefit makeup counter or Sephora and have it applied on you first to try it. If your Benefit makeup artist doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s doing, go find another one. One artist was awesome but the other one didn&#x27;t know about all the uses of Eye Bright and tried to sell me a cheek highlighter which is NOT what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great....</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH! It actually does what its supposed to do! I will be bying this agan when I run out</li>
            <li> Very nice shade of light pink. It works under the brow line. I have used in corner of eyes and underneath to get a more youthful dewy appearance. It works well! You do need a LARGE pencil sharpener for this product.</li>
            <li> I like the IDEA of this makeup pencil and generally this brand is wonderful. Cons are the product is really soft so it goes fast, and it does not come with a pencil sharpener, which would be fine, however it is really large and not the average eye pencil. I think if I was able to USE it and it was not so soft, it could be a great product. I think they need to go back to the drawing board and fix a few issues.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good tested it as soon as I recieved  it&#x27;s a good fix for tired eyes it brightened my eye area gave me a diff look I like I&#x27;d say def give it a try  for added brightness came fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Eye Bright stick for a few years now, and, because you only need a little bit of this, it really does last forever.  The Benefit brand sharpener that holds a fat pencil keeps it sharp and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly in the inner corners/tear ducts of my eyes. I apply a bit in a sideways V-shape, and then either use a small brush or my finger tip to pat it into place.  I&#x27;ve also tried it under the arch of my brows and at the outside corner, but tend to be rushed in the morning, so usually just stick to the inner eye area.  It brightens that whole area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers mentioned that they use this under their eyes, too; I&#x27;ve never tried that before since it seems like the pencil would be too drying to smooth into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, this is pricey, but it&#x27;s one beauty product that is a must-have!  A dab of this each day, and you&#x27;ll look like a bright-eyed beauty, regardless of how little sleep you got the night before!  :-)</li>
            <li> I use in inner corners of eyes to hide darkness. Goes on without dragging and I put my makeup on over it. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and puffy bags under my eyes. I bought this a while back and didn&#x27;t like it so back to my makeup pile it went. More recently I was cleaning things out and decided to give it another shot. This time around, I really liked it. It&#x27;s really important that your skin be moisturized, otherwise it isn&#x27;t going to blend properly. I like to draw lines around my eyes, a bit on the inside corners, then some under my eye brows to make them look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, a big problem with this product is the difficulty with sharpening. I went all over Sephora trying to find one that worked. Finally, the Cover Girl one that a friend left at my house worked but then I lost it! At this price, I don&#x27;t want to waste any.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BENEFIT \\&quot;STICKS THERE THE BEST AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  NICE PRICE TOO I CAN NOW STOCK UP</li>
            <li> I got the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil in a Benefit kit at a Paris Sephora.  Didn&#x27;t even use it for several months but glad I got to try something I otherwise would not have purchased.  I love kits.  I agree with Leanne (Oct 2010) that it seems a bit dry to blend under the eyes on dark circles.  I feel like I have to take too much time to gently blend so that I don&#x27;t stretch the delicate eye skin.  (I&#x27;m 52, light complexion, oily combo skin) For that reason, I don&#x27;t usually use it there.  It might different if I use liquid foundation which is more moist instead of mineral powder (I use the pencil on top of foundation).  There are soft highlighting powders that work better to brighten under the eyes (Benefit makes one--the pink ball w/ the fan brush.  I use Mally&#x27;s).  But it is handy in a purse for touch ups and sometimes I use it for the inner corners of my eyes.  Again, it has to be blended well to get a natural effect instead of a painted on look.  So use a light hand.      Also, be careful when you sample products in the store, esp. for your eyes, or you&#x27;ll pick up germs or an infection.  I would advise against using a store sample on your eyes&#x27; waterlines, even if you sharpen it to peel off the outer layer.</li>
            <li> The tip fell into the pencil and that was that.  I was unable to retrieve it and threw it in the trash...so done with that product.</li>
            <li> This is very subtle but the effect is great.  I use a bit on the inner corners of my eyes to look more awake.  It brightens my eyes right up.  This is part of my \\&quot;new mom routine\\&quot; for being quick applying &amp; not looking tired: You Rebel Light, Boing Concealer, Get Even powder, and Eye Bright.  I have a teething seven month old, so I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> Love these pencils, I have purchased before and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> After some of the high reviews I had high hopes for this, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me as I expected. I prefer my Rimmel white Kohl eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I put this on the inner part of my eye lids, then at the inner corner of each eye &amp; I use it to highlight my eyebrows &amp; above the middle part of my upper lip. Works great! Makes my eyes look nice &amp; bright. Gives my whole face the extra pop I need to look fresh &amp; awake.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product - however, it tends to go on more cakey than creamy. It is OBVIOUS that you have a thick layer of light pink makeup on, it doesn&#x27;t blend too well.</li>
            <li> This pencil is OK. Not great by any means. With the hefty price tag and all of the raving reviews, I expected this pencil to perform very well. I was disappointed. It cakes up like crazy and if you try to blend almost all of it comes off. I mean there is a VERY subtle difference when I use it, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough that I will spend my money on it again.</li>
            <li> I have very dark bags under my eyes. I used this then put my foundation on and you couldn&#x27;t see them any more. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a true wake-me-up product.  I have somewhat red eyes most of the time, and this product, when used on the rim of my eyelid, from the inside corner to the pupil, top and bottom, and then my dark liner on the outer corner to the pupil, it gives that wide-awake bright eye look, even when I&#x27;m lacking sleep.  A great product that blends beautifully and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This pencil is amazing. I typically do a low key make-up look, and this product on the inner corners of my eyes and on the brow bone looks completely natural and gorgeous. I also use this on my cupids bow and long the lower lip line to enhance lip fullness-just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> First of all I received the product with in a few days of ordering, it was faster than I thought it would be and I was very happy about that. The product itself is amazing. Really brightens your eyes and makes them the center of attention. As a Photographer I use it much of the time for my shoots and it really makes the eyes in every picture stand out. I don&#x27;t have a sharpener for this product but if I use a knife the pencil is soft enough you can sharpen it very easily. Recommend as a must have for your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I love the brightness it gives to my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for anyone. It brightens and makes your eyes have that come hither look we all want . I even use it on my lips and around my eyes to open up the whole area. You will look like a living doll .</li>
            <li> I was tired of trying to use some kind of shimmery eyeshadow to highlight my eyes like some kind of 14 year old. I saw this product recommended on a blog, and I will definitely buy again (in a couple years when it runs out... use it every day and have only sharpened once in the 2-3 months I&#x27;ve had it). I love this. Not too shimmery &amp; not obvious (when blended obviously) and I use it under the upper brows for highlight and inside corners of my eyes as well. LOVE this pencil.</li>
            <li> This pencil is fabulous. It really makes a huge difference in looking more awake and refreshed. I use it on the inside corner of my eyes as well as below the arch of my eyebrows and above the arches. It blends well and isn&#x27;t shimmery. A little goes a long way as it&#x27;s heavily pigmented. The matte pink tone isn&#x27;t really pink on the skin, especially when blended in correctly. I also have Benefit&#x27;s Ooh La Lift, and IMO, Eye Bright works a helluva lot better and stays all day. Sometimes I use them both with just using the Ooh La Lift on my under eye area on days I didn&#x27;t get much sleep. Eye Bright is definitely a must have product for me now, and I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase when this pencil is done, which won&#x27;t be for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It did not cover the problem like I wanted it to.  I saw a video on Youtube where the girl used it and it looked great on her.  I tried to put it on and it would not blend in like it should.  If you put it on with the pencil, you can&#x27;t blend it from the pencil mark.  All you have it that pencil mark&#x27;s worth on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Much cheaper than Sephora! It lasts a lot longer than I anticipated. I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I would not have thought using a white liner on my waterline would make such a big difference!  While my eyes look noticeabley different when I use this pencil, it isn&#x27;t obvious to others what the difference is.  I suppose that is the whole point of using makeup. My eyes look bigger and I do look more awake.  This Benefit pencil goes on very smoothly but don&#x27;t put it on after your mascara or you end up with sci-fi lashes that look like they are floating away from your lower lid.  This pencil is going to outlast me because it is rather large compared to the amount used each day.  It isn&#x27;t often you can say that about a product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite must.  It is great for every complexion. It won´t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a big open, rested eye.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The makeup was supposed to be new! When I received it the box was definately used, not to mention the makeup inside was not sealed, it was used, and the tip for blending the makeup was missing. I will never buy makeup online from another person claiming there products are so called \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;!  Needless to say it went right in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love this eye bright pencil! I suffer from dark circles under my eyes regardless of how much sleep I have gotten the night before, and this lightens up those dark circles. The last one I got kept breaking when I would apply it, but it&#x27;s a soft enough pencil that I can kind of squish it back together and still use it carefully. This is my third stick and I have never had this problem before. I will continue buying it!</li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s soft to the skin</li>
            <li> This is the second time i buy it. Lasts long really enhances and highlights the eyebrow arc area opening up the eye. Simply put i love it</li>
            <li> Love this eye pencil from Benefit nothing quite like it however if your on a budget, it is too pricey.</li>
            <li> One benefits long time great products. Was as described.</li>
            <li> Been using this for months and it def removed dark circles under my eyes! I&#x27;m very tan which I thought was going to be a problem but just had to blend it in and it works great! Def works for any skin tone! Blend it in is the technique!</li>
            <li> I use to use this pencil under my eyebrow to highlight my eyes. It was good while I had it, but I&#x27;ve found another product in a crème that my fair, dry skin prefers both under and above my eyes. This stick was a good highlighter, but I could never have used a hard stick on my sensitive skin under my eyes to conceal shadows. Other buyers may have great use for this product. I used it, then moved on to something that served my special needs more. Nothing wrong with this product. I used it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to be worse using. It ended up in the makeup pile of stuff I will never use. Oh well.</li>
            <li> The best is all i can say about this product makes eyes pop  I would recommend using a make up finishing spray with this product.. I highly recommend this product brightens up eyes better than any other product i have ever used...&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this product again and again..dont hesitate to order it</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I opened this pencil to find the lead of the pencil was floating in the middle of the outter wood part. Terrible quality control. Returning the item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color and looks great to help the eyes to pop but it&#x27;s a bit dry and chalky. Also the lid didn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on which my be the reason for the dryness.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy-breezy, professional brand. Works well for people sensitive to allergies. Pleasant consistency and scent. Works perfectly for highlighting around eyes or as pale pink lipstick that stays put all day or night. I have used it for the latter for years, to blend and lighten my pink lipsticks. My little beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reviewing a make- up book that gave tips on tools to use for a basic look every day. I was amazed at all the reviews there were for this item (which brought me to purchasing this item), however, I believe it&#x27;s not as easy to use as people make it to be...     If used correctly this item gets the job done, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was exactly worth the price of the product.... (and I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li> This is a pricey little guy, but having (what feels like) 50 kids and never enough sleep, this stuff is a miracle in makeup form. I did notice that if you don&#x27;t wipe away any mis-landed eyeshadow/eyeliner, it gets on the Eye Bright and makes it smeary. (That&#x27;s probably an obvious tip) That being said, it truly does brighten the whole eye in 1/2 a second! I noticed a negative review that mentioned using a cheapy eyeshadow to get the same result... I agree that this isn&#x27;t the &#x27;only&#x27; product that can be used on the inner eye- which is what I used to do. It never stayed longer than an hour, and this stuff stays put for hours! I usually touch it up once during the day, not because it&#x27;s completely gone but because I just want to re-brighten!     Also, I haven&#x27;t seen other reviews mention this, but I also put the Eye Bright under the outer eyebrow to lighten and brighen there! And I LOVE it! It evens out the whole area, having it in the inner eye and browline. It really does awaken the eyes!! Get it! ;)</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really makes the eyes pop and will last for a VERY long time. It&#x27;s the perfect color for its purpose. Will buy more once out....which will be a long time from now.</li>
            <li> This pencil is a godsend! The pencil glides on easy leaving, blends amazingly and gives a brightening effect that leaves you looking well rested and ready for whatever the day has to offer. For someone who has had genetic dark circles her entire life, this is truly a lifesaver of a product. The brightening looks natural and doesn&#x27;t crease or cake up like concealers can sometimes do. I will buy this product again and again. I am extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this! I have been so happy I got it. It really wakes up my eyes and I get complimented all the time! I use it on my brow bone and tear duct. Awesome results!</li>
            <li> This is everything they said. Love it. Use it every day. Will be buying this again. So happy with it</li>
            <li> The Eye bright pencil color I received was completely different from the one I usually buy directly from Benefit Counter.  It was like a cheap version, a strange peachy color instead of pink white color, It didn&#x27;t do anything to enhance or brighten eyes, Very disappointed. I usually love this pencil, wonderful pick me up, but I would not purchase this product again from Amazon. Will buy it directly from Benefit only!</li>
            <li> i cannot figure out what the difference is between this and so many other cream shadows, liners, highlighters, etc.  but somehow this pencil is so smooth but firm (doesn&#x27;t crumble but not dry at all!) and it instantly highlights and brightens but without the white effect or the shimmery, glittery effect.  so it looks completely natural.  it disappars into your skin but still brightens. i am in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have fairly large asian eyes that i wanted to accentuate without getting that \\&quot;anime doll\\&quot; look... this does just that!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to wear make-up, but I have large pockets of fluid under my eyes and dark circles. This little item is just waht I need to make me feel confident in public. It doesn&#x27;t totally camoflauge the dark circles, but at least they are not as dark. I really like this product. Others concealers that I have tried were either too transparent, too heavy, or too waxy. This one is just perfect. It works very well as an accent under the outer brow line too. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but this and a little mascara really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help brighten my eye area.  So far haven&#x27;t noticed anything to amazing, but I think I need to use more of the product to get the desired effect.  Also, check your makeup in natural like, I found this looked like it blended well in my bathroom mirror but had to do some additional blending once I saw myself outside.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying this pencil. the reviews are usually right on. This pencil brightens your eyes makes you look younger. makes your eye POP!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it every day in my waterline in place of dark eyeliner. It brightens the eyes and takes them from 6 a.m. to noon in 5 seconds! I&#x27;ll never go without this again.</li>
            <li> This pencil does help my tired eyes look more wide awake, but be careful after sharpening it, it is so soft that a lot of it gets stuck while sharpening, also be careful with the pencil \\&quot;dust\\&quot; so it doesn&#x27;t go in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks good for the first hour, but my experience is that it starts creasing and has an obvious look.  Maybe it&#x27;s the hot climate or my watery eyes, but just thought I&#x27;d post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it, but will probably experiment with a different product next time.</li>
            <li> I love the way it helps with shaping my eyebrows and highlighting them.  A must have for eyebrow shaping.  The packaging was good and I received it right on time.  Very happy with this eye bright.</li>
            <li> It really does reflect the light upwards, making eye circles invisible, especially in flash photos! I love this little pencil! I only use it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to any girl&#x27;s makeup bag. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with it. It&#x27;s my favorite eye highlighter. It&#x27;s soft and blends very nicely. It&#x27;s shimmery and catches the light perfectly. I use it every day. I also put some on my cheeks to highlight them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite must buy!</li>
            <li> I dab some of this on either side of my eyes in the morning and it really draws attention away from the tiredness in my face. I get compliments on my eyes every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie, and I had to have this. I have slight dark circles, and I wear glasses; so my eye area is pretty shady, lol. It&#x27;s very creamy, blends well, and it work WONDERS! I&#x27;ve even used a little on my brow bone, and even lined my lower kids with it. I look AWAKE again!! It&#x27;s a keeper for sure😊😍</li>
            <li> I love the Eye Bright Pencil! I wear it on the inner part of my lower eye lid and it stays there all day. I even smudge a little under my eye and blend it in so that my overall eye area looks brighter. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am of a darker color and I dont think it looks good with my eyes, its too white but it would make for a good brow highlight.</li>
            <li> This pencil is a LIFESAVER.. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it for years and with amazon pricing I finally ordered it. I dab a little in the corners of my eyes, blend, and instantly look awake and refreshed. It draws attention to my eyes in a way nothing else does. Its fantastic when I&#x27;ve been traveling or just super tired!!</li>
            <li> This is a great &amp;#34;concealer/brightener&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.  Each pencil lasts a long time, too.  It never goes &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in color no matter how old mine has become.  I use it for my eyes, but also to &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; any other lines, such as laugh lines.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have light tan olive skin with darker brown hair. I found this pencil to be fairly pale/cool pink for my tone.&lt;br /&gt; It is pretty, bright and light. I love the consistency and the size is nice. I can use it, but I must apply with a really light hand other wise it looks really fake and silly ( think frosted pink lips, lol).&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to Ulta and tried out the Gilded Highlighting pencil- I would def recommend that color over this one for people with more tan or olive tones. I am going to purchase the Gilded and give this light pink one to my daughter. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to brighten my eyes.  I finally found the right product.  Benefit&#x27;s Eye Bright Pencil is truly amazing how it brightens my eyes.  After I put on my eye makeup, I apply pencil to the bottom of the inside lid.  That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to order more while they are still in stock.</li>
            <li> I recently received my eye pencil, and am simply in love with it.  Its great for the inner corners of the eye as well as under eye circles.  I also used it as a highlighting pencil. It&#x27;s really a very flattering color, so much better then those white pencils that are out there......ladies,buy this one, you will love!!</li>
            <li> Love this authentic eye bright pencil and received it really quickly from best sales ever dealer:) It gives a very natural finition &amp; make me look less tired.</li>
            <li> So, I am in love with this pencil. I wasn&#x27;t sure how big of a difference it would make, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It is awesome. It really perks up my eyes and does away with any redness. Recieved product super fast as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I have very fair skin, and dark circles under my eyes. Im 26 and I have had genetic dark circles under my eyes my whole life. Because of this, I look tired even when I&#x27;m well rested. I use concealer in the morning to cover the dark circles, but by the mid afternoon my eyes look worn out. This stuff is perfect for the afternoon! That way you dont risk messing up your makeup with more concealer (getting too cakey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides right on the skin in the corners of the eyes, then a quick little smudge with a q tip or finger, and Im good to go for the rest of the day! I highly recommend this to anyone who has dark circles, or tired eyes. It definitely brightens in a natural looking way!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Really brightens up the eyes!</li>
            <li> I gotta say, this is hands down the best eye brightning pencil I have found over the years. You honestly do not have to put much on. It doesn&#x27;t have a cakey texture either, making it even more wonderful. I will say if you put a lot on, it will have a tendency to make it look as if you&#x27;re downplaying clown makeup. Use in small doses! The last time I purchased this @ Ulta, I paid close to $20, so the price is unbeatable as well! And it also doubles as a concealer for any of those annoying skin imperfections. Since it&#x27;s a pencil, you can dab it right on &amp; when you put your foundation on, it really camoflauges!</li>
            <li> I have red circles under my eyes and this helps hide that and putting it on your lips before applying lip stick helps get a truer shade from your lip color.</li>
            <li> Makes me look bright and awake! Love this product and can be used in various ways and areas of the face!</li>
            <li> A welcome change to black eyeliner.  This brightens my brown eyes and makes them pop!  Love this product and will forever be keeping it in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade for highlighting</li>
            <li> Pretty good for around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this product. works so well, I actually look awake. You tube has a video that shows how &amp; where to apply it. It is very simple. Brow bone,inner eye &amp; outer eye corners. It&#x27;s very easy to blend. I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain about it.</li>
            <li> love the pencil easy to use. Brightens the eyes now I need something to hide the dark circles. Ideas? Lol</li>
            <li> It IS light, but even though you&#x27;re not supposed to go any lighter under the eye than the rest of your face, I actually prefer to. (Just a teensy bit.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now.  I love it so much I always keep a spare pencil laying around somewhere.  I find it best to use my finger when blending this product vs. a sponge.  Found the sponge would take too much off.  Works well and gives me a lift so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Received product expeditiously. So far, great product at much more reasonable price than Sephora or expensive department store.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference...</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s matte not shimmer, as I use it as a highlight above the eyebrow for a brighter, lifted look. I also use it on the inside corner of the eye, underneath my Laura Geller Wonder Wand Eye Brightener (helps the ww last longer). It&#x27;s regular $20 at my local Ulta store but I found it on Amazon for $12 so I just had to try it! I also find it sharpens best with my Urban Decay Grindhouse Double Barrel Sharpener. Great product I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The last one I bought in 2004 and it just died. It&#x27;s expensive for an eye pencil but lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;In the corners of your eyes it gives a look of brightness. In a pinch it can be a light concealer.&lt;br /&gt;If you have small lips it helps to use it underneath your lipstick - gives the illusion of fuller lips.</li>
            <li> Originally I had the eye bright in the travel boing set and I did like it. I didn&#x27;t think it was quite worth the $20 you have to pay in store and so I looked online. Glad I did as it was much cheaper. The product itself is just as good, but I did find the black siding chipped quite a bit when I would put the cap on. Not a deal breaker since the product is the real thing and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> way too light and I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the inner corners of my eyes to make my sleep deprived eyes look alert. I rarely have to sharpen it. It lasts a very long time. I will repurchase this item too.</li>
            <li> Nobody asks if I&#x27;m tired anymore. I hated that! This little Eye Bright pen is like my new secret weapon, haha. I&#x27;d been considering other options, but you can&#x27;t beat this little gem. Super fast shipping, great customer service, why are you still reading? Go buy one before I buy them all up.</li>
            <li> Make sure to get a little sharpener.  You will love this.</li>
            <li> Really works to conceal dark circles on eyes! Excellent and easy to use and lasts all day long without smudging!</li>
            <li> fake!!! buyer beware this IS NOT REAL benefit makeup....trust me I have used this product for years and this cheap knockoff is a joke compared to their real makeup. faded lettering on pencil and product has zero shimmer. its a flat, peachy colored mess, cakey and not flattering in anyway. go into any Sephora and swatch the real one yourself. great product if its real. this is what I get for thinking I could get it new one online for half price! ha</li>
            <li> Been using these for a few years now, and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without them.  Like the way they conceal redness under my eyes, and the pink helps to hi light places that need a little &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love high lighters for the area around my eyes and just below my eyebrow. This pencil does the trick and is not sticky or greasy. It&#x27;s tough to blend in and requires a brush not just your finger. I&#x27;ve used many high lighters from many different brands before. My other favorite high lighter is by Stila.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years! It is quite possibly my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li> I love this! I draw a line under each eyebrow and blend with my fingers and do the same for the inside corners of my eyes. It makes you seem well rested and youthful. Easy to  use, great tool!</li>
            <li> Helps brighten up the eyes i even use it at times as a eyeliner. I hate sharpening it though b/c i feel like it gets eatten.</li>
            <li> Great product, a must have. Very versatile. Shipped promptly. Great experience.</li>
