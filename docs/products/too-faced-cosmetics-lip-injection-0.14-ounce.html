    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this !</li>
            <li>I am tan and it is a perfect color for my skin tone for an every day look.</li>
            <li>I must honestly say that this is the Best Lip plumper i have ever tried</li>
            <li>but i like it lol</li>
            <li>This Lip Injection works great on my lips.</li>
            <li>:-P</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>But I guess I&#x27;d rather have my lips look fuller more than I want their color to match my nail color!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I will buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>, my lips turned a nice color of \\&quot;flush\\&quot; and the gloss is shiny.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my lip size, please know this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>it is nice...</li>
            <li>This product arrived packaged perfect, and it really works, it has a peppermint taste to it with some spice, it does plump the lips</li>
            <li>Best lip plumber I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>I consider this item to be nothing more than a lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>and i love it!!!1</li>
            <li>Lip plumping glosses from Walmart or target work better than this one.</li>
            <li>still i didnt see any product better ....</li>
            <li>I love Too</li>
            <li>then it stops and your left with beautiful fuller glossy lips!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lip glosses in plumping terms.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t met another lip plumper that could do better.</li>
            <li>Buxom lip gloss is so much better</li>
            <li>(  For the price, I would have hoped that the manufacturer could have come up with a better brush.</li>
            <li>, i love this product and plan to keep it on hand ..</li>
            <li>Shows just cause it costs more</li>
            <li>I can get better results by putting hot wing sauce on lips!  </li>
            <li>its nice and reasonable</li>
            <li>someone who always gets the cheap makeup</li>
            <li>/&gt;The delivery was speedy, and tracking was constantly available.</li>
            <li>Anyway, you need to find it cheap and try it out yourself.</li>
            <li>It costs maybe $3 dollars and does the same thing but actually is a great color payoff..  </li>
            <li>Quite high priced and we did not find it effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I resisted buying this one for so long, probably because the reviews weren&#x27;t that great, but this is the strongest.</li>
            <li>it full my lips temporary</li>
            <li>Hubby and I got a good laugh over it - but never used it again (for obvious reasons)...</li>
            <li>My wife, while searching through the different cosmetic products came upon this lip injection and was excited to own one of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed this is no longer a Subscribe &amp; Save item!</li>
            <li>injection is not at all worth its value.</li>
            <li>, they are so worth the money.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Burns for a minute or so, but my results were worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a decent product, but more effective for giving your lips a little color and fullness than for truly plumping them.</li>
            <li>It reacts with your lip to enhance a natural flushed colour and fuller look - gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;With a sweet, candy-like smell, this lip gloss is deicious to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Great value!</li>
            <li>Actually my sister liked it so much</li>
            <li>Oh...and the shipping cost was nearly as much as the product!</li>
            <li>It is also the chemical found in hot peppers, hence the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>sometimes its hot on lips</li>
            <li>It does burn, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty used to it now, and I find myself rather liking the tingle.</li>
            <li>I do not want any more Two faced products or any further charges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great clear lip gloss...rich and lasts a long time, but as far as plumping?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lip Injection&#x27;s plumping effect lis mild at best, but the natural flush it causes is something so hard to replicate in regular gloss, lipstick, or tint.</li>
            <li>So, very hilarious but use this power with caution so that you don&#x27;t get in trouble.</li>
            <li>I have always had lips on the medium to large side which may be why this product works for me.</li>
            <li>You can buy it in a very lightly tinted pink too.</li>
            <li>I really believed the Harpers Bazaar article about this item plumping up lips...</li>
            <li>i got the box with absolutely nothing in it.</li>
            <li>Didnt really do much to my lips , it just irritated them .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product feels gooey and sticky on my lips, It&#x27;s very glossy, but doesn&#x27;t plump much at all.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>I can imagine that people with sensitive skin (especially on the lips) would experience a bit more during use.</li>
            <li>and i recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I did not experience much lip plumping, but it did make my lips a really pretty red color for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It starts working almost immediately and has a nice, subtle aroma.</li>
            <li>It only stings a little bit, more of a tingle, really.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it plumps, but it does seem to bring more color to the lips immediately.</li>
            <li>those first few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll put this on first thing after washing my face, and by the time I&#x27;m done with the rest of my moisturizing/eye makeup/foundation process, my lips are ready to put gloss or lipstick on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky like every other gloss in the world, but about 2 or 3 minutes after applying it this natural just-bit-my-lip red shade has taken over my lips, which I just love.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference with this product, but my aunt who has natural fuller lips thought my lips were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips really soft and its a pretty lipgloss, but it didn&#x27;t do as much plumping as I expected.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth really stand out while still looking like I&#x27;m just wearing clear gloss (since I definitely prefer the no makeup look).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just look like a five year old whose parents haven&#x27;t taught them how to put on chapstick during the winter season.  </li>
            <li>Also use with caution if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have thin lips and find this product works nicely to fill them out for a bit.</li>
            <li>This gloss literally lasts me about 2 hours which I think is good because every lipgloss I get expensive or drugstore</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better...</li>
            <li>I already have full lips, this does give a slightly &#x27;plumper&#x27; appearance</li>
            <li>I have small lips and try many different things.</li>
            <li>While the sensation is normal, if you have sensitive skin you might want to make a test before actually using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it helps keep my lips full and without those little wrinkles around some peoples lips.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I like to mess with my husband, giving him a big old kiss right after I put this on and giggling at his duck lips for the next half-hour.</li>
            <li>I think the most dramatic swelling happens in the first half-hour or so, and after that my lips settle down into a plumped-but-not-crazy look.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this lip injection in England a few years ago and it lasted ages.</li>
            <li>This item does what it says, i.e., plumps your lips, but unfortunately the brush that is used to apply it is of such poor quality that every time I use it, more and more of the brush strands come off and get stuck on my lips . . .</li>

            <li> There is a slight tingling sensation, but if you have used a lip plumper before you know this is normal.</li>
            <li> Have realistic expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, love this product will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I think she was expecting me to look like she naturally is (sometimes people like that tend to put you down).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but its worth it, it makes your lips sting for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Granted I am an older woman with the cracks around my lips but usually gloss does not bleed into them like this one does.</li>
            <li> and when I put this product on it remind me of the way my lips look especially plump and pink after.</li>
            <li> My lips are not on the very thin side, but I don&#x27;t have full lips either, I just have regular lips.</li>
            <li> It plumps my lips a little bit, and makes them a little redder and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very little bit in order for it to work, so this should last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this is the one thing I have to spend the extra few $$$ on</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful with your SO when using this.</li>
            <li> not as other said...</li>
            <li> All other lip plumpers I have used don&#x27;t cause this swollen look to my lips.</li>
            <li> It plumps your lips and works for hours, however, the only complaint I have is that the container leaked.</li>
            <li> not a fun task to remove them:-</li>
            <li> Slight tingling when you put it on</li>
            <li> The stinging wasn&#x27;t bad at all, but the results are entirely minimal and kind of silly.  </li>
            <li> Not true</li>
            <li> do not have sensitive skin in the least, and I could feel a slightly uncomfortable tingling for a short time while using the product.</li>
            <li> For my friend who tried it with small lips, not much happened.</li>
            <li> But I was not impressed with how long the effect lasts, which is only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work like other lip plumpers I&#x27;ve gotten in the past</li>
            <li> If you want something that does a little just like this</li>
            <li> The lip plumper works for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money and time on this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip plumper for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> The rash disappeared after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The lip injection is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This does very little and has no color.. WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> In general not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if I can put lip color on with it.  </li>
            <li> Left a weird taste on my lips.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a common occurrence.</li>
            <li> It tingles your lips  and turns them crazy red and poof</li>
            <li> It is really thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculous.  </li>

            <li> which also helps prevent cold sores too.</li>

            <li> Best lip plumber I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> My wife, while searching through the different cosmetic products came upon this lip injection and was excited to own one of it. We ordered the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This injection is not at all worth its value. Quite high priced and we did not find it effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dejected and disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I waited 3 weeks to receive it, just to be disappointed....It really only lasts an hour. You need to constantly reapply. I will not reorder</li>
            <li> I consider this item to be nothing more than a lip gloss.  Save your money and just purchase a lip gloss for one fourth the cost.</li>
            <li> The lip plumper works for a few minutes, my lips turned a nice color of \\&quot;flush\\&quot; and the gloss is shiny. But I was not impressed with how long the effect lasts, which is only a few minutes. I also noticed that the gloss will \\&quot;bleed\\&quot; into the cracks of my lips. Granted I am an older woman with the cracks around my lips but usually gloss does not bleed into them like this one does. In general not impressed with this product. It does not plump to the extent I was expecting. Oh...and the shipping cost was nearly as much as the product!</li>
            <li> This is okay. It is really thick and sticky. Not sure if it plumps, but it does seem to bring more color to the lips immediately.</li>
            <li> I really believed the Harpers Bazaar article about this item plumping up lips...WRONG!  I can get better results by putting hot wing sauce on lips!  Felt nothing when I put it on..waste of money. It&#x27;s a great clear lip gloss...rich and lasts a long time, but as far as plumping?  NO!  Don&#x27;t waste money and time on this product.</li>
            <li> The stinging wasn&#x27;t bad at all, but the results are entirely minimal and kind of silly.  You&#x27;ll just look like a five year old whose parents haven&#x27;t taught them how to put on chapstick during the winter season.  Or, like you have a cranberry juice mustache.  This product is ridiculous.  Save your money for a lip injection if you&#x27;re that worried about the size of you dumb lips.</li>
            <li> I have small lips and try many different things. I must honestly say that this is the Best Lip plumper i have ever tried and i love it!!!1 Never stop making it please! Thank you and i recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. It is way to sticky. It burns your lips and does nothing for plumping them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip plumper for a few weeks.  It only stings a little bit, more of a tingle, really.  It plumps my lips a little bit, and makes them a little redder and very shiny.  But I&#x27;m not sure if I can put lip color on with it.  But I guess I&#x27;d rather have my lips look fuller more than I want their color to match my nail color!</li>
            <li> It surprises me to read all the reviews for this product complaining about the burning/tingling sensation this product causes. The packaging says to expect this, as OTC plumpers like Lip Injection contain capsaicin to stimulate blood flow and a plumping effect. It is also the chemical found in hot peppers, hence the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; effect. If the burning sensation is what&#x27;s bothering you, OTC products probably aren&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip Injection&#x27;s plumping effect lis mild at best, but the natural flush it causes is something so hard to replicate in regular gloss, lipstick, or tint. I have thin lips and find this product works nicely to fill them out for a bit. Because it&#x27;s not meant to be long-lasting, I don&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, but to dress up for events or dates. The packaging gives it about four hours of effectiveness, which is generous. When I wear it I reapply every hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent product, but more effective for giving your lips a little color and fullness than for truly plumping them.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It plumps your lips and works for hours, however, the only complaint I have is that the container leaked. Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a common occurrence.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my lip size, please know this is an awesome product. Maybe it helps keep my lips full and without those little wrinkles around some peoples lips. I have been using this for about 2 years. I can&#x27;t wait to get it on my lips in the mornings. Awesome stuff. You can buy it in a very lightly tinted pink too. Alta has it.</li>
            <li> Left a weird taste on my lips. Like if I took a drink of something it tasted masted. And it did not plump my lips at all. Lip plumping glosses from Walmart or target work better than this one. Waste of money</li>
            <li> too faced..it is nice...it full my lips temporary not as other said...its nice and reasonable if  i want to go out ..may i ll ask it again coz still i didnt see any product better ....sometimes its hot on lips but i like it lol</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced products, they are so worth the money. I first purchased this lip injection in England a few years ago and it lasted ages. When I went to purchase another one they stopped selling it and the only place I could find it was here on amazon. It&#x27;s not cheap but its worth it, it makes your lips sting for a few minutes then it stops and your left with beautiful fuller glossy lips!</li>
            <li> looooooove this stuff&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone who always gets the cheap makeup but this is the one thing I have to spend the extra few $$$ on, it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> Not the size I thought it was but reply works my lips are 3x bigger. I am very happy with this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed this is no longer a Subscribe &amp; Save item! This is one of my favorite lip glosses in plumping terms. I use it before I put on a color or even by itself.&lt;br /&gt;It tingles, it might sting if you just brushed your teeth or cleaned your lips...but it&#x27;s worth it. It works well and I haven&#x27;t met another lip plumper that could do better.</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff works!!! It tingles your lips  and turns them crazy red and poof they are plump!!! This gloss literally lasts me about 2 hours which I think is good because every lipgloss I get expensive or drugstore I have to re apply a lot.</li>
            <li> According to a doctor on the Dr.Oz Show this is the closes to having cologen injections to plump up your lips.  Not true I saw zero difference.  Your lips burn some what because of the capsium in the gel but no plumping.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a long-term lip plumper, like LipFusion XL, so I just use it in the morning. It does burn, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty used to it now, and I find myself rather liking the tingle. I think the most dramatic swelling happens in the first half-hour or so, and after that my lips settle down into a plumped-but-not-crazy look. You do have to be careful with your SO when using this. Sometimes I like to mess with my husband, giving him a big old kiss right after I put this on and giggling at his duck lips for the next half-hour. So, very hilarious but use this power with caution so that you don&#x27;t get in trouble. :-P Once it stops being sticky, after 5 minutes or so, the risk of plumpy-transfer subsides and you can go about your business, so just watch out for those first few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll put this on first thing after washing my face, and by the time I&#x27;m done with the rest of my moisturizing/eye makeup/foundation process, my lips are ready to put gloss or lipstick on.</li>
            <li> i did received it .........</li>
            <li> I do not want any more Two faced products or any further charges. Thank you. Brenda Lindes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything, expensive, goes away in minutes and drys your lips out very badly. Buxom lip gloss is so much better which also helps prevent cold sores too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work like other lip plumpers I&#x27;ve gotten in the past and it made my mouth breakout in a rash.  Hubby and I got a good laugh over it - but never used it again (for obvious reasons)... FYI - The rash disappeared after a few hours.</li>
            <li> i didnt even get the product. i got the box with absolutely nothing in it. never ever ever ever ever again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I will buy again when I run out! I have tried lots of products like this and only this one works wonders!</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much to my lips , it just irritated them .&lt;br /&gt;All it does is swell up your lips .&lt;br /&gt;3 stars .</li>
            <li> I already have full lips, this does give a slightly &#x27;plumper&#x27; appearance but I think if your lips are thin it would not be a disappointment as the difference is so slight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It starts working almost immediately and has a nice, subtle aroma. You only need a very little bit in order for it to work, so this should last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive skin in the least, and I could feel a slightly uncomfortable tingling for a short time while using the product. I can imagine that people with sensitive skin (especially on the lips) would experience a bit more during use. While the sensation is normal, if you have sensitive skin you might want to make a test before actually using it.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was speedy, and tracking was constantly available. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Lip Injection works great on my lips. It&#x27;s sticky like every other gloss in the world, but about 2 or 3 minutes after applying it this natural just-bit-my-lip red shade has taken over my lips, which I just love. Makes my mouth really stand out while still looking like I&#x27;m just wearing clear gloss (since I definitely prefer the no makeup look). Burns for a minute or so, but my results were worth it.</li>
            <li> This item does what it says, i.e., plumps your lips, but unfortunately the brush that is used to apply it is of such poor quality that every time I use it, more and more of the brush strands come off and get stuck on my lips . . . not a fun task to remove them:-(  For the price, I would have hoped that the manufacturer could have come up with a better brush.</li>
            <li> This product arrived packaged perfect, and it really works, it has a peppermint taste to it with some spice, it does plump the lips, i love this product and plan to keep it on hand ..[[ASIN:B0002QNMUW Too Faced Cosmetics Lip Injection, 0.16 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This product feels gooey and sticky on my lips, It&#x27;s very glossy, but doesn&#x27;t plump much at all. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Have realistic expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, love this product will be buying again. Also use with caution if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The lip injection is a waste of money. It does not work like promised to plump your lips, it only tingles a bit and gives you shine, but that&#x27;s it. by the 2nd day of use it did not even tingle my lips and saw no plumping or fullness. DISAPOINTING!</li>
            <li> I would buy this again. Actually my sister liked it so much she had me order one for her. The reviews depend on what you are expecting. My lips are not on the very thin side, but I don&#x27;t have full lips either, I just have regular lips. I can see a difference with this product, but my aunt who has natural fuller lips thought my lips were exactly the same. I think she was expecting me to look like she naturally is (sometimes people like that tend to put you down). I was shocked to see the low reviews on this product. Anyway, you need to find it cheap and try it out yourself. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> I have bought and tried every lip plumper! I don&#x27;t know why I resisted buying this one for so long, probably because the reviews weren&#x27;t that great, but this is the strongest. The results only last about 2 hours so you need to keep applying but it really works. All other lip plumpers I have used don&#x27;t cause this swollen look to my lips. I get 1 syringe juvederm done every six months and when I put this product on it remind me of the way my lips look especially plump and pink after. I have always had lips on the medium to large side which may be why this product works for me. For my friend who tried it with small lips, not much happened.</li>
            <li> I did not experience much lip plumping, but it did make my lips a really pretty red color for about 20 minutes. There is a slight tingling sensation, but if you have used a lip plumper before you know this is normal. It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It makes your lips really soft and its a pretty lipgloss, but it didn&#x27;t do as much plumping as I expected. I am tan and it is a perfect color for my skin tone for an every day look.</li>
            <li> This does very little and has no color.. WASTE of money. If you want something that does a little just like this but actually has a color payoff buy Nyx lip plumping gloss. It costs maybe $3 dollars and does the same thing but actually is a great color payoff..  Shows just cause it costs more doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better...</li>
            <li> Slight tingling when you put it on but oh yes,  fuller lips. I don&#x27;t need lip gloss since it glossy!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It reacts with your lip to enhance a natural flushed colour and fuller look - gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;With a sweet, candy-like smell, this lip gloss is deicious to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Great value!</li>
