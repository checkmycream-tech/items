            <li>My husband and doula was so proud!</li>

            <li>Worked Great!  </li>
            <li>Loved it!!!  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an answer to a beautiful birth, here it is!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>discomfort&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent way to keep yourself from panicking during the birth process too, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality and follow up from the company too.  </li>
            <li>I feel those venues are promoting the best case scenarios.  </li>
            <li>I loved this!!  </li>
            <li>We had a very successful home birth.  </li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s birth was ideal for me</li>
            <li>Both births were painless, wonderful, and I felt so good afterward.</li>
            <li>She has a great voice for helping you to relax.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to learn all I need to know so on that wonderful day, I WILL HAVE A AMAZING BIRTH!!</li>
            <li>I would have not been able to have my ideal birth without it!</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was successful for me.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I just gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy and used Hypnobabies throughout my pregnancy to prepare for the baby&#x27;s birth.</li>
            <li>Though one of the suggestions did help me concentrate which was having your partner help, and I was able to talk and not scream this time around, ha ha!</li>
            <li>I love this course!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to have a spectacular birthing day!</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone who is willing to put forth the work to make it happen and to experience the way God intended for you to birth!!!!</li>
            <li>lord knows the tracks are certainly relaxing and the information is great!</li>
            <li>because I know what an amazing birth experience it gives to Moms and their babies.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful, it teaches you how to relax and make the birth of your babie so much easier.</li>
            <li>is kind of strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are relaxation exercises that were nice.</li>
            <li>I liked that I was able to do it on my own.</li>
            <li>If you would like to know more about my experience please contact me, I love to talk about it!</li>
            <li>It was a great first birthing experience!</li>
            <li>It is stated that even if we doze off, we would still be able to absorb the courses on a sublimal level.</li>
            <li>However, one suggestion I can give to the creators of the product is better label the cds:</li>
            <li>For those who requires a more comprehensive exercise program, it may be better to get a book or video specialising in this area.     </li>
            <li>In my case, I probably would have received more benefit from the Bradley or Lamaze method.</li>
            <li>One reviewer noted that the typography was distracting because too many things were bolded and in all caps- I am</li>
            <li>glad I ordered it anyway- not a problem.</li>
            <li>better sleep-</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will post updates as I experience more of this course.</li>
            <li>I love how they include letters that you can post on your hospital room door to let the hospital staff know your expectations of your birth.</li>
            <li>I make sure</li>
            <li>I have yet to see a more thorough program.</li>
            <li>The hypnobabies course helped a lot with being more relaxed and letting nature take</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off getting a doula.</li>
            <li>Obviously not what I&#x27;d wanted, but I made the best of my situation.  </li>
            <li>but I stayed focused and on top of the pain.  </li>
            <li>So after reading many reviews (from feeling no pain whatsoever to having it not work at all), I decided to purchase the program and use it.</li>
            <li>I felt it helped me stay focused and relaxed and able to reduce the pain.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted to come on here to write a review as someone who has used this program for 3 of 4 births.  </li>
            <li>I listened to my CDs and &amp;#34;slept&amp;#34; through most of the labor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t discourage you from buying this program, but I do discourage you from thinking it a sure bet for a painless birth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many women have used it three or more times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chose to use hypnobabies as my birth class.</li>
            <li>I think I was meant to approach my birthing as more of an athletic event rather than a relaxing meditative experience.</li>
            <li>Very powerful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth doing naturally but be prepared as best as you can!</li>
            <li>Meditation and relaxation are at the core of Hypnobabies, and those make a great foundation for a natural birth experience.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I really enjoyed using the guided meditations and benefited from feeling empowered to give birth comfortably and without medication.    </li>
            <li>I had a pain free birth that was more than I could have dreamed for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen great reviews, so I can&#x27;t wait to put this product in action.</li>
            <li>My clients who have done Hypnobabies have all had wonderful births themselves, peaceful and completely comfort.    </li>
            <li>The Hypnobabies Home Study Course helped me with being confident about my labor and delivery, which I felt was so important.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it! :)</li>
            <li>It was easy to follow.</li>
            <li>and in fact, I thought I remembered the author addressing this in the study guide--that even though some women do not experience a pain free birthing, many women have shorter labors and are overall happy with their birth experience after using the program.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the easy, comfortable birth Hypnobabies promises.</li>
            <li>will prevent you from internalizing the message that it will be pain free.  </li>
            <li>I think the techniques once again helped at that point to keep me calm and stay on top of my breathing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a better gift to your baby than being able to bring it into the world gently and joyfully without any drugs in their system.</li>
            <li>This really gave me the reassurance I needed to be able to confidently try.</li>
            <li>I was able to labor at home much longer than I ever would have without it; having learned how to relax through contractions made them so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I was able to have unmedicated, calm and peaceful births!!</li>
            <li>My first Hypnobaby was a surprise unattended homebirth, it was that easy!</li>
            <li>We also bought a la bassine birth tub (which was a major help!), the warm water was a Godsend too, I also had a much better diet this time around</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t practice as much as they suggest but feel I did pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Super easy recovery.</li>
            <li>However, it is very easy to use, explained very well.</li>
            <li>Third, there is a bounty of information on staying healthy and optimizing your chances of having an easier, shorter birthing by using diet, exercise and even physics (interesting that we forget that physics applies even in utero)!</li>
            <li>tried to copy Leclaire method which is original method.</li>
            <li>saving grace is that the CDs are helpful in developing a more positive frame of mind about pregnancy and birth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure in part because of the positive state of mind this material encourages.</li>
            <li>Everyone births differently, so this program may be great for some, depending on if you respond right to the verbal cues.</li>
            <li>I think the program skills are pretty great - I&#x27;d advise you to skip reading the blog and following the facebook page though.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this program did not prepare me for the intense and life-changing sensations of meaningful pain that I experienced birthing my first child (I didn&#x27;t use it for my 2nd child, if that says anything).  </li>
            <li>This time I had 2 full nights of pressure waves that would die off during the day.  </li>
            <li>I loved doing my Hypnobabies tracks while pregnant and actually miss it a lot now that my baby is here.  </li>
            <li>Though there is a section on exercise for pregnant women, it&#x27;s not too comprehensive and there are no pictures illustration for the exercise suggested.</li>
            <li>There was a tremendous amount of pain during my quick birth.</li>
            <li>I recommend and continue to recommend this program to everyone that I know is pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant again and will not be using hypnobabies this time.</li>
            <li>The idea stuck with me, and when I became pregnant I searched out information about a hypnosis for childbirth class.</li>
            <li>me, the program helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I went into labor on my own 10 days after my due date, and I&#x27;m glad I waited.</li>
            <li>I went into labor on my own 10 days after my due date, and I&#x27;m glad I waited.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s true; my labor certainly wasn&#x27;t pain free, though it was tolerable, and I did seek out additional information.  </li>
            <li>I have several more discs to go, but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was in my zone thanks to Hypnobabies!!</li>
            <li>She was so calm and focused during her labor, and felt joyous about her birth.</li>
            <li>I felt so sure that I would be able to relax and allow my body to work naturally, and I tried everything the program suggests to help me do that, but it was all completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t have been so completely unprepared for the pain and the pushing, but I was so confident from immersing myself in the hypnobabies program that I sort of felt like</li>
            <li>Worth it, could be cheaper though.  </li>
            <li>I agree with others that it was not the most professional presentation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to help manage through a natural birth, certainly better than doing nothing.</li>
            <li>This was my experience, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is a large time commitment to do the practices and CDs but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this 4 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>I would have a quick labor with minimal pain that I would be able to easily manage.</li>
            <li>and I abandoned it pretty quickly during labor.</li>
            <li>However, the verbal cues that the CD&#x27;s use aren&#x27;t right for me, but that is just me.</li>
            <li>I also found the workbook to be, for the most part, simply repeating information that is available elsewhere in more logical, complete and professionally presented format - i.e. Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, the Sears Birth Book, Gentle Birth Choices, etc.  </li>
            <li>My third birth was very easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think HypnoBabies is a great tool to use for childbirth, and I highly recommend it, just not to the exclusion of other knowledge.</li>
            <li>I was supremely confident in the program, and felt that everything would go smoothly and easily as long as I studied, thought positively, and believed in myself and &amp;quot;mind over matter&amp;quot; as the program teaches.</li>
            <li>I used HB during my birthing time and although the birthing waves were intense, everything happened so quickly.</li>
            <li>Now, my birth was uncomfortable and sometimes I found I couldn&#x27;t use the cues like I wanted to to just relax, but I still think it is a great product because it helped me to overcome my fear and confidently approach childbirth.</li>
            <li>I completed the first lesson (reading and disc tracks)- Week 1.</li>
            <li>The approach is logical, practical, and doesn&#x27;t insult your intelligence.</li>
            <li>My birthing day was so fast!</li>
            <li>My first son took 6 hours, not including the birthing waves I had at home.</li>
            <li>I was able to take a nap during labor and save up energy that got me through the last two hours.</li>
            <li>Had I used a more compatible midwife and/or used a doula, like I did with my second birth</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what HypnoBabies claimed it would be.</li>
            <li>First of all, I should acknowledge that HypnoBabies helped me get through 36 hours of pitocin-induced contractions with no pain medication.  </li>
            <li>That might be enough to qualify it for a five-star review for many, but not from me.  </li>
            <li>Since this was my second baby, I had made sure to cover all my bases and did more than rely on HB CD&#x27;s as the only way to alleviate the birthing waves.</li>
            <li>(I read the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon), I took magnesium and made sure to have herbs to take - red raspberry leaf tea and lady&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Overall I am glad I used it</li>
            <li>I first heard about hypnosis for childbirth on a Dateline NBC story YEARS before I ever thought of even having children.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>Not completely pain free, but I was relatively comfortable all the way up to transition.  </li>
            <li>Hypnobabies really does help me relax!</li>
            <li>Hypnobabies was recommended to us for our first birth.  </li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials arrived pretty quickly- a day earlier than expected- nice!</li>
            <li>From my point of view, it&#x27;s better to acknowledge and understand the interventions and medical procedures that might happen than to pretend positive thinking can protect you from anything negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this is so low key.&amp;#34;  I was smiling in between contractions, listening to my music and enjoyed my birth so much.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading the positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li>I became highly motivated to find a better way to birth when expecting my third.</li>
            <li>Transition was tolerable, and second stage was very quick.  </li>
            <li>Really helped me stay positive during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>So far I am really getting into this!!</li>
            <li>As other reviews state, the speakers voice is very soothing and pleasant to listen to, and I do occasionally doze off while listening to the cds.</li>
            <li>When i opened the package, I was really lost as there are</li>
            <li>I have to read through the whole course book and</li>
            <li>My labor was not pain free but was entirely manageable and I went from 4cm-baby in 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why they charge so much.</li>
            <li>This program is an absolute God Send.</li>
            <li>There is no need to take another class, thus introducing the very fear of birth you&#x27;re working to eliminate.</li>
            <li>(after that time I was just ready to have the baby and didn&#x27;t feel the need to continue practicing.</li>
            <li>If I had gone into it expecting a pain-free birth, I would have rated it much lower.</li>
            <li>My births were all hospital births, but thanks to Hypobabies</li>
            <li>Using the CDs to practice was VERY relaxing and helped with my confidence a lot.  </li>
            <li>During transition they made me walk the whole time to keep things moving and none of the techniques helped at all.  </li>
            <li>I stayed at home, in my recliner, with light snacks and water next to me and just listened to the scripts and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Too much information.</li>
            <li>Much easier</li>
            <li>I am very conflicted about how to rate this program.  </li>
            <li>Maybe nothing can prepare you for the pushing part, but I felt very unprepared for it.</li>
            <li>I do think my hypnosis skills were useful in the third birth, but it was not the kind of experience I had expected or hoped for.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I had a hard time entering hypnosis during my practice sessions, but the tracks were great for general relaxation and helping to fall asleep at night!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a complete childbirth program.</li>
            <li>Since this was my first child, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and my plan was to have a natural childbirth with a midwife at home (and I did).</li>
            <li>I refused to be induced until I was 42 weeks, which is what the ACOG (American College of OB/GYN&#x27;s) states is actually full term.</li>
            <li>I refused to be induced until I was 42 weeks, which is what the ACOG (American College of OB/GYN&#x27;s) states is actually full term.</li>
            <li>I tried Hypnobabies to prepare for having a natural birth with my first child.</li>
            <li>Born-Again Christian, carrying my first child (as of today 30 wks), age 37, married, college educated, highly analytical, very low-key, and a research geek.</li>
            <li>Good thing that part only lasts a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s realistic capabilities.  </li>
            <li>I think the package would also greatly benefit from the addition of at least one postpartum CD, since going from week after week of daily hypnosis to nothing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not knocking the experiences of women who were successful with it, but for me, it was pretty much useless during labor.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to any mama-to-be.</li>
            <li>He was 8 lb, 4 oz, so large, but not a reason to have induced me early.</li>
            <li>He was 8 lb, 4 oz, so large, but not a reason to have induced me early.</li>
            <li>Maybe this can help you judge who this is coming from a little better.</li>
            <li>There seemed little point to risking a birth on some freeway when we could do it safely at home.</li>
            <li>I took a small dose of Stadol at that point and after it wore off, I had a very quick and easy second stage.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review whether it works now as I&#x27;m still only 5 months pregnant,but the practice of bubble of peace/protection affirmations helps to calm my mind and mood at times.    </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to consider a natural birth.</li>
            <li>I fully credit hypnobabies with my ability to stay calm through all of the insanity that was that day, and the following weeks in the hospital.</li>
            <li>Really helped with my natural birth</li>
            <li>It really helps to decrease my anxiety and clear any fears that might exacerbate sensations of pain.</li>
            <li>My natural birth nearly pain free and only 2 hours.</li>
            <li>There are several keys to the success of Hypnobabies.</li>
            <li>I used to laugh at this sort of thing but had an open mind this time.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd night was pretty intense</li>
            <li>and I think it helped a lot but certainly not pain free.  </li>
            <li>Second stage was quick, but I was pretty shell shocked from the amount of pain I experienced.  </li>
            <li>It was not calm and not pain free.</li>
            <li>I had such a peaceful pregnancy this time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, having had a high-risk pregnancy, I disliked the stigma HypnoBabies put on becoming high-risk.  </li>
            <li>The last birth, the Hypnobabies tracks really helped me to stay so relaxed that I almost didn&#x27;t make it to the hospital in time,, dilating from 4-8 in an hour while at hime!</li>
            <li>naturally then PLEASE get Hypnobabies!</li>
            <li>My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE skeptic of things like this, but after reading the previous reviews I thought I would give this a</li>
            <li>I studyed this program very carefully while working full time and taking care of a pre-schooler.</li>
            <li>I want information presented clearly and in an unbiased manner.  </li>
            <li>I am a doula, and one of my clients used the Hypnobabies Home Study Course for Expectant Mothers to achieve the natural VBAC birth she desired.  </li>
            <li>Well-packaged and organized- professional looking kit.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t leave a review about how it works as far as during birth.</li>
            <li>Having given birth naturally a couple of times now, I feel like I know my body</li>
            <li>Birth is a natural process but it often involves work and pain.  </li>
            <li>It worked during the early stages of labor</li>
            <li>as I said, I worked my tail off preparing for a natural birth.</li>
            <li>But, my hope was simply a natural childbirth experience where I could relax and let my body do what it needed to do.</li>
            <li>Early labor just felt like pressure.</li>
            <li>baby\\&quot; is a reason they gave me to want to induce early, and I was told my baby would be well over 10 lbs.</li>
            <li>baby\\&quot; is a reason they gave me to want to induce early, and I was told my baby would be well over 10 lbs.</li>
            <li>When it wore off and I was nearly dilated, I resorted to screaming.  </li>
            <li>Every set of circumstances is different, and no one should feel that this program is promising them something it cannot promise.  </li>
            <li>I did not buy in completely, or play the cd&#x27;s on the day of my birth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you want a natural birth!!!</li>
            <li>I have in the mean time recommended it to many of my friends who had fears or anxiety about birthing.  </li>
            <li>This program really did work for me, but it was not completely painless as others have said it was for them.</li>
            <li>This program really did work for me, but it was not completely painless as others have said it was for them.</li>
            <li>I would have stated that my first two births were &amp;#34;nearly painless&amp;#34; but certainly not &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I had a natural hospital birth with my second 9+ lb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost if you have time to practice... if you don&#x27;t have time it&#x27;ll be a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I did some major research for my fourth baby.  </li>
            <li>We used the program for our first baby and had misplaced the home study set.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, because of where I live (central valley, CA), there was only Lamaze available.</li>
            <li>By the time I was ready to go to the hospital, what I felt was more like bad menstrual</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> discomfort&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent way to keep yourself from panicking during the birth process too, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality and follow up from the company too.  </li>
            <li> I feel those venues are promoting the best case scenarios.  </li>
            <li> I loved this!!  </li>
            <li> We had a very successful home birth.  </li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s birth was ideal for me</li>
            <li> Both births were painless, wonderful, and I felt so good afterward.</li>
            <li> She has a great voice for helping you to relax.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to learn all I need to know so on that wonderful day, I WILL HAVE A AMAZING BIRTH!!</li>
            <li> I would have not been able to have my ideal birth without it!</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was successful for me.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I just gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy and used Hypnobabies throughout my pregnancy to prepare for the baby&#x27;s birth.</li>
            <li> Though one of the suggestions did help me concentrate which was having your partner help, and I was able to talk and not scream this time around, ha ha!</li>
            <li> I love this course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to have a spectacular birthing day!</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone who is willing to put forth the work to make it happen and to experience the way God intended for you to birth!!!!</li>
            <li> lord knows the tracks are certainly relaxing and the information is great!</li>
            <li> because I know what an amazing birth experience it gives to Moms and their babies.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful, it teaches you how to relax and make the birth of your babie so much easier.</li>
            <li> is kind of strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are relaxation exercises that were nice.</li>
            <li> I liked that I was able to do it on my own.</li>
            <li> If you would like to know more about my experience please contact me, I love to talk about it!</li>
            <li> It was a great first birthing experience!</li>
            <li> It is stated that even if we doze off, we would still be able to absorb the courses on a sublimal level.</li>
            <li> However, one suggestion I can give to the creators of the product is better label the cds:</li>
            <li> For those who requires a more comprehensive exercise program, it may be better to get a book or video specialising in this area.     </li>
            <li> In my case, I probably would have received more benefit from the Bradley or Lamaze method.</li>
            <li> One reviewer noted that the typography was distracting because too many things were bolded and in all caps- I am</li>
            <li> glad I ordered it anyway- not a problem.</li>
            <li> better sleep-</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will post updates as I experience more of this course.</li>
            <li> I love how they include letters that you can post on your hospital room door to let the hospital staff know your expectations of your birth.</li>
            <li> I make sure</li>
            <li> I have yet to see a more thorough program.</li>
            <li> The hypnobabies course helped a lot with being more relaxed and letting nature take</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off getting a doula.</li>
            <li> Obviously not what I&#x27;d wanted, but I made the best of my situation.  </li>
            <li> but I stayed focused and on top of the pain.  </li>
            <li> So after reading many reviews (from feeling no pain whatsoever to having it not work at all), I decided to purchase the program and use it.</li>
            <li> I felt it helped me stay focused and relaxed and able to reduce the pain.</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted to come on here to write a review as someone who has used this program for 3 of 4 births.  </li>
            <li> I listened to my CDs and &amp;#34;slept&amp;#34; through most of the labor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t discourage you from buying this program, but I do discourage you from thinking it a sure bet for a painless birth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many women have used it three or more times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I chose to use hypnobabies as my birth class.</li>
            <li> I think I was meant to approach my birthing as more of an athletic event rather than a relaxing meditative experience.</li>
            <li> Very powerful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth doing naturally but be prepared as best as you can!</li>
            <li> Meditation and relaxation are at the core of Hypnobabies, and those make a great foundation for a natural birth experience.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I really enjoyed using the guided meditations and benefited from feeling empowered to give birth comfortably and without medication.    </li>
            <li> I had a pain free birth that was more than I could have dreamed for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great reviews, so I can&#x27;t wait to put this product in action.</li>
            <li> My clients who have done Hypnobabies have all had wonderful births themselves, peaceful and completely comfort.    </li>
            <li> The Hypnobabies Home Study Course helped me with being confident about my labor and delivery, which I felt was so important.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it! :)</li>
            <li> It was easy to follow.</li>
            <li> and in fact, I thought I remembered the author addressing this in the study guide--that even though some women do not experience a pain free birthing, many women have shorter labors and are overall happy with their birth experience after using the program.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the easy, comfortable birth Hypnobabies promises.</li>
            <li> will prevent you from internalizing the message that it will be pain free.  </li>
            <li> I think the techniques once again helped at that point to keep me calm and stay on top of my breathing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a better gift to your baby than being able to bring it into the world gently and joyfully without any drugs in their system.</li>
            <li> This really gave me the reassurance I needed to be able to confidently try.</li>
            <li> I was able to labor at home much longer than I ever would have without it; having learned how to relax through contractions made them so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I was able to have unmedicated, calm and peaceful births!!</li>
            <li> My first Hypnobaby was a surprise unattended homebirth, it was that easy!</li>
            <li> We also bought a la bassine birth tub (which was a major help!), the warm water was a Godsend too, I also had a much better diet this time around</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t practice as much as they suggest but feel I did pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Super easy recovery.</li>
            <li> However, it is very easy to use, explained very well.</li>
            <li> Third, there is a bounty of information on staying healthy and optimizing your chances of having an easier, shorter birthing by using diet, exercise and even physics (interesting that we forget that physics applies even in utero)!</li>
            <li> tried to copy Leclaire method which is original method.</li>
            <li> saving grace is that the CDs are helpful in developing a more positive frame of mind about pregnancy and birth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure in part because of the positive state of mind this material encourages.</li>
            <li> Everyone births differently, so this program may be great for some, depending on if you respond right to the verbal cues.</li>
            <li> I think the program skills are pretty great - I&#x27;d advise you to skip reading the blog and following the facebook page though.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this program did not prepare me for the intense and life-changing sensations of meaningful pain that I experienced birthing my first child (I didn&#x27;t use it for my 2nd child, if that says anything).  </li>
            <li> This time I had 2 full nights of pressure waves that would die off during the day.  </li>
            <li> I loved doing my Hypnobabies tracks while pregnant and actually miss it a lot now that my baby is here.  </li>
            <li> Though there is a section on exercise for pregnant women, it&#x27;s not too comprehensive and there are no pictures illustration for the exercise suggested.</li>
            <li> There was a tremendous amount of pain during my quick birth.</li>
            <li> I recommend and continue to recommend this program to everyone that I know is pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant again and will not be using hypnobabies this time.</li>
            <li> The idea stuck with me, and when I became pregnant I searched out information about a hypnosis for childbirth class.</li>
            <li> me, the program helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I went into labor on my own 10 days after my due date, and I&#x27;m glad I waited.</li>
            <li> I went into labor on my own 10 days after my due date, and I&#x27;m glad I waited.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s true; my labor certainly wasn&#x27;t pain free, though it was tolerable, and I did seek out additional information.  </li>
            <li> I have several more discs to go, but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was in my zone thanks to Hypnobabies!!</li>
            <li> She was so calm and focused during her labor, and felt joyous about her birth.</li>
            <li> I felt so sure that I would be able to relax and allow my body to work naturally, and I tried everything the program suggests to help me do that, but it was all completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t have been so completely unprepared for the pain and the pushing, but I was so confident from immersing myself in the hypnobabies program that I sort of felt like</li>
            <li> Worth it, could be cheaper though.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that it was not the most professional presentation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to help manage through a natural birth, certainly better than doing nothing.</li>
            <li> This was my experience, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is a large time commitment to do the practices and CDs but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this 4 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li> I would have a quick labor with minimal pain that I would be able to easily manage.</li>
            <li> and I abandoned it pretty quickly during labor.</li>
            <li> However, the verbal cues that the CD&#x27;s use aren&#x27;t right for me, but that is just me.</li>
            <li> I also found the workbook to be, for the most part, simply repeating information that is available elsewhere in more logical, complete and professionally presented format - i.e. Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, the Sears Birth Book, Gentle Birth Choices, etc.  </li>
            <li> My third birth was very easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think HypnoBabies is a great tool to use for childbirth, and I highly recommend it, just not to the exclusion of other knowledge.</li>
            <li> I was supremely confident in the program, and felt that everything would go smoothly and easily as long as I studied, thought positively, and believed in myself and &amp;quot;mind over matter&amp;quot; as the program teaches.</li>
            <li> I used HB during my birthing time and although the birthing waves were intense, everything happened so quickly.</li>
            <li> Now, my birth was uncomfortable and sometimes I found I couldn&#x27;t use the cues like I wanted to to just relax, but I still think it is a great product because it helped me to overcome my fear and confidently approach childbirth.</li>
            <li> I completed the first lesson (reading and disc tracks)- Week 1.</li>
            <li> The approach is logical, practical, and doesn&#x27;t insult your intelligence.</li>
            <li> My birthing day was so fast!</li>
            <li> My first son took 6 hours, not including the birthing waves I had at home.</li>
            <li> I was able to take a nap during labor and save up energy that got me through the last two hours.</li>
            <li> Had I used a more compatible midwife and/or used a doula, like I did with my second birth</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what HypnoBabies claimed it would be.</li>
            <li> First of all, I should acknowledge that HypnoBabies helped me get through 36 hours of pitocin-induced contractions with no pain medication.  </li>
            <li> That might be enough to qualify it for a five-star review for many, but not from me.  </li>
            <li> Since this was my second baby, I had made sure to cover all my bases and did more than rely on HB CD&#x27;s as the only way to alleviate the birthing waves.</li>
            <li> (I read the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon), I took magnesium and made sure to have herbs to take - red raspberry leaf tea and lady&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Overall I am glad I used it</li>
            <li> I first heard about hypnosis for childbirth on a Dateline NBC story YEARS before I ever thought of even having children.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> Not completely pain free, but I was relatively comfortable all the way up to transition.  </li>
            <li> Hypnobabies really does help me relax!</li>
            <li> Hypnobabies was recommended to us for our first birth.  </li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials arrived pretty quickly- a day earlier than expected- nice!</li>
            <li> From my point of view, it&#x27;s better to acknowledge and understand the interventions and medical procedures that might happen than to pretend positive thinking can protect you from anything negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is so low key.&amp;#34;  I was smiling in between contractions, listening to my music and enjoyed my birth so much.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I became highly motivated to find a better way to birth when expecting my third.</li>
            <li> Transition was tolerable, and second stage was very quick.  </li>
            <li> Really helped me stay positive during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> So far I am really getting into this!!</li>
            <li> As other reviews state, the speakers voice is very soothing and pleasant to listen to, and I do occasionally doze off while listening to the cds.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package, I was really lost as there are</li>
            <li> I have to read through the whole course book and</li>
            <li> My labor was not pain free but was entirely manageable and I went from 4cm-baby in 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why they charge so much.</li>
            <li> This program is an absolute God Send.</li>
            <li> There is no need to take another class, thus introducing the very fear of birth you&#x27;re working to eliminate.</li>
            <li> (after that time I was just ready to have the baby and didn&#x27;t feel the need to continue practicing.</li>
            <li> If I had gone into it expecting a pain-free birth, I would have rated it much lower.</li>
            <li> My births were all hospital births, but thanks to Hypobabies</li>
            <li> Using the CDs to practice was VERY relaxing and helped with my confidence a lot.  </li>
            <li> During transition they made me walk the whole time to keep things moving and none of the techniques helped at all.  </li>
            <li> I stayed at home, in my recliner, with light snacks and water next to me and just listened to the scripts and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Too much information.</li>
            <li> Much easier</li>
            <li> I am very conflicted about how to rate this program.  </li>
            <li> Maybe nothing can prepare you for the pushing part, but I felt very unprepared for it.</li>
            <li> I do think my hypnosis skills were useful in the third birth, but it was not the kind of experience I had expected or hoped for.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time entering hypnosis during my practice sessions, but the tracks were great for general relaxation and helping to fall asleep at night!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a complete childbirth program.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first child, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and my plan was to have a natural childbirth with a midwife at home (and I did).</li>
            <li> I refused to be induced until I was 42 weeks, which is what the ACOG (American College of OB/GYN&#x27;s) states is actually full term.</li>
            <li> I refused to be induced until I was 42 weeks, which is what the ACOG (American College of OB/GYN&#x27;s) states is actually full term.</li>
            <li> I tried Hypnobabies to prepare for having a natural birth with my first child.</li>
            <li> Born-Again Christian, carrying my first child (as of today 30 wks), age 37, married, college educated, highly analytical, very low-key, and a research geek.</li>
            <li> Good thing that part only lasts a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s realistic capabilities.  </li>
            <li> I think the package would also greatly benefit from the addition of at least one postpartum CD, since going from week after week of daily hypnosis to nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking the experiences of women who were successful with it, but for me, it was pretty much useless during labor.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to any mama-to-be.</li>
            <li> He was 8 lb, 4 oz, so large, but not a reason to have induced me early.</li>
            <li> He was 8 lb, 4 oz, so large, but not a reason to have induced me early.</li>
            <li> Maybe this can help you judge who this is coming from a little better.</li>
            <li> There seemed little point to risking a birth on some freeway when we could do it safely at home.</li>
            <li> I took a small dose of Stadol at that point and after it wore off, I had a very quick and easy second stage.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review whether it works now as I&#x27;m still only 5 months pregnant,but the practice of bubble of peace/protection affirmations helps to calm my mind and mood at times.    </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to consider a natural birth.</li>
            <li> I fully credit hypnobabies with my ability to stay calm through all of the insanity that was that day, and the following weeks in the hospital.</li>
            <li> Really helped with my natural birth</li>
            <li> It really helps to decrease my anxiety and clear any fears that might exacerbate sensations of pain.</li>
            <li> My natural birth nearly pain free and only 2 hours.</li>
            <li> There are several keys to the success of Hypnobabies.</li>
            <li> I used to laugh at this sort of thing but had an open mind this time.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd night was pretty intense</li>
            <li> and I think it helped a lot but certainly not pain free.  </li>
            <li> Second stage was quick, but I was pretty shell shocked from the amount of pain I experienced.  </li>
            <li> It was not calm and not pain free.</li>
            <li> I had such a peaceful pregnancy this time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, having had a high-risk pregnancy, I disliked the stigma HypnoBabies put on becoming high-risk.  </li>
            <li> The last birth, the Hypnobabies tracks really helped me to stay so relaxed that I almost didn&#x27;t make it to the hospital in time,, dilating from 4-8 in an hour while at hime!</li>
            <li> naturally then PLEASE get Hypnobabies!</li>
            <li> My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE skeptic of things like this, but after reading the previous reviews I thought I would give this a</li>
            <li> I studyed this program very carefully while working full time and taking care of a pre-schooler.</li>
            <li> I want information presented clearly and in an unbiased manner.  </li>
            <li> I am a doula, and one of my clients used the Hypnobabies Home Study Course for Expectant Mothers to achieve the natural VBAC birth she desired.  </li>
            <li> Well-packaged and organized- professional looking kit.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t leave a review about how it works as far as during birth.</li>
            <li> Having given birth naturally a couple of times now, I feel like I know my body</li>
            <li> Birth is a natural process but it often involves work and pain.  </li>
            <li> It worked during the early stages of labor</li>
            <li> as I said, I worked my tail off preparing for a natural birth.</li>
            <li> But, my hope was simply a natural childbirth experience where I could relax and let my body do what it needed to do.</li>
            <li> Early labor just felt like pressure.</li>
            <li> baby\\&quot; is a reason they gave me to want to induce early, and I was told my baby would be well over 10 lbs.</li>
            <li> baby\\&quot; is a reason they gave me to want to induce early, and I was told my baby would be well over 10 lbs.</li>
            <li> When it wore off and I was nearly dilated, I resorted to screaming.  </li>
            <li> Every set of circumstances is different, and no one should feel that this program is promising them something it cannot promise.  </li>
            <li> I did not buy in completely, or play the cd&#x27;s on the day of my birth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you want a natural birth!!!</li>
            <li> I have in the mean time recommended it to many of my friends who had fears or anxiety about birthing.  </li>
            <li> This program really did work for me, but it was not completely painless as others have said it was for them.</li>
            <li> This program really did work for me, but it was not completely painless as others have said it was for them.</li>
            <li> I would have stated that my first two births were &amp;#34;nearly painless&amp;#34; but certainly not &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I had a natural hospital birth with my second 9+ lb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost if you have time to practice... if you don&#x27;t have time it&#x27;ll be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did some major research for my fourth baby.  </li>
            <li> We used the program for our first baby and had misplaced the home study set.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because of where I live (central valley, CA), there was only Lamaze available.</li>
            <li> By the time I was ready to go to the hospital, what I felt was more like bad menstrual</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was a bit cocky with the fourth birth, but I expected it to be similar to the first two hypnobabies births.  </li>
            <li> So, bottom-line: go ahead and use this program BUT get a doula or speak to other women who have given birth naturally.  </li>
            <li> I live less than 1 mile from the hospital, so I labored at home until my contractions (birth waves) were about 3 min apart, at the recommendation of my OB.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a repeat of my prior births, which were long, and excruciating.    </li>
            <li> I was so thrown-off guard by the late stage contractions that I allowed the midwife to rupture my membranes, which was most likely unnecessary, and ended up on a hospital bed in the traditional stirruped position with 4 different nurses yelling \\&quot;push\\&quot; in unison.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;HypnoBabies is NOT a thorough, comprehensive childbirth prep system, and it definitely claims to be, going so far as to recommend that you not attend any other classes or seek out any other information.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to put it into practice for delivery yet, but I have already gone through the entire class and use the hypno-anesthesia for other things, such as dentist visits!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was a bad thing to do, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it as 100 percent effective against &#x27;</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order this out of fear this was not a professionally produced kit-</li>
            <li> also should mention that I was not induced, even though they wanted to induce me on my due date, with no medical reason to do so.</li>
            <li> also should mention that I was not induced, even though they wanted to induce me on my due date, with no medical reason to do so.</li>
            <li> I think this really help us out when it came down to having our baby, my wife was very calm and remember alot of the techniques not too bad</li>
            <li> For women with pre-existing conditions (or just bad luck) a natural, low-intervention birth can still be possible, and is still a worthy goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m the first one to pick out poor quality).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have your typical hypnobabies experience,  but it definitely helped me with the experience I got.</li>
            <li> The birth was not even close to what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is due to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had workouts that were harder!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterward, I felt confused, resentful, and even guilty, sure that it must have been my fault</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the tracks during active labor for some reason-</li>
            <li> I was never very good at the staying in hypnosis with my eyes open thing.  </li>
            <li> I studied this whole program and would recommend to anyone, sadly we had a distressed delivery and had to have an emergency C-section</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I wish the &amp;#34;pushing baby out&amp;#34; track was longer.</li>
            <li> My son was born via emergency csection 5 weeks early, measuring 7 weeks behind, because of IUGR and placental problems.</li>
            <li> The sequence of topics covered was not logical, and it was a waste of my time to have to wade through pages and pages of underlined, italicized, bolded text in order to get the information that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I turned to Hypnobabies after two typical hospital births with an epidural.</li>
            <li> and I know that leading up to my delivery,  Hypnobabies helped me to prepare mentally--and for me, that was half the battle.</li>
            <li> I still use them even though I&#x27;m not pregnant anymore.</li>
            <li> A little about who this is coming from...</li>
            <li> and I had a 19 month old at home and worked which made 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each day almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> sometimes, i still have trouble matching the cd to which course lesson it applies to.       </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful for everyday</li>
            <li> mantle- a few months before giving birth.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The next day I was so mentally tired that they almost sent me for an epidural.  </li>
            <li> You need to have time everyday to practice/read the book 1 to 2 hours a day for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do believe inductions prior to 42 weeks, for no medical reason, can contribute to extended and painful labors, even c-sections.</li>
            <li> I do believe inductions prior to 42 weeks, for no medical reason, can contribute to extended and painful labors, even c-sections.</li>
            <li> My first birth (without hypnosis) was very long and very painful.  </li>
            <li> It certainly was not a birth to feel badly about.  </li>
            <li> I fully agree with other reviewers who have commented on the amateurish quality of the workbook.  </li>
            <li> However, when it came to the day of my birth, it was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> (I used to get up 2-3x and awaken at least 5x-</li>
            <li> some other reviewers, I was distracted by the poor editing of the written materials and the awkward wording on some of the CDs, but I managed to get past that.  </li>
            <li> But the rest of this expensive &#x27;home study&#x27; package is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but once things really started rolling, it was excruciatingly painful and none of the Hypnobabies tools or techniques helped me.</li>
            <li> eg to indicate the approximate week to listen to which cd.</li>
            <li> I had convinced myself the birth would not be painful due to my hypnosis.</li>
            <li> I now know that I did nothing wrong -</li>
            <li> I had horrible back labor</li>
            <li> I have even seen them list &amp;#34;statistics&amp;#34; about the results of their program that I am highly skeptical of.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to communicate to staff and my doula while listening to the tracks</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from a sinus infection with horrible sleep for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was not - I had about 6 hours of uncomfortable contractions, about 5 hours of painful contractions, and about 2-3 hours of begging for help from God.  </li>
            <li> we were very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Their assumption is that hearing childbirth will be painful</li>
            <li> I felt ready--plus, I was growing exhausted with the terrible writing style of the author and the way the book was put together.</li>
            <li> My contractions were painful and listening to hypnobabies through the contractions did not help.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> and it just felt to me like the worst menstrual cramps.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the positive reviews on it. As other reviews state, the speakers voice is very soothing and pleasant to listen to, and I do occasionally doze off while listening to the cds. It is stated that even if we doze off, we would still be able to absorb the courses on a sublimal level. I can&#x27;t review whether it works now as I&#x27;m still only 5 months pregnant,but the practice of bubble of peace/protection affirmations helps to calm my mind and mood at times.    However, one suggestion I can give to the creators of the product is better label the cds: eg to indicate the approximate week to listen to which cd. When i opened the package, I was really lost as there are a couple of individuals cds just slotted into the package, and I do not know which cd to play at which stage. I have to read through the whole course book and sometimes, i still have trouble matching the cd to which course lesson it applies to.       Another thing: Though there is a section on exercise for pregnant women, it&#x27;s not too comprehensive and there are no pictures illustration for the exercise suggested. For those who requires a more comprehensive exercise program, it may be better to get a book or video specialising in this area.     Overall, i would still rate 4 stars for this product. I can feel the creator&#x27;s passion for imparting the techniques of hypnobirth in the materials, and hopefully, i can achieve my birthing without the need of epidural or drugs.</li>
            <li> I followed the hypnobabies program as directed in the instructions. However, when it came to the day of my birth, it was not effective for me. There was a tremendous amount of pain during my quick birth. I did not even know what to do about the pain. I had convinced myself the birth would not be painful due to my hypnosis. The birth was not even close to what I expected it to be. It was not calm and not pain free. In my case, I probably would have received more benefit from the Bradley or Lamaze method.</li>
            <li> I am a doula, and one of my clients used the Hypnobabies Home Study Course for Expectant Mothers to achieve the natural VBAC birth she desired.  She was so calm and focused during her labor, and felt joyous about her birth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how it works lord knows the tracks are certainly relaxing and the information is great!</li>
            <li> I loved doing my Hypnobabies tracks while pregnant and actually miss it a lot now that my baby is here.  I had such a peaceful pregnancy this time and I believe it is due to this product.  My labor was not pain free but was entirely manageable and I went from 4cm-baby in 3 hours.  I didn&#x27;t use the tracks but I did try and found that just closing my eyes and using relaxation and the cues that I learned from my tracks while practicing is all I needed.  I recommend and continue to recommend this program to everyone that I know is pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE skeptic of things like this, but after reading the previous reviews I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials arrived pretty quickly- a day earlier than expected- nice! Well-packaged and organized- professional looking kit. One reviewer noted that the typography was distracting because too many things were bolded and in all caps- I am a graphic designer/art director- and this has not been a problem for me (I&#x27;m the first one to pick out poor quality). I almost didn&#x27;t order this out of fear this was not a professionally produced kit- glad I ordered it anyway- not a problem. Maybe they revamped the kit since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the disc content... I completed the first lesson (reading and disc tracks)- Week 1. It is not what I thought- which is a good thing. The approach is logical, practical, and doesn&#x27;t insult your intelligence. She has a great voice for helping you to relax. I have several more discs to go, but so far I am very pleased. I have been suffering from a sinus infection with horrible sleep for a few weeks. The nights that I listen to the tracks- I do get better sleep- (I used to get up 2-3x and awaken at least 5x- with the HypnoBabies disc 1, I get up 1-2x and don&#x27;t wake up otherwise.) I tend to fall asleep listening- which they say is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post updates as I experience more of this course. I rely on Amazon reviews and I hope that this review can be of help also. A little about who this is coming from... Born-Again Christian, carrying my first child (as of today 30 wks), age 37, married, college educated, highly analytical, very low-key, and a research geek. Maybe this can help you judge who this is coming from a little better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My wife loves it. It is wonderful, it teaches you how to relax and make the birth of your babie so much easier.</li>
            <li> So far I am really getting into this!! I just got it 2 days ago so I can&#x27;t leave a review about how it works as far as during birth. However, it is very easy to use, explained very well. There is a lot of reading involved, but if you are a hardcore reader like myself, this is nothing!! I love how they include letters that you can post on your hospital room door to let the hospital staff know your expectations of your birth. I am so excited to learn all I need to know so on that wonderful day, I WILL HAVE A AMAZING BIRTH!! I will update this review after baby is born (Guess date for baby&#x27;s arrival is July 11, 2012)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby is almost 5 months now. He was born on July 12th. My birthing day was so fast! I used HB during my birthing time and although the birthing waves were intense, everything happened so quickly. From 10:30 pm when my water broke out of no where, to 12:25 am when he arrived. Only 2 hours! I definitely credit that to Hypnobabies! My first son took 6 hours, not including the birthing waves I had at home. This time, from the beginning to end, only 2 hours! Get this product and use it as suggested!</li>
            <li> I wish I ordered this earlier in my pregnancy.  I was able to take a nap during labor and save up energy that got me through the last two hours.</li>
            <li> Having given birth naturally a couple of times now, I feel like I know my body and it&#x27;s realistic capabilities.  Meditation and relaxation are at the core of Hypnobabies, and those make a great foundation for a natural birth experience.  In fact, I really enjoyed using the guided meditations and benefited from feeling empowered to give birth comfortably and without medication.    That being said, this program did not prepare me for the intense and life-changing sensations of meaningful pain that I experienced birthing my first child (I didn&#x27;t use it for my 2nd child, if that says anything).  I was so thrown-off guard by the late stage contractions that I allowed the midwife to rupture my membranes, which was most likely unnecessary, and ended up on a hospital bed in the traditional stirruped position with 4 different nurses yelling \\&quot;push\\&quot; in unison.  Had I used a more compatible midwife and/or used a doula, like I did with my second birth, I wouldn&#x27;t have been so completely unprepared for the pain and the pushing, but I was so confident from immersing myself in the hypnobabies program that I sort of felt like, well, I was above everything.    So, bottom-line: go ahead and use this program BUT get a doula or speak to other women who have given birth naturally.  Do yoga and water aerobics.  Know that every woman&#x27;s birth experience is different.  Birth is a natural process but it often involves work and pain.  It&#x27;s totally worth doing naturally but be prepared as best as you can!</li>
            <li> The attending nurse at my unmedicated water birth said she became a believer in Hypnobabies. My husband and doula was so proud! This definitely helped me eliminate my birthing fears and replaced it with living in the present and taking control of my body and mind. It was a great first birthing experience!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what HypnoBabies claimed it would be. It is an awesome program and I would highly recommend it to any mama-to-be. We used the program for our first baby and had misplaced the home study set. When we could not find the study set, and it was time to start studying it for our second baby, we ordered the set again...it is that great!</li>
            <li> Worked Great!  I made it through two weeks at 4 cm dialated/90% effaced without incident.  It put me to sleep every time, but then, I WAS GETTING SLEEP!  Worth it, could be cheaper though.  I don&#x27;t see why they charge so much.</li>
            <li> First of all, I should acknowledge that HypnoBabies helped me get through 36 hours of pitocin-induced contractions with no pain medication.  That might be enough to qualify it for a five-star review for many, but not from me.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HypnoBabies is NOT a thorough, comprehensive childbirth prep system, and it definitely claims to be, going so far as to recommend that you not attend any other classes or seek out any other information.  Their assumption is that hearing childbirth will be painful will prevent you from internalizing the message that it will be pain free.  Maybe that&#x27;s true; my labor certainly wasn&#x27;t pain free, though it was tolerable, and I did seek out additional information.  Had I not, I wouldn&#x27;t have been prepared at all for the unforeseen \\&quot;bumps in the road\\&quot; that can happen during childbirth.  From my point of view, it&#x27;s better to acknowledge and understand the interventions and medical procedures that might happen than to pretend positive thinking can protect you from anything negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, having had a high-risk pregnancy, I disliked the stigma HypnoBabies put on becoming high-risk.  For women with pre-existing conditions (or just bad luck) a natural, low-intervention birth can still be possible, and is still a worthy goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other reviewers, I was distracted by the poor editing of the written materials and the awkward wording on some of the CDs, but I managed to get past that.  I think the package would also greatly benefit from the addition of at least one postpartum CD, since going from week after week of daily hypnosis to nothing is kind of strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think HypnoBabies is a great tool to use for childbirth, and I highly recommend it, just not to the exclusion of other knowledge.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!  If you are looking for an answer to a beautiful birth, here it is!  Very powerful!</li>
            <li> This program is an absolute God Send. I studyed this program very carefully while working full time and taking care of a pre-schooler. I birthed by myself with help from my doula and this program helped me to have control over myself and my body. I did not have ANY interventions at the hospital and my birthing was miraculous. If you would like to know more about my experience please contact me, I love to talk about it! I would suggest this to anyone who is willing to put forth the work to make it happen and to experience the way God intended for you to birth!!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Despite practicing and studying Hypnobabies religiously, it did not work for me. I&#x27;m not knocking the experiences of women who were successful with it, but for me, it was pretty much useless during labor. I was supremely confident in the program, and felt that everything would go smoothly and easily as long as I studied, thought positively, and believed in myself and &amp;quot;mind over matter&amp;quot; as the program teaches. It worked during the early stages of labor but once things really started rolling, it was excruciatingly painful and none of the Hypnobabies tools or techniques helped me. I felt so sure that I would be able to relax and allow my body to work naturally, and I tried everything the program suggests to help me do that, but it was all completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, I felt confused, resentful, and even guilty, sure that it must have been my fault I didn&#x27;t have the easy, comfortable birth Hypnobabies promises. I now know that I did nothing wrong - as I said, I worked my tail off preparing for a natural birth. For whatever reason, Hypnobabies simply did nothing for me. However, I will say that the program did give me confidence and peace during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> After 3 medicated births that were not what I wanted out of my birth experience I did some major research for my fourth baby.  I found Hypnobabies and ordered the home study course. WOW!!! What a difference.  I felt so in control and empowered.  I had a pain free birth that was more than I could have dreamed for. In fact my husband who is an OB/GYN and has seen hundreds of births said, \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know childbirth could be like this.\\&quot;  I make sure I tell everybody I know about Hypnobabies because I know what an amazing birth experience it gives to Moms and their babies.  I don&#x27;t think there is a better gift to your baby than being able to bring it into the world gently and joyfully without any drugs in their system. It&#x27;s a gift I&#x27;m thankful for everyday</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at 11 pm on Sunday and received it Monday afternoon. I was shocked! The product itself is great. I&#x27;ve copied all my cds and started listening on Monday. I&#x27;ve seen great reviews, so I can&#x27;t wait to put this product in action.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I had practiced self hypnosis, so I know I can be hypnotized. However, the verbal cues that the CD&#x27;s use aren&#x27;t right for me, but that is just me. I would have to visualize myself being totally frozen or something for hypnosis to work. Since this was my second baby, I had made sure to cover all my bases and did more than rely on HB CD&#x27;s as the only way to alleviate the birthing waves. We also bought a la bassine birth tub (which was a major help!), the warm water was a Godsend too, I also had a much better diet this time around (I read the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon), I took magnesium and made sure to have herbs to take - red raspberry leaf tea and lady&#x27;s mantle- a few months before giving birth. Though one of the suggestions did help me concentrate which was having your partner help, and I was able to talk and not scream this time around, ha ha! I don&#x27;t think it was a bad thing to do, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it as 100 percent effective against &#x27;discomfort&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent way to keep yourself from panicking during the birth process too, however. Everyone births differently, so this program may be great for some, depending on if you respond right to the verbal cues.</li>
            <li> Not only did I use Hypnobabies myself, but my doula clients have as well. I turned to Hypnobabies after two typical hospital births with an epidural. In my case, the epidural didn&#x27;t work! I became highly motivated to find a better way to birth when expecting my third. I didn&#x27;t want a repeat of my prior births, which were long, and excruciating.    My first Hypnobaby was a surprise unattended homebirth, it was that easy! My second Hypnobaby we had at home. There seemed little point to risking a birth on some freeway when we could do it safely at home. Both births were painless, wonderful, and I felt so good afterward. I&#x27;ve had workouts that were harder!    My clients who have done Hypnobabies have all had wonderful births themselves, peaceful and completely comfort.    There are several keys to the success of Hypnobabies. First, it&#x27;s a complete childbirth program. There is no need to take another class, thus introducing the very fear of birth you&#x27;re working to eliminate. Second, it&#x27;s the only program that uses up to date medical hypnotic anesthesia to give you the tools to control what you feel during birth. Third, there is a bounty of information on staying healthy and optimizing your chances of having an easier, shorter birthing by using diet, exercise and even physics (interesting that we forget that physics applies even in utero)! I have yet to see a more thorough program.</li>
            <li> I bought this 4 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child. I used it again with my second child. I was TERRIFIED of childbirth and I really wanted to consider a natural birth. This really gave me the reassurance I needed to be able to confidently try. The hypnobabies course helped a lot with being more relaxed and letting nature take it&#x27;s course. Now, my birth was uncomfortable and sometimes I found I couldn&#x27;t use the cues like I wanted to to just relax, but I still think it is a great product because it helped me to overcome my fear and confidently approach childbirth. It was certainly a key factor in achieving the birth I wanted.</li>
            <li> I just gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy and used Hypnobabies throughout my pregnancy to prepare for the baby&#x27;s birth. Since this was my first child, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and my plan was to have a natural childbirth with a midwife at home (and I did). The Hypnobabies Home Study Course helped me with being confident about my labor and delivery, which I felt was so important. I started using the program when I was in my 5th month of pregnancy and trained on it up through about 8 1/2 months (after that time I was just ready to have the baby and didn&#x27;t feel the need to continue practicing. I felt ready--plus, I was growing exhausted with the terrible writing style of the author and the way the book was put together. I agree with others that it was not the most professional presentation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This course was recommended to me by my sister-in-law but I had never heard the promise that this course would give me a &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34; childbirth. I never went into my labor and delivery expecting that and in fact, I thought I remembered the author addressing this in the study guide--that even though some women do not experience a pain free birthing, many women have shorter labors and are overall happy with their birth experience after using the program. If I had gone into it expecting a pain-free birth, I would have rated it much lower. But, my hope was simply a natural childbirth experience where I could relax and let my body do what it needed to do. And that&#x27;s what I got! My baby&#x27;s birth was ideal for me and I know that leading up to my delivery,  Hypnobabies helped me to prepare mentally--and for me, that was half the battle.</li>
            <li> I think this really help us out when it came down to having our baby, my wife was very calm and remember alot of the techniques not too bad we were very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I used Hypnobabies for all 3 of my births. My births were all hospital births, but thanks to Hypobabies I was able to have unmedicated, calm and peaceful births!! It only got easier each time! The last birth, the Hypnobabies tracks really helped me to stay so relaxed that I almost didn&#x27;t make it to the hospital in time,, dilating from 4-8 in an hour while at hime! I was in my zone thanks to Hypnobabies!! If you have anxiety, fear, and doubt about your birth or your ability to give birth naturally then PLEASE get Hypnobabies! I would have not been able to have my ideal birth without it!</li>
            <li> I studied this whole program and would recommend to anyone, sadly we had a distressed delivery and had to have an emergency C-section so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was successful for me.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I had horrible back labor and this just didn&#x27;t work out.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t have back labor this will work out, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your only preparation.  You&#x27;d be better off getting a doula.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have your typical hypnobabies experience,  but it definitely helped me with the experience I got. My son was born via emergency csection 5 weeks early, measuring 7 weeks behind, because of IUGR and placental problems. Obviously not what I&#x27;d wanted, but I made the best of my situation.  I fully credit hypnobabies with my ability to stay calm through all of the insanity that was that day, and the following weeks in the hospital. Definitely worth it! :)</li>
            <li> Really helped with my natural birth</li>
            <li> I found hypnobabies essential in my labor and delivery. I was able to labor at home much longer than I ever would have without it; having learned how to relax through contractions made them so much more manageable. It is a large time commitment to do the practices and CDs but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li> Diligently listened to the CDs daily and read through the workbook. I told myself over and over I would have a quick labor with minimal pain that I would be able to easily manage. Well, the reality was my labor lasted 60 hours with my water breaking in the middle. My contractions were painful and listening to hypnobabies through the contractions did not help. After all was said and done I felt it was a waste of time. I am pregnant again and will not be using hypnobabies this time.</li>
            <li> I used this for my 2nd.  I didn&#x27;t prepare for my 1st at all and was begging for an epidural by the time I got to the hospital.  This time I did it completely natural in a birth center.  I think the program helped a lot.  I used to laugh at this sort of thing but had an open mind this time.  Using the CDs to practice was VERY relaxing and helped with my confidence a lot.  My 1st labor was about 12 hrs.  This time I had 2 full nights of pressure waves that would die off during the day.  The 2nd night was pretty intense but I stayed focused and on top of the pain.  The next day I was so mentally tired that they almost sent me for an epidural.  But I stuck it out.  During transition they made me walk the whole time to keep things moving and none of the techniques helped at all.  I was never very good at the staying in hypnosis with my eyes open thing.  By the time I got in the pool it was time to push.  I think the techniques once again helped at that point to keep me calm and stay on top of my breathing.  Overall I am glad I used it and I think it helped a lot but certainly not pain free.  I didn&#x27;t practice as much as they suggest but feel I did pretty good.  It takes a lot of time and I had a 19 month old at home and worked which made 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each day almost impossible.  I didn&#x27;t use the tracks during active labor for some reason- I just wasn&#x27;t in the mind frame for it I guess.  I would recommend this to help manage through a natural birth, certainly better than doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I first heard about hypnosis for childbirth on a Dateline NBC story YEARS before I ever thought of even having children. The idea stuck with me, and when I became pregnant I searched out information about a hypnosis for childbirth class. Unfortunately, because of where I live (central valley, CA), there was only Lamaze available. I did not have the money to hire a doula, or I likely would have gone that route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time (October 2007), HypnoBabies was the only brand I found that offered a home-study course for their program. So after reading many reviews (from feeling no pain whatsoever to having it not work at all), I decided to purchase the program and use it. I can&#x27;t say that I gave it 110%, and my hubby did not participate in the program, but I started at 18 weeks and did follow the program about 90%. I did listen to the scripts each night, all night, as I slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first pregnancy and I was having a hospital birth, in an area that focuses on traditional hospital treatments for childbirth. I live less than 1 mile from the hospital, so I labored at home until my contractions (birth waves) were about 3 min apart, at the recommendation of my OB. I stayed at home, in my recliner, with light snacks and water next to me and just listened to the scripts and relaxed. Early labor just felt like pressure. By the time I was ready to go to the hospital, what I felt was more like bad menstrual cramps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived at the hospital and was measured to be 7 cm. Two hours later, with 5 min of pushing, my 8 lb, 4 oz baby boy was here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the program helped tremendously. I felt it helped me stay focused and relaxed and able to reduce the pain. I say reduce, because I had pain, it just wasn&#x27;t unbearable. During transition, which I didn&#x27;t realize I was even in because I didn&#x27;t feel like the contractions really got significantly worse, I really had to focus on my breathing and it just felt to me like the worst menstrual cramps. My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened to the scripts throughout my labor, even through actual delivery. This program really did work for me, but it was not completely painless as others have said it was for them. Everyone is different and I do not think that anyone should say that this doesn&#x27;t work at all or that it works for everyone, because I don&#x27;t believe that is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also should mention that I was not induced, even though they wanted to induce me on my due date, with no medical reason to do so. I refused to be induced until I was 42 weeks, which is what the ACOG (American College of OB/GYN&#x27;s) states is actually full term. I went into labor on my own 10 days after my due date, and I&#x27;m glad I waited. I do believe inductions prior to 42 weeks, for no medical reason, can contribute to extended and painful labors, even c-sections. \\&quot;Big baby\\&quot; is a reason they gave me to want to induce early, and I was told my baby would be well over 10 lbs. He was 8 lb, 4 oz, so large, but not a reason to have induced me early.My water broke with my first pushing contraction and 5 min later I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened to the scripts throughout my labor, even through actual delivery.

            <li> This product is everything it is advertised to be.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality and follow up from the company too.  I&#x27;m very excited to have a spectacular birthing day!</li>
            <li> Too much information. tried to copy Leclaire method which is original method. check out The Hypnobirthing Bundle  for Happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies. Much easier and it works</li>
            <li> I am very conflicted about how to rate this program.  I mostly wanted to come on here to write a review as someone who has used this program for 3 of 4 births.  I have learned a lot.  My first birth (without hypnosis) was very long and very painful.  I decided I never wanted to experience that again, so I bought this home study course.  My second birth was a pitocin induction in the hospital.  Not completely pain free, but I was relatively comfortable all the way up to transition.  I took a small dose of Stadol at that point and after it wore off, I had a very quick and easy second stage.  My third birth was very easy.  I listened to my CDs and &amp;#34;slept&amp;#34; through most of the labor.  Transition was tolerable, and second stage was very quick.  Perhaps I was a bit cocky with the fourth birth, but I expected it to be similar to the first two hypnobabies births.  It was not - I had about 6 hours of uncomfortable contractions, about 5 hours of painful contractions, and about 2-3 hours of begging for help from God.  I did use some Nubain in combination with the hypnosis for part of that time when it was tolerable.  When it wore off and I was nearly dilated, I resorted to screaming.  Second stage was quick, but I was pretty shell shocked from the amount of pain I experienced.  My point is that every birth is different.  Every set of circumstances is different, and no one should feel that this program is promising them something it cannot promise.  I do think my hypnosis skills were useful in the third birth, but it was not the kind of experience I had expected or hoped for.  When I push aside those expectations I had for what a hypnobabies birth is, I realize it was not a dis-empowering birth.  It certainly was not a birth to feel badly about.  I think the program skills are pretty great - I&#x27;d advise you to skip reading the blog and following the facebook page though.  I feel those venues are promoting the best case scenarios.  I have even seen them list &amp;#34;statistics&amp;#34; about the results of their program that I am highly skeptical of.  I was never never surveyed.  I bought the program back in 2005.  I would have stated that my first two births were &amp;#34;nearly painless&amp;#34; but certainly not &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t discourage you from buying this program, but I do discourage you from thinking it a sure bet for a painless birth.  A lot of rave reviews are from women who have used it once or twice.  I don&#x27;t know how many women have used it three or more times. (???) This was my experience, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I loved this!!  Nurses kept coming in to ask if I had the epidural. My husband even said, &amp;#34;I guess I&#x27;m so used to the Hollywood scenes, this is so low key.&amp;#34;  I was smiling in between contractions, listening to my music and enjoyed my birth so much.  They didn&#x27;t believe I was in labor when I came in.  Only complaint is I wish the &amp;#34;pushing baby out&amp;#34; track was longer. Maybe nothing can prepare you for the pushing part, but I felt very unprepared for it. Good thing that part only lasts a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you want a natural birth!!!</li>
            <li> Hypnobabies really does help me relax! I hope it works on my labor and delivery day 2 weeks from now.</li>
            <li> I fully agree with other reviewers who have commented on the amateurish quality of the workbook.  I want information presented clearly and in an unbiased manner.  I also found the workbook to be, for the most part, simply repeating information that is available elsewhere in more logical, complete and professionally presented format - i.e. Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, the Sears Birth Book, Gentle Birth Choices, etc.  The sequence of topics covered was not logical, and it was a waste of my time to have to wade through pages and pages of underlined, italicized, bolded text in order to get the information that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the Hypnobabies customer service severely lacking.  I wrote to them with a simple question and received only generic responses, even after 3 attempts.  I finally just gave up and got an answer elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saving grace is that the CDs are helpful in developing a more positive frame of mind about pregnancy and birth.  But the rest of this expensive &#x27;home study&#x27; package is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I chose to use hypnobabies as my birth class. I liked that I was able to do it on my own. I&#x27;ve already loan this book to three people! It&#x27;s worth the cost if you have time to practice... if you don&#x27;t have time it&#x27;ll be a waste of money. You need to have time everyday to practice/read the book 1 to 2 hours a day for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried Hypnobabies to prepare for having a natural birth with my first child. I practiced it each night and tried to keep up with the daily finger-drop and center-switch techniques. I had a hard time entering hypnosis during my practice sessions, but the tracks were great for general relaxation and helping to fall asleep at night! In the end, I could not concentrate on the hypnosis during my labor contractions, and the tracks ended up distracting me from the rhythm I had already found for coping. It was difficult to communicate to staff and my doula while listening to the tracks and I abandoned it pretty quickly during labor. I think I was meant to approach my birthing as more of an athletic event rather than a relaxing meditative experience.</li>
            <li> Really helped me stay positive during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love this course! I haven&#x27;t gotten to put it into practice for delivery yet, but I have already gone through the entire class and use the hypno-anesthesia for other things, such as dentist visits!  It really helps to decrease my anxiety and clear any fears that might exacerbate sensations of pain.</li>
            <li> Hypnobabies was recommended to us for our first birth.  I have in the mean time recommended it to many of my friends who had fears or anxiety about birthing.  We had a very successful home birth.  I&#x27;m sure in part because of the positive state of mind this material encourages.</li>
            <li> My natural birth nearly pain free and only 2 hours. I truly believe it was because if this program! If we have another I will be using it again.</li>
            <li> It was easy to follow. There are relaxation exercises that were nice. I still use them even though I&#x27;m not pregnant anymore.</li>
            <li> I did a truncated version of this course - basically listened to a couple of the meditations during my pregnancy. I did not buy in completely, or play the cd&#x27;s on the day of my birth. Regardless, I had a natural hospital birth with my second 9+ lb. baby. Super easy recovery.</li>
