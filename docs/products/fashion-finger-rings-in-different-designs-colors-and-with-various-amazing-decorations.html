            <li> Wayyy to small,more for a child</li>
            <li> I love the style of the ring and I would have given it a 5 stars rating but I ordered a size 9 and I got a size so small I can even wear it on my pinky finer.  I wrote to Vaga and asked to send a size 9.  I even said they can charge my account again. I have not heard from them.  I will not be buying any Vaga jewelry again.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to know the size, it is very small. And I have very small fingers</li>
            <li> It gets 4 stars cause it&#x27;s beautiful. I wear a size 4 wedding ring and this ring can only fit on my pinky! It&#x27;s a strange size. A bit too big for the pinky and a bit too tight for the ring finger.</li>
            <li> super cute . definitely runs small though, fits my pinky</li>
            <li> cute ring.  very small.  will only fit on my daughter&#x27;s pinky finger and she is a very thin 13 year old.</li>
            <li> This ring is beautiful but it is much smaller than i expected. I think it&#x27;s a child&#x27;s ring. It is even too small for my pinky finger.</li>
            <li> Cute ring. Not as dark as in the picture n the blue leaf is really pretty. Fits my pinky</li>
            <li> cheap metal, broke first day, took forever for delivery</li>
            <li> I had one of these and loved it, then unfortunately lost it. I found this ring that looked identical, but when it came in the mail it was made of really cheap material and looked nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty ring and looks like the picture....however, when I received it, I was disappointed to find that it was very small.  Would only have fit a child.  I let the seller know that there was no way it would fit....and was pleasantly surprised and blessed by the courtesy shown to me.  I received a gracious note and an immediate refund without any hesitation. I am happy.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly styled ring for my pnky.  Good weight not flimsy</li>
            <li> Super tiny.  Good for child</li>
            <li> Very cute ring. It&#x27;s about a size 4-4.25. It fits my wedding ring finger. Or I can force it on my other ring finger. But then it&#x27;s hard to get off. I love it though. I have a tattoo wedding band and although I love my tattoo. Once in a while I like to wear a ring and this covers the tattoo perfectly. Cheap jewelry always turns me green. But this ring isn&#x27;t doing that so far. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute ...pic is better ...but still cute.  I wear a size 7 on my ring finger and it slides up to mid knuckle  it&#x27;s not adjustable  I&#x27;m happy with it...especially for the cost</li>
            <li> Sooo cute!  My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> so cute! it fits my finger great! i love it</li>
