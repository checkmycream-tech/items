            <li>This is a great shampoo to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that Neutrogena ever mass-marketed this great product, but I have depended upon it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>Cosmetic and toiletry companies love to change products and labels!  </li>
            <li>Great deal, and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>But this Neutrogena Triple Moisture is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of promiscuous in the shampoo/conditioner area of my life.</li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo for it is the best for my hair and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>This Neutrogena shampoo has a nice light minty scent.    </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this shampoo keeps the itching and flaking under control for most of the year.  </li>
            <li>was glad to see that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Best part about this is it&#x27;s nice clean, light minty smell, not medicinal or perfumey like other brands.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is conditioning, I&#x27;m just going to switch to this as my main shampoo, and thats saying a lot for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was like magic.</li>
            <li>for those who have a irritating itchy scalp this is a great shampoo because you can feel the cool feeling on your scalp as you shampoo plus the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and have enjoyed the results!  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and most shampoos</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected more.</li>
            <li>(a little minty), works into a fine lather, and leaves my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>There are many dandruff and flaky scalp shampoos, and I have tried many, but not many for just dry scalp, which it what I need.</li>
            <li>This is the best I have tried for my dry scalp and it is hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>so bought it on Amazon (always a great place to look for difficult to locate merchandise).  </li>
            <li>After a few days, I completely forgot that I had had a problem in the first place, except this special tube of shampoo in my shower as a reminder.</li>
            <li>and a must for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Not only is the dandruff and dry scalp completely gone, but my hair is also shiny, smooth, and silky.</li>
            <li>In the winters especially I would get really a dry/itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I then used this shampoo again and the itching completely stopped.</li>
            <li>I do think it helps a little, but it&#x27;s not any better than head and shoulders over the long run.</li>
            <li>Not only does this shampoo cool the itch caused by other products, I can use it every time I shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But after one use, my scalp was almost normal by the next morning.</li>
            <li>This is why I stocked up and I highly recommend anyone with dry scalp do the same.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes dry winter scalps and as far as I can tell it does not wash color out.</li>
            <li>I recently developed a very dry scalp.</li>

            <li> I have had trouble with dry scalp and dandruff during winter time for years. I&#x27;ve tried Head and Shoulders, Pert Plus, T-Gel, and others, all to no avail. But this Neutrogena Triple Moisture is amazing. Not only is the dandruff and dry scalp completely gone, but my hair is also shiny, smooth, and silky. It&#x27;s awesome! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I plan to use this shampoo YEAR ROUND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now. The first time I used it was like magic. My scalp didn&#x27;t itch and I was hopeful this was the end of the road. Unfortunately, my scalp did start getting irritated again and now despite continued use, I&#x27;m still having issues. I do think it helps a little, but it&#x27;s not any better than head and shoulders over the long run.</li>
            <li> There are many dandruff and flaky scalp shampoos, and I have tried many, but not many for just dry scalp, which it what I need. This shampoo just simply soothes dry scalp. I have used other scalp shampoos and I find that they eventually, and ironically, dry your scalp. This shampoo is like skin lotion in a shampoo. This is the best I have tried for my dry scalp and it is hard to find in local stores. This is why I stocked up and I highly recommend anyone with dry scalp do the same.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! It moisturizes dry winter scalps and as far as I can tell it does not wash color out.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and most shampoos I try will make my scalp itch with continued use.  Not only does this shampoo cool the itch caused by other products, I can use it every time I shampoo.  Smells great (a little minty), works into a fine lather, and leaves my hair soft and clean.  My favorite shampoo!!! and a must for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but Amazon did an awful job shipping. One of the three bottles leaked, which leaked outside the plastic wrapper and into the inside of the box. I&#x27;m not sure about a return policy where I&#x27;d ship a leaking bottle back to Amazon, but I guess that&#x27;s what they want?!? I will continue to use Amazon, but probably would not use Amazon again for anything like this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have enjoyed the results!  In the winters especially I would get really a dry/itchy scalp.  Since I have used this product, I have had no issues!  I always disliked the fragrance of Selson Blue or Head and Shoulders.  This Neutrogena shampoo has a nice light minty scent.    This shampoo seems a bit hard to find locally.  So, I just order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great deal, and quick shipping! I received the product faster than the timeline stated. The basic shipping rates were a little high, but it was still cheaper than buying the product at the stores, if you can find it. Hard to find here in the Los Angele Area.</li>
            <li> During a 4 1/2-year battle with shock-induced eczema, I tried every OTC shampoo and prescription shampoo there is.  This wonderful product cleared things up overnight.  I know that every eczema sufferer reponds differently to different products, but if you haven&#x27;t tried this product, try it.  I hardly know myself anymore, now that I&#x27;m not weirdly slapping away the flakes off of my shoulders anymore.    And it doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell that most Neutrogena products have.    Now if only Neutrogena made a similar product for skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo to prevent dryness. Best part about this is it&#x27;s nice clean, light minty smell, not medicinal or perfumey like other brands.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I was having a hard time finding it in local stores so bought it on Amazon (always a great place to look for difficult to locate merchandise).  Cosmetic and toiletry companies love to change products and labels!  Swift delivery</li>
            <li> I recently developed a very dry scalp. I tried several dandruff shampoos, but the problem was really little painful scabs that were forming (gross I know) and I found myself constantly picking at them. After a few months of dealing with this I was at a loss. Then I saw this. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with neutrogena products. I was afraid the shampoo would strip my hair and not work on my scalp. But after one use, my scalp was almost normal by the next morning. After a few days, I completely forgot that I had had a problem in the first place, except this special tube of shampoo in my shower as a reminder. It smells nice and is conditioning, I&#x27;m just going to switch to this as my main shampoo, and thats saying a lot for me. I&#x27;m kind of promiscuous in the shampoo/conditioner area of my life.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading the wonderful reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately I did not find success with this product.  I personally feel the product only agitated  the problem .  It left my hair extremely dry and my scalp extremely irritated.  Keep in mind, I purchased the shampoo and the conditioner.     If you already have dry hair, I would not recommend Neutrogena Triple Moisture Dry Scalp Soothing Shampoo.  On the other hand, my boyfriend has oily hair and it does wonder for his hair.</li>
            <li> I used the triple moisture shampoo and conditioner and since i have dermatitis i decided to try this. i&#x27;m still suffering, but the scent is kinda minty and reminds me of something i can&#x27;t put my finger on.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, both with a \\&quot;full\\&quot; head of hair and buzzed, works well on my beard as well! Difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this shampoo keeps the itching and flaking under control for most of the year.  This includes winter when the air is the driest.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo for it is the best for my hair and dry scalp.  I was very disappointed when they discontinue it so was glad to see that Amazon had it.  Thank You Amazon you are the best!!!</li>
            <li> for those who have a irritating itchy scalp this is a great shampoo because you can feel the cool feeling on your scalp as you shampoo plus the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when I bought this until I went back to using my old shampoo for one wash and my scalp itched like crazy! I then used this shampoo again and the itching completely stopped. Let it sit on your scalp for about 5 minutes in the shower. It tingles a little and takes care of the dryness. Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for dry and flaking scalp. This product didn&#x27;t work on my dry scalp and I ended up donating this to a friend. For the price, I expected more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that Neutrogena ever mass-marketed this great product, but I have depended upon it for years. Now it appears that the product has been discontinued and I am struggling to find a replacement that works as well. Before finding it about 6 years ago I had tried EVERYTHING to control my dry scalp and not leave my hair greasy looking or flat.  I guess now I will have to go on another quest. Bummer!</li>
