            <li>Good product... Works pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than the strips came with the was i bought.</li>
            <li>This helps to remove hair easily.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I had way more success with the GiGi muslin wax strips.</li>
            <li>Took a bit to arrive; however, for the price, they were worth the wait!</li>
            <li>They are good in both quality and quantity and for a low price.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First off the strips did not remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li>These are much larger than pictured and I got a whole lot more for my money which I&#x27;m not complaining about.</li>
            <li>Good for price, ships  usually withing 15 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found these strips are thicker (more like thin fabric than paper, as the ones that generally come with the drugstore wax kits) and work notably better than those I&#x27;ve bought in the store as well.</li>

            <li> I can use 100 strips for a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried using these strips on my eyebrow and legs and they left behind large patches of hair.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive, weeks past expected date.</li>
            <li> These work good with the creme wax (haven&#x27;t tried them with hard wax) but the product literally took about a month to arrive! :(</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, the wax that came with the package was awful.</li>
