            <li>But I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>I, however, cannot tolerate the very very strong smell of cocoa butter, as it turns out.</li>
            <li>cacao butter smells like chocolate and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do recommend if you&#x27;re going to wear a nice top when you use this product to wear a belly band or something of the sort</li>
            <li>the most effective (not had itchy results like the others)</li>
            <li>The top of the lid says to use a blow dryer to warm the product so it can be pushed up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a sticker on top of the lid advising to use a blow dryer on stick.&lt;br /&gt;The product description page should warn you need to warm this to apply.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>These cocoa butter sticks are pretty great.</li>
            <li>so your top doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>There is even a sticker on the top of it that has a picture of a blowdryer...</li>

            <li>I love the sheen my skin has now that I use it.</li>
            <li>(I use a cream with urea for that, which works great!), but I&#x27;m hoping that now that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of the cracks using this on my heels might help to prevent cracks for forming in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell of this butter.</li>
            <li>Love this for curing cracks and splits that occur on my feet.  </li>
            <li>My dog love it more then me</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and quality.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to rub it on my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Even with that, I still love this product and just bought two more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>, I find myself craving candy bars sometimes.  :)</li>
            <li>I had a similar one years ago and it was perfect for travel because it wasn&#x27;t liquid</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I want to smell like a chocolate bar, though.  </li>
            <li>Nice light chocolaty scent...</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I am 8 months pregnant and no stretch marks - love cocoa butter!</li>
            <li>I first bought their vegan lip balm and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is good quality cocoa butter, and I like this large 3 oz stick better</li>
            <li>considering how much weight she was carrying and how much she gained this was extremely impressive.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly it works.</li>
            <li>I just hold it against my warm skin for a minute, and it melts right away.</li>
            <li>Easy applicator tube that glides over all areas of the body.</li>
            <li>The formula penetrates my skin rather easily.</li>
            <li>so that makes it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I carry this everywhere, and use it daily, and it is wonderful after a shower... smooths right on.  </li>
            <li>This product is great on general areas.</li>
            <li>This is the first 100% cocoa butter I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Although, during the warmer months, it worked fine without.   </li>
            <li>Smooth and calming.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous, and yes, it does smell like chocolate.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>I like the push up top to control how much you put on.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it it had a STRONG chocolate smell</li>
            <li>You do have to melt it with a blow dryer the first use, but not after that it easily slides out.</li>
            <li>It helped to GREATLY reduce some dandruff issues I had when using other hair care products.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these cocoa butter sticks--one for my husband who has eczema on his legs and one for me as I am newly pregnant and would like to start moisturizing well.  </li>
            <li>The cocoa butter absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is nice because its a big huge stick that you can twist up and rub on your belly or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to warm this product up first, but also I normally use it as a beard and hair conditioner</li>
            <li>Wife bought this to use on her pregnant belly and swears by this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kept me strech mark free so far, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>maybe I am one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li>This is the very first review I&#x27;m leaving online.</li>
            <li>Pure cocoa butter is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So great product, but you&#x27;re gonna smell like a chocolate bar for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to massage it into your skin for a few minutes after applying.</li>
            <li>I can even use it on my face after showering and by the time I get around to putting my makeup on (maybe 5 minutes) its completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Provided a nice compact way to carry wherever I go would definitely buy this again and again</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>These do and the consistency is also pretty good (its pretty solid at room temperature(60s-80s F)- Ilve in Northern California).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I think preventative measures are worth to try.</li>
            <li>Perfect quality and comes out easily if you blow dry the tube for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Used it on my belly while pregnant - no stretchmarks ; )</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>The hot water from the shower is just enough for the cocoa butter to melt and because it&#x27;s oily it doesn&#x27;t wash off but leaves a nice layer of moisturizer that I can rub into my skin.</li>
            <li>After applying the cocoa butter to my skin it feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>There are also the healing benefits that cocoa butter offers that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to buy more.</li>
            <li>You would be better off just getting a stick from your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth even after toweling off.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s pretty convenient, and it works wonders at moisturizing dry/irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The once thing to always check for is the smell, if they are the real deal, then they should smell like chocolate!.</li>
            <li>tried another brand that came in a jar first</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just purchased my second batch of this cocoa butter because it&#x27;s so fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Thanks AAA shea butter!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like chocolate and melts against your body heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The maker recommends using a hair dryer to melt it first</li>
            <li>It actually absorbs a bit better than Cocoa butter and has virtually no smell although I do feel like Cocoa butter gives my skin a nicer glow</li>
            <li>If you are early in your pregnancy and looking for a great moisturizer, definitely do a product smell check in a store before ordering if at all possible, because dang--I get nauseous 2 rooms away when my hubs uses it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much a pain as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it works wonders on dry and problem skin issues.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the strong chocolate smell is so yummy</li>
            <li>Aveeno can&#x27;t compare to pure cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>pure cocoa butter with no additives.</li>
            <li>Looks and smells pure.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really improved the appearance of my stretch marks, but using it for my severely dry lips has helped much more than any lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Good product but hard to get it of container.</li>
            <li>But the butter really was very high quality.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>After showering (cold water spray helped the itching), this is the best item to use b/c it tended to be</li>
            <li>Thanks . . . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a bargain price too compared to many natural or organic products.  </li>
            <li>I bought the portable stick to rub on my growing pregnant belly throughout the day when I&#x27;m at work, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to push the butter out of the stick unless you are able to warm it up.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure this is enough to last a WHILE.</li>
            <li>I love that my hands are clean afterward and the whole process takes only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just push it high and apply using the sides to work it down some before using the top.</li>
            <li>The wide applicator makes it easy to glide over my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but only giving it a 3 because it needs to come in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many expensive oils and creams and find this one to work so much better than the rest of what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Use your money better and get a bigger jar for the same price.</li>
            <li>but why I think this particular product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large stick is better than chap stick sized ones and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>just wish it was not necessary to first heat it to eject the stick!</li>
            <li>Really feel like it&#x27;s helped appearance so far.</li>
            <li>It has a soft cocoa butter scent and melts as I rolled it on my skin straight from the tube.</li>
            <li>I normally apply this product as conditioner about 20 minutes after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d want to walk around smelling like chocolate all the time, but the smell wears off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>i have a very dry skin and used tones of different brands of lotions but not anymore :)</li>
            <li>I now scoop a bit in to a aluminium foil cupcake/muffin cup and melt it on the stove(electric, but flame would work too), less than a minute on the lowset setting and I have a lukewarm cocoa butter in liquid form that is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally to get the beneits you have to get the huge tub, and break it into chunks, melt it down, yada yada.</li>
            <li>I love this stick because it&#x27;s 100% raw and natural cocoa butter, and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get larger quantities of raw Cocoa butter for a bit cheaper but this packaging is really convenient and really is very cheap already.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter goes on smooth; especially on wet skin</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I use it directly after my shower.  </li>
            <li>early look forward to ordering again..</li>
            <li>The butter is very moisturizing and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li>I also use it on my heels which can get pretty dry and cracked; it didn&#x27;t make the cracks go away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and visited a 5 star spa a few months ago</li>
            <li>Major backfire.</li>
            <li>Simply take off the top, hold next to your skin for a few seconds (so that it starts to melt) and roll it all over your belly, breasts and lower back.</li>
            <li>(I think) available at the local drugstore, but no more.</li>
            <li>but this is so much easier to use because of the wide applicator.</li>
            <li>My skin had gotten really sensitive because of hormones by the end of my 2nd trimester and broke out in itchy patches.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t end up putting too much on my skin which would have been a waste since your skin can only absorb so much of it</li>
            <li>Simply rubbing it slowly over my face or on my hand was enough and it let me apply it in much greater control</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for the ease of use.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> , I find myself craving candy bars sometimes.  :)</li>
            <li> I had a similar one years ago and it was perfect for travel because it wasn&#x27;t liquid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I want to smell like a chocolate bar, though.  </li>
            <li> Nice light chocolaty scent...</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant and no stretch marks - love cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> I first bought their vegan lip balm and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is good quality cocoa butter, and I like this large 3 oz stick better</li>
            <li> considering how much weight she was carrying and how much she gained this was extremely impressive.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly it works.</li>
            <li> I just hold it against my warm skin for a minute, and it melts right away.</li>
            <li> Easy applicator tube that glides over all areas of the body.</li>
            <li> The formula penetrates my skin rather easily.</li>
            <li> so that makes it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I carry this everywhere, and use it daily, and it is wonderful after a shower... smooths right on.  </li>
            <li> This product is great on general areas.</li>
            <li> This is the first 100% cocoa butter I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Although, during the warmer months, it worked fine without.   </li>
            <li> Smooth and calming.</li>
            <li> The smell is fabulous, and yes, it does smell like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> I like the push up top to control how much you put on.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it it had a STRONG chocolate smell</li>
            <li> You do have to melt it with a blow dryer the first use, but not after that it easily slides out.</li>
            <li> It helped to GREATLY reduce some dandruff issues I had when using other hair care products.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these cocoa butter sticks--one for my husband who has eczema on his legs and one for me as I am newly pregnant and would like to start moisturizing well.  </li>
            <li> The cocoa butter absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is nice because its a big huge stick that you can twist up and rub on your belly or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to warm this product up first, but also I normally use it as a beard and hair conditioner</li>
            <li> Wife bought this to use on her pregnant belly and swears by this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kept me strech mark free so far, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> maybe I am one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> This is the very first review I&#x27;m leaving online.</li>
            <li> Pure cocoa butter is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So great product, but you&#x27;re gonna smell like a chocolate bar for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to massage it into your skin for a few minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I can even use it on my face after showering and by the time I get around to putting my makeup on (maybe 5 minutes) its completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Provided a nice compact way to carry wherever I go would definitely buy this again and again</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> These do and the consistency is also pretty good (its pretty solid at room temperature(60s-80s F)- Ilve in Northern California).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I think preventative measures are worth to try.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality and comes out easily if you blow dry the tube for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Used it on my belly while pregnant - no stretchmarks ; )</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> The hot water from the shower is just enough for the cocoa butter to melt and because it&#x27;s oily it doesn&#x27;t wash off but leaves a nice layer of moisturizer that I can rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> After applying the cocoa butter to my skin it feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> There are also the healing benefits that cocoa butter offers that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to buy more.</li>
            <li> You would be better off just getting a stick from your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth even after toweling off.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s pretty convenient, and it works wonders at moisturizing dry/irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The once thing to always check for is the smell, if they are the real deal, then they should smell like chocolate!.</li>
            <li> tried another brand that came in a jar first</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second batch of this cocoa butter because it&#x27;s so fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Thanks AAA shea butter!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like chocolate and melts against your body heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The maker recommends using a hair dryer to melt it first</li>
            <li> It actually absorbs a bit better than Cocoa butter and has virtually no smell although I do feel like Cocoa butter gives my skin a nicer glow</li>
            <li> If you are early in your pregnancy and looking for a great moisturizer, definitely do a product smell check in a store before ordering if at all possible, because dang--I get nauseous 2 rooms away when my hubs uses it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a pain as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works wonders on dry and problem skin issues.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the strong chocolate smell is so yummy</li>
            <li> Aveeno can&#x27;t compare to pure cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> pure cocoa butter with no additives.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells pure.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really improved the appearance of my stretch marks, but using it for my severely dry lips has helped much more than any lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Good product but hard to get it of container.</li>
            <li> But the butter really was very high quality.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> After showering (cold water spray helped the itching), this is the best item to use b/c it tended to be</li>
            <li> Thanks . . . . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a bargain price too compared to many natural or organic products.  </li>
            <li> I bought the portable stick to rub on my growing pregnant belly throughout the day when I&#x27;m at work, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to push the butter out of the stick unless you are able to warm it up.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty sure this is enough to last a WHILE.</li>
            <li> I love that my hands are clean afterward and the whole process takes only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just push it high and apply using the sides to work it down some before using the top.</li>
            <li> The wide applicator makes it easy to glide over my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but only giving it a 3 because it needs to come in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive oils and creams and find this one to work so much better than the rest of what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Use your money better and get a bigger jar for the same price.</li>
            <li> but why I think this particular product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large stick is better than chap stick sized ones and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> just wish it was not necessary to first heat it to eject the stick!</li>
            <li> Really feel like it&#x27;s helped appearance so far.</li>
            <li> It has a soft cocoa butter scent and melts as I rolled it on my skin straight from the tube.</li>
            <li> I normally apply this product as conditioner about 20 minutes after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d want to walk around smelling like chocolate all the time, but the smell wears off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> i have a very dry skin and used tones of different brands of lotions but not anymore :)</li>
            <li> I now scoop a bit in to a aluminium foil cupcake/muffin cup and melt it on the stove(electric, but flame would work too), less than a minute on the lowset setting and I have a lukewarm cocoa butter in liquid form that is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally to get the beneits you have to get the huge tub, and break it into chunks, melt it down, yada yada.</li>
            <li> I love this stick because it&#x27;s 100% raw and natural cocoa butter, and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get larger quantities of raw Cocoa butter for a bit cheaper but this packaging is really convenient and really is very cheap already.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter goes on smooth; especially on wet skin</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I use it directly after my shower.  </li>
            <li> early look forward to ordering again..</li>
            <li> The butter is very moisturizing and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my heels which can get pretty dry and cracked; it didn&#x27;t make the cracks go away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and visited a 5 star spa a few months ago</li>
            <li> Major backfire.</li>
            <li> Simply take off the top, hold next to your skin for a few seconds (so that it starts to melt) and roll it all over your belly, breasts and lower back.</li>
            <li> (I think) available at the local drugstore, but no more.</li>
            <li> but this is so much easier to use because of the wide applicator.</li>
            <li> My skin had gotten really sensitive because of hormones by the end of my 2nd trimester and broke out in itchy patches.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t end up putting too much on my skin which would have been a waste since your skin can only absorb so much of it</li>
            <li> Simply rubbing it slowly over my face or on my hand was enough and it let me apply it in much greater control</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for the ease of use.</li>
            <li> stick makes it more portable, and the application a little less messy.</li>
            <li> Normally, the warmth of my skin will melt a little of the stick for use on my scar.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my face and occasionally my hair and so far, I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of this stick over the past 2 months of daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put it on the dry or chapped area, especially around the nose and chin and within a couple hours the chapped/dry skin is healed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find pure stuff anymore.</li>
            <li> It smells so much like real dark chocolate that I think you could probably eat it!  </li>
            <li> Ounce for ounce, this cocoa butter stick might be more expensive than other cocoa butter products.</li>
            <li> Either my wife&#x27;s hairdryer is not hot enough or something, it takes a long time to get the tip to melt just enough to apply it on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it on my legs everyday directly after showering.  </li>
            <li> The directions will say to heat the stick with a hair dryer, but I found that letting it sit in near boiling water for a few min.</li>
            <li> My doctor checked mine out and said it was only due to dryness and onset of stretch marks/growing skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought the container a little fussy and have gone back to a different container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind since I know that quality cocoa butter is expected to have this texture.</li>
            <li> What I got, I expected based on that.</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to get the butter to the right consistency to stay in stick form.</li>
            <li> Other ladies have cocoa butter allergies.</li>
            <li> and i find that i can get dressed immediately after i use it, which is not the case with other lotions and oils that i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> with least amount of oily residue left on clothes.  </li>
            <li> After initial push, no issues, really thick, but i like it for after shower.</li>
            <li> and only got one very small stretch mark, but</li>
            <li> Even after using it just once, I immediately noticed how skin feels firmer and smoother, and stretch marks start to feel less noticeable to touch and in appearance.</li>
            <li> However, my face is a little allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I use it twice everyday once in the morning and once before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that the stick is very difficult to use without warming it up first.</li>
            <li> She applied it 2-3 times everyday after her belly was showing until after she gave birth.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> I use on my face every night because it is over dried by the winter...</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> but thats just what you have to do with raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> and they introduced me to raw cocoa butter to help prevent strech marks and to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> that the 1 oz stick I purchased in the past from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> , I started feeling quite anxious about developing stretch marks, so I started looking for remedies to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was way too hard.</li>
            <li> But this product is rock hard; I couldn&#x27;t budge it.  </li>
            <li> stick is so hard it is like a candle!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> i would give it a five star if it did not delivered so late.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t usually keep a blow dryer in my purse!  </li>
            <li> but I found that unnecessary, even on colder days.</li>
            <li> excema is probably spelled wrong, but the spell checker is giving me nothing.</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to push the remaining butter up the tube.</li>
            <li> The stick is nearly impossible to apply without warming with a blow</li>
            <li> Quality butter, but bad execution of the container.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is good quality cocoa butter, and I like this large 3 oz stick better that the 1 oz stick I purchased in the past from another manufacturer. I didn&#x27;t need a hairdryer to soften the stick at all, it melts on skin contact and smells great! I also like this company&#x27;s packaging of their cocoa butter stick, it is sturdy and well-made! It hasn&#x27;t really improved the appearance of my stretch marks, but using it for my severely dry lips has helped much more than any lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It smells very very nice.. u need to warm it up using a blow dryer before every use. it feels like rubbing chocolate on your skin. i would give it a five star if it did not delivered so late. i have a very dry skin and used tones of different brands of lotions but not anymore :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  100% cocoa butter and nothing else.  Use it on my legs everyday directly after showering.  I can even use it on my face after showering and by the time I get around to putting my makeup on (maybe 5 minutes) its completely absorbed.  I&#x27;m back to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 months during my pregnancy. I use it twice everyday once in the morning and once before I go to bed. When I first bought it it had a STRONG chocolate smell but I&#x27;ve since gotten used to it. I do recommend if you&#x27;re going to wear a nice top when you use this product to wear a belly band or something of the sort so your top doesn&#x27;t get greasy. But I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize that you LITERALLY have to use a blowdryer on this EVERY time you use it. There is even a sticker on the top of it that has a picture of a blowdryer... You would be better off just getting a stick from your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these cocoa butter sticks--one for my husband who has eczema on his legs and one for me as I am newly pregnant and would like to start moisturizing well.  My hubs has found this cocoa butter stick to be a great relief.  Feels great, relieves itching, decreases redness.  I, however, cannot tolerate the very very strong smell of cocoa butter, as it turns out. If you are early in your pregnancy and looking for a great moisturizer, definitely do a product smell check in a store before ordering if at all possible, because dang--I get nauseous 2 rooms away when my hubs uses it. Major backfire. So great product, but you&#x27;re gonna smell like a chocolate bar for a few hours after using it. Make sure you&#x27;re ok with that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but only giving it a 3 because it needs to come in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Great smell and texture. Smooth and calming. Love to use it for massage and it is not too dripping or oily.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and wonderful customer service</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! Easy applicator tube that glides over all areas of the body.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product! Provided a nice compact way to carry wherever I go would definitely buy this again and again</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!  The directions will say to heat the stick with a hair dryer, but I found that letting it sit in near boiling water for a few min. works just fine.  Aveeno can&#x27;t compare to pure cocoa butter.  My skin feels soft and looks healthy. And cocoa butter smells great too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My friend turned me on to using a cocoa butter stick for some extra moisturizing during my pregnancy. I use this in the shower after I&#x27;ve used my body wash. The hot water from the shower is just enough for the cocoa butter to melt and because it&#x27;s oily it doesn&#x27;t wash off but leaves a nice layer of moisturizer that I can rub into my skin. I used to swear by Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter stick but this is so much easier to use because of the wide applicator. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth even after toweling off. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I get excema on my hands (tres sexy). This stuff works. It smells like chocolate. And I&#x27;m pretty sure this is enough to last a WHILE. I mentioned it smelling like chocolate, right? And yeah, excema is probably spelled wrong, but the spell checker is giving me nothing. You get me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- JD Mader</li>
            <li> I love it! It has softened my daughter&#x27;s skin and faded her scars from an eczema outbreak during the winter.</li>
            <li> Good product but hard to get it of container. Ended up using a knife to get cocoa butter out.</li>
            <li> This is the very first review I&#x27;m leaving online. Absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m using it on stretch marks on my belly left by recent pregnancy. Several times a day, whenever I walk by it on my night stand. It smells great, it glides on easily without having to use a blow dryer. I just hold it against my warm skin for a minute, and it melts right away. Most importantly it works. I&#x27;ve used many expensive oils and creams and find this one to work so much better than the rest of what I&#x27;ve used. Even after using it just once, I immediately noticed how skin feels firmer and smoother, and stretch marks start to feel less noticeable to touch and in appearance.</li>
            <li> I love using this stick. After applying the cocoa butter to my skin it feels very soft and smooth. There are also the healing benefits that cocoa butter offers that is a huge plus for me. Using this product has helped in balancing my complexion because it reduced scarring and blemishes. The smell is fabulous, and yes, it does smell like chocolate. :^D  The setback for this product is that some people may not like the &amp;#34;stiffness&amp;#34; of its texture before it&#x27;s softened through heat. I don&#x27;t mind since I know that quality cocoa butter is expected to have this texture. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter goes on smooth; especially on wet skin that&#x27;s why I use it directly after my shower.  The cocoa butter absorbs into my skin quickly.  I love the sheen my skin has now that I use it.</li>
            <li> Product is what it is....pure cocoa butter with no additives. Use the hair dryer as suggested to start the product to moving.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on like butter! I have found that the warmth of my skin is sufficient to melt a thin layer when I smooth it over my legs or feet, but it&#x27;s summer, so maybe if it were colder out and/or my skin were cooler, I&#x27;d have to resort to using a hair dryer to soften it before application. I doubt it, though. So it&#x27;s pretty convenient, and it works wonders at moisturizing dry/irritated skin. I use it on my legs after shaving; it&#x27;s soothing and non-irritating for the purpose. I also use it on my heels which can get pretty dry and cracked; it didn&#x27;t make the cracks go away (I use a cream with urea for that, which works great!), but I&#x27;m hoping that now that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of the cracks using this on my heels might help to prevent cracks for forming in the future. Oh, and it smells heavenly! Chocolaty, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> These cocoa butter sticks are pretty great. The once thing to always check for is the smell, if they are the real deal, then they should smell like chocolate!. These do and the consistency is also pretty good (its pretty solid at room temperature(60s-80s F)- Ilve in Northern California).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand that came in a jar first (I order them for my wife), and scooping then out, the solid gets powdered, and when you put the powder on the body, the body&#x27;s heat melts it. This process was just a pain this is why I brought the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick makes it more portable, and the application a little less messy. You get lesser cocoa butter for the price though, and the instructions say, to use a hairdryer to melt the tip of the stick and apply it to your body. This is pretty much a pain as well. Either my wife&#x27;s hairdryer is not hot enough or something, it takes a long time to get the tip to melt just enough to apply it on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put this in out travel bag now, and gone back to the one in the jar for daily use. I now scoop a bit in to a aluminium foil cupcake/muffin cup and melt it on the stove(electric, but flame would work too), less than a minute on the lowset setting and I have a lukewarm cocoa butter in liquid form that is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for travel, but not for home use. Use your money better and get a bigger jar for the same price.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell of this butter. It&#x27;s just that the stick is very difficult to use without warming it up first. I bought the portable stick to rub on my growing pregnant belly throughout the day when I&#x27;m at work, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to push the butter out of the stick unless you are able to warm it up. I now just keep it at home which defeats my purpose for buying it. Quality butter, but bad execution of the container.</li>
            <li> Love this for curing cracks and splits that occur on my feet.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Pure cocoa butter is great for dry skin.  Large stick is better than chap stick sized ones and last a long time.</li>
            <li> too wax like and have to melt with hair dryer, wouldn&#x27;t buy again in this form.</li>
            <li> My dog love it more then me</li>
            <li> Normally to get the beneits you have to get the huge tub, and break it into chunks, melt it down, yada yada. This is nice because its a big huge stick that you can twist up and rub on your belly or anywhere else. Its like a body bar. I am 8 months pregnant and no stretch marks - love cocoa butter! You do have to melt it with a blow dryer the first use, but not after that it easily slides out. Just push it high and apply using the sides to work it down some before using the top. Hope that makes sense.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this for his skin, he loves it.  He uses it daily and his skin is noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works wonders on dry and problem skin issues. Use it in the winter a lot. Put it on the dry or chapped area, especially around the nose and chin and within a couple hours the chapped/dry skin is healed. Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> It melts as you glide on your skin.  Not greasy and smells like chocolate without adding calories!  I have the jar at home and the stick in my office.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter minimizes sun damage to skin. I carry this everywhere, and use it daily, and it is wonderful after a shower... smooths right on.  Perfect size. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is great on general areas. The wide applicator makes it easy to glide over my skin. The formula penetrates my skin rather easily. However, my face is a little allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality and comes out easily if you blow dry the tube for a few seconds. Going in my homemade body butter!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the smell and quality. Bought for a 6&amp;#34; surgery scar. Really feel like it&#x27;s helped appearance so far. Will continue to use. Yes, had to use the hair dryer a couple of times to help move the stick up the tube. Normally, the warmth of my skin will melt a little of the stick for use on my scar. Anyone complaining about the need to use a hair dryer to get it started should have read reviews before buying. What I got, I expected based on that. Would buy again if needed, though I shouldn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t impress- or even work for me. I was super disappointed. It was way too hard. Even when I tried to heat it up with a hair dryer... I wasn&#x27;t able to rub it on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate...yummy. Ounce for ounce, this cocoa butter stick might be more expensive than other cocoa butter products. However, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for the ease of use. It allows you to apply it like a deodorant stick--just spread it over the target area. I&#x27;ve never had to warm this product up first, but also I normally use it as a beard and hair conditioner so that makes it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact for hair care I&#x27;ve switched to Kiss My Face Olive Oil soap to act as my shampoo and this cocoa butter stick as my conditioner for several years now. I normally apply this product as conditioner about 20 minutes after I get out of the shower. It helped to GREATLY reduce some dandruff issues I had when using other hair care products.</li>
            <li> Great cocoa butter...just wish it was not necessary to first heat it to eject the stick!</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter - using it for my surgery scar.</li>
            <li> Wife bought this to use on her pregnant belly and swears by this stuff.  She had twins both weighing 6.9lbs and only got one very small stretch mark, but considering how much weight she was carrying and how much she gained this was extremely impressive.  Would recommend this to anyone trying to avoid stretch marks.  She applied it 2-3 times everyday after her belly was showing until after she gave birth.&lt;br /&gt;She also used another Cocoa butter in combination with this one found here: [[ASIN:B000GG7NU8 Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Stick, 1 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter! It works really well. Yes you do have to consistently warm it up in the microwave but thats just what you have to do with raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product. I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and visited a 5 star spa a few months ago and they introduced me to raw cocoa butter to help prevent strech marks and to hydrate my skin. I love this stick because it&#x27;s 100% raw and natural cocoa butter, and is not too greasy. It&#x27;s great to massage it into your skin for a few minutes after applying. It does take some heat to get it onto your skin, heating quickly with a hairdryer is best. Although, during the warmer months, it worked fine without.   The only thing that bugs me is that when you start rubbing it onto your skin, the stick doesn&#x27;t stay up! I have to hold the bottom of the stick up to keep it from pushing back into the container.   Even with that, I still love this product and just bought two more. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! One stick lasts me about a month? It&#x27;s kept me strech mark free so far, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Mambino and Motherlove belly salve and this cocoa butter stick over the course of my pregnancy.  My skin had gotten really sensitive because of hormones by the end of my 2nd trimester and broke out in itchy patches.  I had to avoid using the Mambino belly butter and stretch marks started in badly in my 3rd trimester.  So I tried Motherlove and this Cocoa Butter stick.  After showering (cold water spray helped the itching), this is the best item to use b/c it tended to be the most effective (not had itchy results like the others) with least amount of oily residue left on clothes.  I love it.  It&#x27;s such a bargain price too compared to many natural or organic products.  The only downside is the strong chocolate smell is so yummy, I find myself craving candy bars sometimes.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would add that you please check with your doctor about any rashes that show.  My doctor checked mine out and said it was only due to dryness and onset of stretch marks/growing skin.  Other ladies have cocoa butter allergies.</li>
            <li> It has a soft cocoa butter scent and melts as I rolled it on my skin straight from the tube. I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The top of the lid says to use a blow dryer to warm the product so it can be pushed up.  Well, I don&#x27;t usually keep a blow dryer in my purse!  I purchased this for travel.  I had a similar one years ago and it was perfect for travel because it wasn&#x27;t liquid so I could take it on a plane, and of course it was spill proof.  Also it could be used as a lip balm and a lotion---very versatile. But this product is rock hard; I couldn&#x27;t budge it.  It smells so much like real dark chocolate that I think you could probably eat it!  I&#x27;m not so sure I want to smell like a chocolate bar, though.  I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
            <li> Anticipating heart surgery, I ordered this product.  No scar!!!! The surgery was cancelled,and I am claiming the cocoa butter stick made it happen.</li>
            <li> Hard to find pure stuff anymore. Used to be Kit-Kat sized packets from Hershey (I think) available at the local drugstore, but no more. (Matter of fact, I think I read that Chocolate can&#x27;t be called &amp;#34;Milk&amp;#34; Chocolate if it does not contain cocoa butter...need to check my next Hershey bar package)  Looks and smells pure. Kept 1 start because it is in a push up package that you have to initially use a hair dryer or something to melt a bit so it can move. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The stick is nearly impossible to apply without warming with a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;This stick is so hard it is like a candle!&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely not convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;There is a sticker on top of the lid advising to use a blow dryer on stick.&lt;br /&gt;The product description page should warn you need to warm this to apply.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d want to walk around smelling like chocolate all the time, but the smell wears off after a few minutes. Great for your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. I am giving a 4 stars because I couldn&#x27;t make the stick go up. I always use the blow drier and apply using my hands taking from the inside. The product is very good. I use on my face every night because it is over dried by the winter...</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second batch of this cocoa butter because it&#x27;s so fantastic!  I&#x27;ve been using it since the beginning of my pregnancy and with a 40 lb weight gain, have no signs of stretch marks at all!  It mentions on the packaging that you need to heat it up with a hair dryer to get the stick going, but i didn&#x27;t find that necessary at all, as I kept mine in the shower and the heat from the steam softened it just enough to get the stick going.  I also found that toweling off after my shower and using the cocoa butter stick while my skin was still warm from the heat of the water helped the stick glide on perfectly.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and i find that i can get dressed immediately after i use it, which is not the case with other lotions and oils that i&#x27;ve tried.  Nice light chocolaty scent...which my husband LOVES.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product but it is difficult to push the remaining butter up the tube.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s a great product it even arrived to me early look forward to ordering again..</li>
            <li> I love this brand. I first bought their vegan lip balm and loved it. The cocoa butter stick is just as great! Thanks AAA shea butter!</li>
            <li> This is the first 100% cocoa butter I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s amazing. Smells exactly like chocolate and melts against your body heat. I like the push up top to control how much you put on. Great product.</li>
            <li> Used it on my belly while pregnant - no stretchmarks ; )</li>
            <li> Written by Yuliia.&lt;br /&gt;This cacao butter smells like chocolate and is very easy to use. I am using my third stick now and here is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of my pregnancy, I started feeling quite anxious about developing stretch marks, so I started looking for remedies to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;I have read a lot about cacao butter and its benefits and decided to try it. This one is quite nice because it is so convenient to use. Simply take off the top, hold next to your skin for a few seconds (so that it starts to melt) and roll it all over your belly, breasts and lower back. I love that my hands are clean afterward and the whole process takes only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 months into pregnancy, I am happy to report no stretch marks. I know it depends on genes and maybe I am one of the lucky ones. Nevertheless, I think preventative measures are worth to try. I started to use this cocoa butter 3 months into my pregnancy. I used it every evening, paired with Weleda oil for stretch marks in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I should have looked for a roll on or push up cocoa butter stick. You literally have to heat it up with a blow dryer to use the product.</li>
            <li> I like it alot. I wish it went on smoother.</li>
            <li> Great texture , and smells great. Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into why Cocoa butter is great for your skin but why I think this particular product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get larger quantities of raw Cocoa butter for a bit cheaper but this packaging is really convenient and really is very cheap already. I only use this on my face and occasionally my hair and so far, I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of this stick over the past 2 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maker recommends using a hair dryer to melt it first but I found that unnecessary, even on colder days. Simply rubbing it slowly over my face or on my hand was enough and it let me apply it in much greater control so I didn&#x27;t end up putting too much on my skin which would have been a waste since your skin can only absorb so much of it and the rest will sit there, making your skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this all over your body then you probably will want to use a hair dryer to melt it since that will be faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub the stick on my hand or face until I have a good amount applied, then I rub it in for about a minute. I let that absorb into my skin for about 5 min then use a tissue to pat off any excess so my skin has a nice glow but doesn&#x27;t look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great stuff. If you like Cocoa butter but don&#x27;t want to smell like chocolate for hours, try using Baobab oil. It actually absorbs a bit better than Cocoa butter and has virtually no smell although I do feel like Cocoa butter gives my skin a nicer glow so I use Cocoa at night and Baobab in the day.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter stick is excellent.  You do have to heat it up with your dryer but it only takes about 30 seconds.  The butter is very moisturizing and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I put it in the microwave to melt/soften. The butter itself is very good. I thought the container a little fussy and have gone back to a different container. It is a stick but it is difficult to get the butter to the right consistency to stay in stick form. But the butter really was very high quality.</li>
            <li> After initial push, no issues, really thick, but i like it for after shower. Thanks . . . . .</li>
