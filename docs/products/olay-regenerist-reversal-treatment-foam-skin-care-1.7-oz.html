            <li>Very light, and makes skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>so glad to fine it here.</li>
            <li>The foam feels like silk upon application, smells wonderful and absorbs quickly and evenly, leaving skin feeling unbelieveably smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and works well.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic mosturizer and is so light because it comes out in a light foam.</li>

            <li>I have found this product does a great job on my face and makes it look younger and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I was thankful to find it available on line.</li>
            <li>not nearly is expensive!!</li>
            <li>Enjoy it like you should have fun and over and out.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any to sell at a reasonable price, I&#x27;d love to buy it.</li>
            <li>You do have to be quick to apply it but using a cotton square to spread it around makes it go farther.</li>
            <li>but it almost dissolves to quickly to apply, so don&#x27;t dally.</li>
            <li>This product is light ,airy and goes on smoothly - not greasy - my skin is soft and people comment on how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>In any event, the stuff works very well in terms of diminishing the fine lines and pouchy look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful to be able to buy up old stock, but don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll use when that runs out...</li>
            <li>The difference is noticed right away.</li>
            <li>I purchased first one at Walgreens</li>
            <li>I am an avid Olay product user.  </li>
            <li>I get about 3/4&amp;#34; below my lower eye lids, and it didn&#x27;t take a week to see the first results.  </li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months now, and the change in my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>With some products,even with the lower price, they  cost as much as in the stores once you add the shipping and handeling.</li>
            <li>The foam is silky but not oily and really smooths out the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
            <li>Very satsfied with this product</li>
            <li>Thanks to AMAZON</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know the original price, but I first purchased this product when it had been marked down to $9 at my local Kroger; since then I&#x27;ve learned that the Olay folks are repackaging/relaunching the Regenerist line, at the original much higher price.  </li>
            <li>This Foam leaves my face feeling really moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>The foam doesn&#x27;t last as long as most creams</li>
            <li>Wow I couldn&#x27;t believe the price!</li>
            <li>I used this product only 2 times and just dropped it, coz its very adhesive!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother and she loves the lotion I was surprised at how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and even sun spots have completely faded.  </li>
            <li>This smells like it&#x27;s really old.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get this any more without paying a ridiculously high price.</li>
            <li>Sooooooo happy, but afraid it will disappear again!</li>

            <li> I have tried several of the expensive ones, either from a fine department store or online, but they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> This product meets or exceeds my expectations for relieving my dry facial skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a nice base for makeup or natural look without foundation.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I needed this item and was not able to find it around near home</li>
            <li> sometimes it is hard to find it in the town i live in</li>
            <li> so do not know about if it works for wrinkles or for other things</li>
            <li> But the product itself has a funny smell, like it&#x27;s stale.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a product up and move on to the next&gt;&gt;&gt;but</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the description says it is a cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I have a hard time ever finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> but lately I could not find it on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it is very difficult to find in stores that carry the Olay line.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad that I cannot get this product locally!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry</li>
            <li> It can get expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that Olay has discontinued this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I cannot find it in the stores anymore.  I use and depend on it.  I love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic!  It smooths out all of your wrinkles in the morning and you can use it under your regular make-up.  I usually use a product up and move on to the next&gt;&gt;&gt;but I&#x27;ve stuck with this for 1 1/2 years now.  I hope they never quit making it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and the price is very reasonable. It is a great base for make up. I love it!</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and leaves the skin feeling like it has a silicone glaze.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves the lotion I was surprised at how inexpensive it was. With some products,even with the lower price, they  cost as much as in the stores once you add the shipping and handeling. Amazon gives some great deals on some Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> very good it works like it is supposed to.  Enjoy it like you should have fun and over and out.</li>
            <li> I have found this product does a great job on my face and makes it look younger and smoother.  I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to see some lines on there face I am in my late 60&#x27;s and it has really made a difference.  I purchased first one at Walgreens but now I purchase at Amazon not nearly is expensive!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it a bit like a toner, between cleansing and moisturizing. I am not sure why the description says it is a cleanser. It is labeled a Treatment. The bottles I received did not have any boxes, so I can&#x27;t tell you what Olay says, but on the back it says to apply it to cleansed face and neck.</li>
            <li> I love this product so I ordered two of them and they arrived the same day from different vendors. This product is a fantastic mosturizer and is so light because it comes out in a light foam. It is easy to apply and works well.</li>
            <li> great product arrived on schedule</li>
            <li> This product is great and I use it every morning before my makeup and again at night before bed.  It is hard to find at Wal-Mart so glad to fine it here.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but lately I could not find it on the store shelves.  I was glad Amazon had it at a good price.  This product is really good for skin that needs moisture.  It is not oily which is good for my skin since I have oily skin in the T zone.  The difference is noticed right away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and the change in my skin is amazing. My skin is clearer and even sun spots have completely faded.  I have tried many products and this product is the best by far. Thank You Olay!</li>
            <li> It is too bad that I cannot get this product locally! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this foam.  Very light, and makes skin feel so smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using oil of Olay products for fourth years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry Olay has discontinued it!  I&#x27;m grateful to be able to buy up old stock, but don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll use when that runs out...</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s so smooth feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for the price! I have tried several of the expensive ones, either from a fine department store or online, but they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> One of  my &#x27;go to&#x27; favorites.  I was very happy when I found it on Amazon.  I have a hard time ever finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this foam! It just feels wonderful when I apply it. I will definitely be buying this again and again</li>
            <li> I love it.Wish I could get it in the stores instead of having to order it</li>
            <li> This Foam leaves my face feeling really moisturized and soft.  I&#x27;m really disappointed that Olay has discontinued this product.  Buy them up while you can.</li>
            <li> Wow I couldn&#x27;t believe the price! I am an avid Olay product user.  It can get expensive.  I saved $ 20 dollars when I ordered with my Prime account! Hip Hip Hooray!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted! I needed this item and was not able to find it around near home</li>
            <li> they need to bring this product back to the shelves!</li>
            <li> I used this product only 2 times and just dropped it, coz its very adhesive! so do not know about if it works for wrinkles or for other things</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was great. I would buy another again if I had too. Easy to use... thank you.</li>
            <li> This product meets or exceeds my expectations for relieving my dry facial skin during the winter months. Great for the 40+ age group.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know the original price, but I first purchased this product when it had been marked down to $9 at my local Kroger; since then I&#x27;ve learned that the Olay folks are repackaging/relaunching the Regenerist line, at the original much higher price.  In any event, the stuff works very well in terms of diminishing the fine lines and pouchy look I get about 3/4&amp;#34; below my lower eye lids, and it didn&#x27;t take a week to see the first results.  The price offered by this seller is as good as anywhere.  I bought 3 since it seems like they&#x27;ll soon be gone.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t break out my face. The foam is silky but not oily and really smooths out the wrinkles.  Gives your face a nice base for makeup or natural look without foundation. I actually tried another product for about a year from my Dermatologist but went back to the Olay Regenerist Foam.  With in one month people started to compliment my skin on how younger and clearer it looked.  I don&#x27;t know how or why it works but I Love It!! You do have to be quick to apply it but using a cotton square to spread it around makes it go farther. The foam doesn&#x27;t last as long as most creams but you will see results and that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
            <li> The transaction and delivery were very easy.  But the product itself has a funny smell, like it&#x27;s stale.  I use this product all the time and know the smell.  This smells like it&#x27;s really old.</li>
            <li> The foam feels like silk upon application, smells wonderful and absorbs quickly and evenly, leaving skin feeling unbelieveably smooth and baby soft. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a foam, yes it&#x27;s lite and airy but it almost dissolves to quickly to apply, so don&#x27;t dally. Yet, overall I&#x27;d find myself recommending this to family and friends, no greasy film left on your fingers afterwards either, another plus! Enjoy</li>
            <li> Amazing - love it! Really does work!</li>
            <li> olay is great for women of all skin types and tones. sometimes it is hard to find it in the town i live in</li>
            <li> This product is light ,airy and goes on smoothly - not greasy - my skin is soft and people comment on how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get this any more without paying a ridiculously high price. If anyone has any to sell at a reasonable price, I&#x27;d love to buy it.</li>
            <li> Very satsfied with this product it is just the best that I have found. Seller superb with really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and has a cooling sensation when applied.  The only problem I have is that it is very difficult to find in stores that carry the Olay line.  I was thankful to find it available on line.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!!!! Especially for the price, I don&#x27;t understand why OLAY keeps taking it off the market and then bringing it back months later?????  Thanks to AMAZON I was able to find it.  Sooooooo happy, but afraid it will disappear again!</li>
