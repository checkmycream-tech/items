            <li> These things are amazing.i brought them because i had seen the men&#x27;s fragrance and loved the bottle and the smell so stumbling accross this i just had to buy.  So far the smells are pretty good and long lasting. The perfumes have a floral scent but not like a victoria secret floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> First time buying this but I love them!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all these!!!!!!!!!! They so math my body chemistry:) I couldn&#x27;t have chose any better! I will be looking for more.</li>
            <li> The perfumes are OK but the design of these bottles is a problem. They do not have stability (smaller base) and in fact I broke couple of them by accidentally brushing against them.</li>
            <li> Kinda ends up smelling the same.</li>
            <li> Great price great fragnance</li>
            <li> Cute packaging, great to throw in night stand, purse, office desk drawer, nice scents!</li>
            <li> smells so good. better than expected and also a good size as well . will definitely  buy more when i run out :) and also shipping was fast got it in 2 days without prime.</li>
            <li> the packaging and design is excellent. what I expected and meets loa offer made. I arrive on time. happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> love the smell they seem don,t cheap at all.</li>
            <li> This package for Woman also are very good plus will be a good occazion for any quik gift to someone .</li>
            <li> I love it I love the style I love the look I love the smell.and I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> 2 of the perfumes are nice but 2 are to strong for me. Cute containers!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and is a waste of money. They do not accept returns due to it being perfume. I tossed this in the trash.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells horrible. On top of it, they didn&#x27;t even give me the option to return or even exchange the item, some bs about hazardous materials. So now I&#x27;m stuck with it. I will never order perfume from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I am more of a floral, fruity, fresh scent type of girl. Two out of the four perfumes were in fact fruity and the remaining two were musky, something my grandma would wear, too strong in my opinion. I ended up giving away the other two to my landlord who is in her 70s. She loved them. So if you&#x27;re looking for all floral fruity scents or all musky scents this isn&#x27;t the set. They do smell good though, and if I was a must girl I would be completely satisfied. The price is great and you can&#x27;t beat it nor can you complain when it isn&#x27;t 100% to your satisfaction. I give it a B grade.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good perfume, the smell it&#x27;s so good and variate.  think it&#x27;s the best cuba perfume what i found.</li>
            <li> Buy for a gift, it was great</li>
            <li> I expected more because the men cologne smelled so good. Out of the four; I only like one.  It smells cheap.  It smells like something I can buy from the dollar store</li>
            <li> The tops of these bottles leak a little bit. It&#x27;s no big deal, just dont make them lay. They smell great though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> This set was a gift for my mother, she usually chooses delicate and floral scents. The four fragrances in the set are very delicate, without being too sweet or floral, whom use it will love to.</li>
            <li> All four fragrances have a nice scent. Each one has a uniqueness that I can choose based on my outfit or mood.</li>
