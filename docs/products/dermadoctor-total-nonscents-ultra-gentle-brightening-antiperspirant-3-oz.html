            <li>I bought this product based on many good reviews.</li>
            <li>I also must add that it&#x27;s nice when I do sweat through this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a life changer for those of us who have always dealt with this kind of problem.</li>
            <li>For me, this is a kind of \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>

            <li>I really love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love how it helps with odor and as well as brightening.</li>
            <li>for a year or more.  </li>
            <li>Talk about feeling confident....</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend if you are looking for a light deodorant  that won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost because it lasts a year!</li>

            <li>but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Many great reviews don&#x27;t mean it will work for you.</li>
            <li>my underarms are alot lighter after three months, however, i started seeing results withing a week of use and after i switched over to another brand and started seeing my underarms darkening, i automatically switched back and once again i saw amazing results</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing not to have to carry deodorants or powders around with me everywhere, and I&#x27;m still stunned at the welcome total lack of scent (good or bad) on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>If you have experienced all the underarm trouble I have, I so hope this product will help you as much as it&#x27;s helped me.</li>
            <li>deodorant goes on light while fighting odor and keeps my skin smooth and a the proper color.</li>
            <li>The first week I started using it</li>
            <li>My underarm skin was damaged by an unskilled esthetician many years ago, and used this product last summer.</li>
            <li>but im on my first month..</li>
            <li>I do wish to buy 10 more if possible</li>
            <li>first had a smaple from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and dare I say I am ready for non-sleeve tops and dresses.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I like it as an antiperspirant; goes on well and dries clean, clear and fast.</li>
            <li>My doctor told me that nothing could really helps but this one does.</li>
            <li>Used it twice now and I am not sweating much.</li>
            <li>I really hoped this product was my answer.</li>
            <li>However, I may consider ordering straight from their site as I felt that delivery took quite a while</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that my underarms have lightened much</li>
            <li>It is finally good to find a deodorant that keeps me from stinking and does not make the skin under my arms dark and gross.</li>
            <li>I was left with hyperpigmentation but after only a couple of weeks of using this product I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>price to high for something that does not help</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or a little more than a month</li>
            <li>but I just give my underarms a couple shots of cool air from the hairdryer and I am dry the rest of the day.     </li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, it does what it promised to do: lighting, reduced underarm hair and perspiration!</li>
            <li>it goes on absolutely clear.</li>
            <li>It dries completely clear, and it never yellows or stains any clothing or undergarments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had skin discoloration in my underarms for quite some time and it was really embarrassing especially during bikini season.</li>
            <li>I used this deodorant for a whole year and definitely saw a difference.</li>
            <li>Never irritates my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and its probably faster if I were to order direct.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and the bottle lasts a long time, well over 7-8 months with twice daily use!</li>
            <li>It does have a wet feeling when you first put it on</li>
            <li>This is what I&#x27;ve found...as other deoderants contain much higher concentrations and defeat the purpose (when used in combination with total nonscents, brightening antiperspirant) of trying to keep away the discoloration.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not very strong as a deodorant, so i end up switching off between this and my traditional stuff, but after using one bottle my skin looks/feels a lot healthier, so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off white marks on my black clothes AT ALL b/c</li>
            <li> is one antiperspirants with a lower concentration of aluminum,  which is also less likely to plug pores, cause acne or discoloration.</li>
            <li> Does not work to lighten underarms to wet takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> All of the other reviewers here are right-on.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer said, I can put it on after my shower and not think another thing about it...</li>
            <li> I bought this product after noticing my underarms were getting dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now and have noticed minimal brightening.</li>
            <li> (I mean, I am human</li>
            <li> I noticed a little change in my underarms skin, they looked less dark and now it&#x27;s been four weeks</li>
            <li> a little</li>
            <li> Before I found this one, I tried a few and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Have to wait for few weeks if the discoloration of my underarm will be lighter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t instantly correct skin discoloration but over time it has decreased the pigmentation!</li>
            <li> I ordered this very expensive antipersperant because a few days of using regular antipersperants results in redness, burning and itching in my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I think I must have used at least 5-6 bottles till date.</li>
            <li> For perspiration and odor, it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, so I&#x27;d be crazy to go back to the frustrations and irritations caused from trying \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; or perfumed formulas.  </li>
            <li> It has no scent at all, so there&#x27;s never any worry about smelling like rotting fruits or flowers, or worse.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that made me rate it to 4 stars is because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> crazy \\&quot;scent\\</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product based on many good reviews. However, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I got skin irritation and blisters after a couple of use. I stop using it to let the blister heel and skin irritation going away. I used it again after 2 weeks, and the same symptom happening. I contact the manufacture but they won&#x27;t do anything about it. If you decide to try it, and it works for you then great. Otherwise, don&#x27;t expect the manufacture to refund your money back. Many great reviews don&#x27;t mean it will work for you.</li>
            <li> All of the other reviewers here are right-on. I have always been a \\&quot;sweaty girl\\&quot; worrying about sweat stains on my clothes, etc. This product is a miracle product in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t rub off white marks on my black clothes AT ALL b/c it goes on absolutely clear. Like the other reviewer said, I can put it on after my shower and not think another thing about it...though, for the record, sometimes it&#x27;s a little wet at first but I just give my underarms a couple shots of cool air from the hairdryer and I am dry the rest of the day.     I also must add that it&#x27;s nice when I do sweat through this a little (I mean, I am human I can&#x27;t stop sweating all-together) and I just smell like me...not like stinky fruit or powder or vanilla or whatever crazy \\&quot;scent\\&quot; they have out in the deo aisle these days.    If you are one of those people who have been searching for a great antiperspirant and are tired of paying $10-$15 for the \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; deos that Secret, Degree, etc have put out (that DO NOT work) give this product a whirl. You will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s a life changer for those of us who have always dealt with this kind of problem. Cheers all!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after noticing my underarms were getting dark. The first week I started using it I noticed a little change in my underarms skin, they looked less dark and now it&#x27;s been four weeks and I can see the difference in my underarm skin color. It does an excellent job protecting you from ordor and sweatness, I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to brightening their underarms. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I bought the skin brightening version of this deodorant and I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with this product! I&#x27;ve had skin discoloration in my underarms for quite some time and it was really embarrassing especially during bikini season. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (including lemon juice and hydrogen peroxide). The label says \\&quot;please allow up to 6 months for results to show\\&quot; and I am not kidding when I say it literally started showing results in 3 DAYS! My skin is noticeably lighter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> Before I found this one, I tried a few and nothing worked. Got this but didn&#x27;t expect it to work as it actually does. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or a little more than a month and I can see a huge difference. My doctor told me that nothing could really helps but this one does. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance easy to use</li>
            <li> this is a great product for lightening skin under your arms.  it&#x27;s not very strong as a deodorant, so i end up switching off between this and my traditional stuff, but after using one bottle my skin looks/feels a lot healthier, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My underarm skin was damaged by an unskilled esthetician many years ago, and used this product last summer. I was left with hyperpigmentation but after only a couple of weeks of using this product I noticed a huge difference! Unfortunately, just recently another esthetician used wax that was too hot under my arms again resulting in minor burns, so I&#x27;m back to using the dermadoctor brightening antiperspirant. I have already noticed a big difference. I too have to agree that it doesn&#x27;t work well as an antiperspirant but if you use an antiperspirant like (Dove) which only contains 14.8%aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine as its active ingredient is one antiperspirants with a lower concentration of aluminum,  which is also less likely to plug pores, cause acne or discoloration. This is what I&#x27;ve found...as other deoderants contain much higher concentrations and defeat the purpose (when used in combination with total nonscents, brightening antiperspirant) of trying to keep away the discoloration. Well worth the money, and the bottle lasts a long time, well over 7-8 months with twice daily use!</li>
            <li> For me, this is a kind of \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product.  Prior to finding this anti-perspirant nothing worked for me.  I found this 8 years ago, and, in a way, it changed my life.  It&#x27;s amazing not to have to carry deodorants or powders around with me everywhere, and I&#x27;m still stunned at the welcome total lack of scent (good or bad) on my underarms.  I thought the darkened, blotchy skin in my underarms was a characteristic of my skin, so, imagine my surprise when Total Nonscents made my underarm skin look the same as the skin on my arms!  (I&#x27;m still amazed).  This product is so gentle, I don&#x27;t experience irritation, which can cause darkening, and even more perspiration.  It has no scent at all, so there&#x27;s never any worry about smelling like rotting fruits or flowers, or worse.  I know for a fact this lasts 48 hours for me, even though 99% of the time I&#x27;ve needed it to last 24 hours. It dries completely clear, and it never yellows or stains any clothing or undergarments. For perspiration and odor, it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, so I&#x27;d be crazy to go back to the frustrations and irritations caused from trying \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; or perfumed formulas.  One bottle of Total Nonscents lasts anywhere from 4 - 6 months, so the price is quite fair. I apply it after showering, get dressed, and forget about my underarms until after my next shower.  If you have experienced all the underarm trouble I have, I so hope this product will help you as much as it&#x27;s helped me.</li>
            <li> It is finally good to find a deodorant that keeps me from stinking and does not make the skin under my arms dark and gross. I was using the clinical strength deodorant in the stores. It helped with my funk but made the skin under my arms look like elephant skin. I could feel that it had chemicals in it I didnt need in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant goes on light while fighting odor and keeps my skin smooth and a the proper color. It is worth the cost because it lasts a year! I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me..or I hv to wait a while to c results..these things dont work like magic I know but im on my first month..so we will see from there..will keep it posted</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant for a whole year and definitely saw a difference. My armpits were a lot lighter in color. They have stayed this way even after I have stopped using it. It does have a wet feeling when you first put it on but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Used it twice now and I am not sweating much. Have to wait for few weeks if the discoloration of my underarm will be lighter.</li>
            <li> Does not work to lighten underarms to wet takes forever to dry.  price to high for something that does not help</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant. I love how it helps with odor and as well as brightening. This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m already seeing results but I have to say, it takes time. The one thing that made me rate it to 4 stars is because it&#x27;s so expensive. I do wish to buy 10 more if possible but I can&#x27;t afford it especially when the shipping is 3 times more expensive than the product itself.</li>
            <li> It really is unscented, which is wonderful.  Dries quickly.  Does its job.  Never irritates my sensitive skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave marks or stains on clothing, even after years of use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works all day and does not discolor clothes or leave white marks. It doesn&#x27;t instantly correct skin discoloration but over time it has decreased the pigmentation! Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this very expensive antipersperant because a few days of using regular antipersperants results in redness, burning and itching in my underarms.  I really hoped this product was my answer. The only difference was it took about 7 days of use to produce the same symptions instead of 4 or 5 from the $3.00 product at my local discount store.  I would not recommend this product to anyone! DERMAdoctor did not respond to my e-mail informing them of my dissatisfaction with their product.</li>
            <li> Absoutley the best product for under arm ordor on the market.  Best price also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last for a year or more.  My roommate used mine this year so it may last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first had a smaple from Sephora.</li>
            <li> my underarms are alot lighter after three months, however, i started seeing results withing a week of use and after i switched over to another brand and started seeing my underarms darkening, i automatically switched back and once again i saw amazing results</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a while now. Do not expect results immediately. I think I must have used at least 5-6 bottles till date. However, I may consider ordering straight from their site as I felt that delivery took quite a while and its probably faster if I were to order direct.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now and have noticed minimal brightening. Otherwise, I like it as an antiperspirant; goes on well and dries clean, clear and fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;ve been a fan of it for years. Can&#x27;t say that my underarms have lightened much but I would recommend if you are looking for a light deodorant  that won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Talk about feeling confident....this product works great.  I feel fresh and dare I say I am ready for non-sleeve tops and dresses.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, it does what it promised to do: lighting, reduced underarm hair and perspiration! I will continued to purchased</li>
