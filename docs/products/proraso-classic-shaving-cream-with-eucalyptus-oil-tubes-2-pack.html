            <li>Best traditional shaving creme that you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very cooling and refreshing feel to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of foam and gives a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I recently started shaving with a straight razor and figured out very quickly that I needed a better shaving routine which included a better shaving cream than what my barbasol or edge gel was giving me.</li>
            <li>worth the price...</li>
            <li>Because it works duh lathers up real nice and really allows me to get a close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed and nice and tight.</li>
            <li>Ordered it and it came very fast and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>but I like the idea of shave cream in a tube for traveling and the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need it is someone recommend it to me</li>
            <li>As a person that has only used a DE razor for a couple months,  I had significant issues with comfort,  as well as cuts and closeness of shaves.</li>
            <li>Smells great, tons of soap with using only a small dap of cream.  </li>
            <li>I use an electric shaver and wanted to start shaving while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;this product works very well and allows the shaver to glide far better than the dry method I used</li>
            <li>I generally do not enjoy shaving, but this makes it much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>When I converted to straight razor a year ago this was the first shaving cream I tried, and it&#x27;s the last one I will ever use man.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell goes; it is not great but generally pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have gotten extremely close and comfortable shaves since I got this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product is not cheap but is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you do not need to use very much for each application, one half of an inch for each side of the face works well.</li>
            <li>the knowledge is that before applying this of course wash your face with hot water pretty throughly and before apply your/this shaving cream use that secret shave oil.</li>

            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. And this was a great deal</li>
            <li> FEELS GREAT,GREAT SHAVE!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I love this shave cream. I don&#x27;t use a brush and was hesitant to purchase it but I like the idea of shave cream in a tube for traveling and the reviews were positive. It&#x27;s just the right amount of foam and gives a really smooth shave. Nice fragrance and it makes my skin feel super-refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Ive tried alot of high end shaving creams and soaps and for the price this is the best in my opinion. Leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed and nice and tight. Lathers up great with a brush. I wont be using anything else...</li>
            <li> the best shaving creme I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. A little of it goes a long way, so a tube lasts a while, making ti quite cost-effective.</li>
            <li> This product is not cheap but is well worth the cost. I will not use anything else!  Make skin feel great</li>
            <li> This product cannot be beat.  Smells great, tons of soap with using only a small dap of cream.  I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this cream for over a year now. We used to buy it locally.  Ordered it and it came very fast and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This is only my second review EVER, so for me this is a glowing review. I recently started shaving with a straight razor and figured out very quickly that I needed a better shaving routine which included a better shaving cream than what my barbasol or edge gel was giving me. I chose because of the reviews on the proraso and reluctantly decided to get it because I did not like the price. I can tell you from the second I put it on my face I could see where that extra money went! Very cooling and refreshing feel to it. As far as the smell goes; it is not great but generally pleasant. I am using in cunjunction with the after shave as well. You dont need the after shave, but the shaving cream is absolutely superb! Once again, I think it is pricey, but this coming from a cheapo. That being said, I doubt I will use anything else to shave with in the foreseeable future. I generally do not enjoy shaving, but this makes it much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;soap\\&quot; stype and the foam style, and this Proraso by far gives me the best shave. By \\&quot;best\\&quot; I mean the closest shave with the fewest knicks.</li>
            <li> Product lathers very well- smells great and lubs the face as well as any shave cream I have used.  Tubes came banged up but other than that- perfect.</li>
            <li> My second order of this.  Makes great lather, smells great, and makes the skin tingle after use.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price... I have a very thick beard and it makes shaving a pleasure!</li>
            <li> I use an electric shaver and wanted to start shaving while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;this product works very well and allows the shaver to glide far better than the dry method I used before.&lt;br /&gt;you do not need to use very much for each application, one half of an inch for each side of the face works well.</li>
            <li> Best traditional shaving creme that you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand or brush application- its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cyclist so shave arms and legs 2x per week.  Proraso is my standby and go to product</li>
            <li> When I converted to straight razor a year ago this was the first shaving cream I tried, and it&#x27;s the last one I will ever use man. Why ? Because it works duh lathers up real nice and really allows me to get a close comfortable shave and I shave daily for my job gotta look good man. The only thing I recommend and you don&#x27;t really need it is someone recommend it to me so I&#x27;ma share the knowledge is that before applying this of course wash your face with hot water pretty throughly and before apply your/this shaving cream use that secret shave oil. After that apply this over the top with a badger brush and that&#x27;s it man you&#x27;re good to go. You can do up strokes side strokes whatever man smooth shave anyway don&#x27;t have to worry about irritation ingrowns none of that plus it has a refreshing feel afterwards so. Just a great thing man try it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an old school safety razor for years now and this is the best shaving cream on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for the product but it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formulation but the newer, creamier stuff.  Still good.  Not the original.</li>
            <li> As a person that has only used a DE razor for a couple months,  I had significant issues with comfort,  as well as cuts and closeness of shaves. I tried different razors,  blades,  soaps. I don&#x27;t think it was any of these. I think it was the fact I wasn&#x27;t lathering the soaps right.&lt;br /&gt;The Proraso cream makes it incredibly easy for a beginner. I ditched the bowl and lather on the face for a couple minutes with my boar brush. I have gotten extremely close and comfortable shaves since I got this.&lt;br /&gt;This cream really helps the beginner focus on shaving technique by taking lather building out of the equation for a great shave.</li>
