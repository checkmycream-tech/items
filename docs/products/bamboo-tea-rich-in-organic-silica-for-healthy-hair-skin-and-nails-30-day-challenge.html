            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>Through some more research, I found that bamboo is the richest source of the mineral, which led me to purchasing this bamboo tea.</li>
            <li>i love it, i can see some differences along with bamboo hair and nails vits.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>I LOVE THE TASTE</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the tase</li>
            <li>started to feel better inside</li>
            <li>I make sure to drink it twice a day, morning and night</li>
            <li>Hi my name is Terra, and I love this tea.</li>
            <li>it have so many benefits, too many to list.</li>
            <li>I took their advice and after steeping the bag for one cup, I used it immediately to again make another, just as potent, cup.  </li>
            <li>Beautifully smooth taste!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tea</li>
            <li>I love this tea.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will order more this month.</li>
            <li>I love the tea</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so refreshing</li>
            <li>Love the tea.</li>
            <li>but I love the taste</li>
            <li>This tea was not at all like the tasty organic bamboo tea that I fell in love with a while ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an interesting flavor and aroma.</li>
            <li>I love this tea.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love this tea.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second order of this wonderful tea.  </li>
            <li>Flavorful, enjoyed it</li>
            <li>But I have faith :-))</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Not so sure about my hair</li>
            <li>but I have to pluck the eyebrows more when I&#x27;m drinking this.  </li>
            <li>but i love how the shipment came neat and fast if product work successfully i will be purchasing this tea from this user again</li>
            <li>I love the strong smell and taste of this tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the best first experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a new product.</li>
            <li>Every so often however what is important to me is that its growing healthy because it is chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; way i think this is the most genuine, once you research what is in it and</li>
            <li>and I love the light taste.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a cup day and night &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I ordered another supply.</li>
            <li>Very mild taste.</li>
            <li>I like strong tasting tea</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t strong to me at all</li>
            <li>Did not have to add any extra dress ups; this tea was very delicious in its own natural state.</li>
            <li>and mine was fine.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was hesitant because I didnt like the smell which is kind of earthy; but, once I got over the smell, I was able to focus on the taste which is nice and mild.</li>
            <li>Also within two weeks of drinking the tea I noticed a huge difference in my hair and nails.</li>
            <li>but now there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy it so it would be one of my staple products.</li>
            <li>The taste doesn&#x27;t do it for me, but I mix it with a pack of those green tea mixes for bottled water and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the taste and can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoy taking it to work and have it at home.  </li>
            <li>The product has a smooth taste.</li>
            <li>The tea has a light taste, I have it every morning - will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>good knowing that I&#x27;m getting just the natural bamboo in my system.</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>So far so good I&#x27;ve been using it for a month</li>
            <li>one of my new favorite teas!</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this tea.</li>
            <li>this is so true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  a tea drinker and will be purchasing  more very soon.</li>
            <li>Love this tea it really works , it doesn&#x27;t have a taste but it works wonders</li>
            <li>Was very surprised by the light and refreshing taste of this tea.</li>
            <li>The first thing I saw when I opened the package was the most pleasant personalized message to me and the first time I ordered, I believe, was February 7th.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m barely finished with my first bag</li>
            <li>The product came to me quick and on time.</li>
            <li>It has a mild flavor and no caffeine.  </li>
            <li>Tea was a nice smooth taste, definitely a keeper will purchase again.</li>
            <li>After I finished the package, I bought another cheaper brand Organic bamboo tea and didn&#x27;t see the great results that I had with this one (a lot less acne breakout, hair growth, etc.).  </li>
            <li>my nails are strong and grow fast.</li>
            <li>I have been drinking bamboo tea since July 2014, more recently i have been more consistent with it</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for hair growth, but the skin changes were the first thing I, as well as others noticed.</li>
            <li>Arrived early! :)</li>
            <li>I thought it was loose tea, was prepared for either but very happy that they&#x27;re individually wrapped tea bags.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that; being in the military my hair is in a bun most days anyway.</li>
            <li>and this was a powerful tea will repurchase...</li>
            <li>Love the tea so far thank you :-*</li>
            <li>Overall its worth trying and besides real tea is good for  you.</li>
            <li>I do know that this is my favorite tea thus far</li>
            <li>They normally break easily</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mild on the first day of drinking this tea</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know right now...</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I would say I have seen a great improvement in my skin and nails although my nails are still not as hard as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see if the amazing changes that we see will keep evolving or have we already reached all the benefits effect of the tea?</li>
            <li>The stronger nails came first, then the hair, and now the skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed changes in my nails, hair, and skin after my first 30 day supply.</li>
            <li>I feel peaceful when I drink it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference in my hair and nails!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the same bag twice, and I felt the first cup was not as potent a quality as this one.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering this tea again real soon!</li>
            <li>I love this tea, it&#x27;s my 2nd order</li>
            <li>These came individually wrapped tea bags - I love it.  </li>
            <li>Just had my first cup</li>
            <li>I had been in pain for more than a week when i started having a cup of this daily.  </li>
            <li>I got them interested in purchasing the tea, also my daughter has purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love the bamboo tea, I saw results within the second week.</li>
            <li>The first week I started to use it</li>
            <li>I have been drinking this tea for about a month and have grown to love it more than the regular tea that I used to drink daily.</li>
            <li>and my nails are very strong and have grown very long as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see positive changes in my hair growth and in my skin and nails too.</li>
            <li>thanks  advance; )</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by its mild flavor, which allows me to drink it without sugar.  </li>
            <li>I am certainly going to drink a cup a day and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I have to add real lemon to the tea for it to have a taste.</li>
            <li>I will try to drink it straight.</li>
            <li>you so much. ^.^</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need any sweetener or anything to drink with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it for 30 days straight yet because the heat here in TX.</li>
            <li>, my nails are a lot stronger and growing really fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing fast and I keep my hands in water.</li>
            <li>Soothing relaxing at bed time with honey really help in the hair growing department</li>
            <li>I drink two cup&#x27;s a day it really does work</li>
            <li>her hair has grown so much</li>
            <li>Product works very well for hair and nail growth....</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>but we do not wish to share this magical secret. :-)</li>
            <li>The tasty is okay not amazing - but not bad.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to tell if the length of my got longer since I have in braids, but I could see that it grew out a couple of inches from the roots and my nails appear to grow fast and feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>My new growth seems to grow much faster</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>but when I added a little bot of lemon and honey to the tea it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little pass WL, I love this tea my Mother drinks it and some of my friends also and  have seen hair growth.</li>
            <li>love the taste with a little cream.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly-kinky hair, so no excuses guys and girls, haha.</li>
            <li>i really believe this tea helped to dissolve an abscess that developed under my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I think at least for loyal customers should have free shipment or a combo pack tea &amp; vitamins</li>
            <li>But i have noticed a lot of new growth since drinking the tea.</li>
            <li>As a green tea lover I enjoy this tea as much.  </li>
            <li>Taste better cold :) will be order a 3 month supply soon .</li>
            <li>First and last...</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>and I have a bit of new growth which is coming in nice &amp; thick by the way!</li>
            <li>My mum and I agreed that this will be our beauty secret and honestly when people ask her what new cream is she using she is like nothing.</li>
            <li>My hair grew more, shed less, and was overall healthier.  </li>
            <li>add a tiny bit of honey (even without the honey its ok) to add a little sweetness and drink away.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my skin glowed and was clear.  </li>
            <li>though it really taste like the traditional bamboo tea</li>
            <li>Natural tea for natural me.</li>
            <li>As far as helping with hair growth the verdict is still out.</li>
            <li>Not only is the tea lite, but I feel very relaxed while I sip it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not use to drinking your tea plain then the taste my take a little bit use to, but when you get pass the earthy taste then you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Was a little skeptical at first due to the bold, earthy aroma that first hits you upon opening the package; however, once brewed, it settles quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I normally drink my tea as is and don&#x27;t add anything extra to it.  </li>
            <li>nothing strong, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>flavor was very bland and mild, drank at night before bed</li>
            <li>I have received my bamboo tea much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>TOO BITTER AND VERY PUNGANT</li>
            <li>instead ill buy the bamboo powder pills it will make my life easier than having the tea bag into warm water and forget to drink it.</li>
            <li>Ladies if you want hair growth long nails and clear skin</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and long.</li>
            <li>, it has a smooth taste and you can drink it hot or cold 2 cups a day.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up seeing results immediately-within the first few days, my hair problem was solved.</li>
            <li>Before I started drinking this bamboo tea my nails would break daily, now they are growing and are so strong I haven&#x27;t broken not one nail</li>
            <li>At first I started off sweetening it with raw honey, then one night I decided that I would just drink it without sweetening it.</li>

            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> Through some more research, I found that bamboo is the richest source of the mineral, which led me to purchasing this bamboo tea.</li>
            <li> i love it, i can see some differences along with bamboo hair and nails vits.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Ok I purchased this tea 2 months</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TASTE</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the tase</li>
            <li> started to feel better inside</li>
            <li> I make sure to drink it twice a day, morning and night</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Terra, and I love this tea.</li>
            <li> it have so many benefits, too many to list.</li>
            <li> I took their advice and after steeping the bag for one cup, I used it immediately to again make another, just as potent, cup.  </li>
            <li> Beautifully smooth taste!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tea</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will order more this month.</li>
            <li> I love the tea</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so refreshing</li>
            <li> Love the tea.</li>
            <li> but I love the taste</li>
            <li> This tea was not at all like the tasty organic bamboo tea that I fell in love with a while ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an interesting flavor and aroma.</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of this wonderful tea.  </li>
            <li> Flavorful, enjoyed it</li>
            <li> But I have faith :-))</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li> Not so sure about my hair</li>
            <li> but I have to pluck the eyebrows more when I&#x27;m drinking this.  </li>
            <li> but i love how the shipment came neat and fast if product work successfully i will be purchasing this tea from this user again</li>
            <li> I love the strong smell and taste of this tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the best first experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a new product.</li>
            <li> Every so often however what is important to me is that its growing healthy because it is chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; way i think this is the most genuine, once you research what is in it and</li>
            <li> and I love the light taste.</li>
            <li> I enjoy a cup day and night &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I ordered another supply.</li>
            <li> Very mild taste.</li>
            <li> I like strong tasting tea</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t strong to me at all</li>
            <li> Did not have to add any extra dress ups; this tea was very delicious in its own natural state.</li>
            <li> and mine was fine.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was hesitant because I didnt like the smell which is kind of earthy; but, once I got over the smell, I was able to focus on the taste which is nice and mild.</li>
            <li> Also within two weeks of drinking the tea I noticed a huge difference in my hair and nails.</li>
            <li> but now there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy it so it would be one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> The taste doesn&#x27;t do it for me, but I mix it with a pack of those green tea mixes for bottled water and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the taste and can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking it to work and have it at home.  </li>
            <li> The product has a smooth taste.</li>
            <li> The tea has a light taste, I have it every morning - will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> good knowing that I&#x27;m getting just the natural bamboo in my system.</li>
            <li> So far so good..</li>
            <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve been using it for a month</li>
            <li> one of my new favorite teas!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this tea.</li>
            <li> this is so true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a tea drinker and will be purchasing  more very soon.</li>
            <li> Love this tea it really works , it doesn&#x27;t have a taste but it works wonders</li>
            <li> Was very surprised by the light and refreshing taste of this tea.</li>
            <li> The first thing I saw when I opened the package was the most pleasant personalized message to me and the first time I ordered, I believe, was February 7th.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m barely finished with my first bag</li>
            <li> The product came to me quick and on time.</li>
            <li> It has a mild flavor and no caffeine.  </li>
            <li> Tea was a nice smooth taste, definitely a keeper will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After I finished the package, I bought another cheaper brand Organic bamboo tea and didn&#x27;t see the great results that I had with this one (a lot less acne breakout, hair growth, etc.).  </li>
            <li> my nails are strong and grow fast.</li>
            <li> I have been drinking bamboo tea since July 2014, more recently i have been more consistent with it</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for hair growth, but the skin changes were the first thing I, as well as others noticed.</li>
            <li> Arrived early! :)</li>
            <li> I thought it was loose tea, was prepared for either but very happy that they&#x27;re individually wrapped tea bags.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that; being in the military my hair is in a bun most days anyway.</li>
            <li> and this was a powerful tea will repurchase...</li>
            <li> Love the tea so far thank you :-*</li>
            <li> Overall its worth trying and besides real tea is good for  you.</li>
            <li> I do know that this is my favorite tea thus far</li>
            <li> They normally break easily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild on the first day of drinking this tea</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know right now...</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I would say I have seen a great improvement in my skin and nails although my nails are still not as hard as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if the amazing changes that we see will keep evolving or have we already reached all the benefits effect of the tea?</li>
            <li> The stronger nails came first, then the hair, and now the skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed changes in my nails, hair, and skin after my first 30 day supply.</li>
            <li> I feel peaceful when I drink it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> and I really see a difference in my hair and nails!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the same bag twice, and I felt the first cup was not as potent a quality as this one.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering this tea again real soon!</li>
            <li> I love this tea, it&#x27;s my 2nd order</li>
            <li> These came individually wrapped tea bags - I love it.  </li>
            <li> Just had my first cup</li>
            <li> I had been in pain for more than a week when i started having a cup of this daily.  </li>
            <li> I got them interested in purchasing the tea, also my daughter has purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I love the bamboo tea, I saw results within the second week.</li>
            <li> The first week I started to use it</li>
            <li> I have been drinking this tea for about a month and have grown to love it more than the regular tea that I used to drink daily.</li>
            <li> and my nails are very strong and have grown very long as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see positive changes in my hair growth and in my skin and nails too.</li>
            <li> thanks  advance; )</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by its mild flavor, which allows me to drink it without sugar.  </li>
            <li> I am certainly going to drink a cup a day and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I have to add real lemon to the tea for it to have a taste.</li>
            <li> I will try to drink it straight.</li>
            <li> you so much. ^.^</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need any sweetener or anything to drink with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for 30 days straight yet because the heat here in TX.</li>
            <li> , my nails are a lot stronger and growing really fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing fast and I keep my hands in water.</li>
            <li> Soothing relaxing at bed time with honey really help in the hair growing department</li>
            <li> I drink two cup&#x27;s a day it really does work</li>
            <li> her hair has grown so much</li>
            <li> Product works very well for hair and nail growth....</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> but we do not wish to share this magical secret. :-)</li>
            <li> The tasty is okay not amazing - but not bad.</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to tell if the length of my got longer since I have in braids, but I could see that it grew out a couple of inches from the roots and my nails appear to grow fast and feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> My new growth seems to grow much faster</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> but when I added a little bot of lemon and honey to the tea it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little pass WL, I love this tea my Mother drinks it and some of my friends also and  have seen hair growth.</li>
            <li> love the taste with a little cream.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly-kinky hair, so no excuses guys and girls, haha.</li>
            <li> i really believe this tea helped to dissolve an abscess that developed under my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I think at least for loyal customers should have free shipment or a combo pack tea &amp; vitamins</li>
            <li> But i have noticed a lot of new growth since drinking the tea.</li>
            <li> As a green tea lover I enjoy this tea as much.  </li>
            <li> Taste better cold :) will be order a 3 month supply soon .</li>
            <li> First and last...</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> and I have a bit of new growth which is coming in nice &amp; thick by the way!</li>
            <li> My mum and I agreed that this will be our beauty secret and honestly when people ask her what new cream is she using she is like nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair grew more, shed less, and was overall healthier.  </li>
            <li> add a tiny bit of honey (even without the honey its ok) to add a little sweetness and drink away.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my skin glowed and was clear.  </li>
            <li> though it really taste like the traditional bamboo tea</li>
            <li> Natural tea for natural me.</li>
            <li> As far as helping with hair growth the verdict is still out.</li>
            <li> Not only is the tea lite, but I feel very relaxed while I sip it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not use to drinking your tea plain then the taste my take a little bit use to, but when you get pass the earthy taste then you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first due to the bold, earthy aroma that first hits you upon opening the package; however, once brewed, it settles quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I normally drink my tea as is and don&#x27;t add anything extra to it.  </li>
            <li> nothing strong, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> flavor was very bland and mild, drank at night before bed</li>
            <li> I have received my bamboo tea much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> TOO BITTER AND VERY PUNGANT</li>
            <li> instead ill buy the bamboo powder pills it will make my life easier than having the tea bag into warm water and forget to drink it.</li>
            <li> Ladies if you want hair growth long nails and clear skin</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and long.</li>
            <li> , it has a smooth taste and you can drink it hot or cold 2 cups a day.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up seeing results immediately-within the first few days, my hair problem was solved.</li>
            <li> Before I started drinking this bamboo tea my nails would break daily, now they are growing and are so strong I haven&#x27;t broken not one nail</li>
            <li> At first I started off sweetening it with raw honey, then one night I decided that I would just drink it without sweetening it.</li>
            <li> Regarding my hair in the last 8 weeks they grew at least 40% more than usual and they are thicker.</li>
            <li> It has a distinct flavor that sets it apart from all other teas including green and black tea.</li>
            <li> I have tried other things, that may work on one thing and trigger another problem or its just not natural..</li>
            <li> To give it a little kick, I squeeze a tiny bit of lemon juice and honey</li>
            <li> Only had for a few days..</li>
            <li> but it can get little pricey after a while especially when you buy other vitamins that you take for yourself.</li>
            <li> I am noticing the other benefits over time ie.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely worried.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but</li>
            <li> After the third day I was amazed to discover that I did not feel the usual soreness after a gym workout.  </li>
            <li> I have to go to the nail shop every other week</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve been drinking it (I drink 1-3 cups a day with the same bag), my hair has grown crazy fast, and it feels smoother and softer than ever.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be bland like green tea.</li>
            <li> I just gulp it down and be on my way.</li>
            <li> I seen one of the ladies the other day in the store who I told about Bamboo Tea OMG!</li>
            <li> My nails got stronger and I noticed less spliting.</li>
            <li> It came less than a week after ordering.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit softer, and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s grown much because I forgot to take pictures, but my nails are definitely growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> I just add a little honey and lemon</li>
            <li> As for hair, it has seemed to change my curl pattern a little.</li>
            <li> It is green color with no taste or smell.</li>
            <li> I drank the tea everyday</li>
            <li> I drink this tea religiously everyday</li>
            <li> she said I have to drink my tea everyday.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, my eyelashes grew-and other people noticed.</li>
            <li> Feeling frustrated and anxious, I desperately sought to take the matter into my own hands.</li>
            <li> so when I graduated from college, I started to shed hair excessively</li>
            <li> (In my fake English accent).</li>
            <li> I am not sure about hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li> I usually just throw a tea bag into my water bottle and go.</li>
            <li> I have been drinking it for the past 30 days and have noticed difference in my hair and nail growth.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, im not a tea drinker</li>
            <li> I decided to drink it at least twice a day, re-using the tea bag.</li>
            <li> Slowly my skin glowed like crazy and I even converted my mum and dad (they have only been using for 6 weeks or so</li>
            <li> It does have a subtle grassy  taste...</li>
            <li> I think EVERYONE should try it out, i mean who doesnt want healthy/strong hair, glowy skin and stronger nails?!</li>
            <li> also my skin isn&#x27;t tired looking, I&#x27;m not kidding,...</li>

            <li> I drink it cold with stevia and sometimes lemon or lime</li>
            <li> Because it does not taste bad and</li>
            <li> I know its bad</li>
            <li> YET I WAS DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Drinking this tea by itself is a no no for me because it tastes awful even with sugar added.</li>
            <li> This tea is awful drinking without a sweetner added.</li>

            <li> This tea has not taste at all. I have to add real lemon to the tea for it to have a taste. I hope it grows my hair but I don&#x27;t know right now...I love tea and I love mixing tea so I can deal with this tea to make it better. Drinking this tea by itself is a no no for me because it tastes awful even with sugar added. It is green color with no taste or smell. This tea is awful drinking without a sweetner added. I add sugar and lemons to mine. I will try to drink it straight.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been drinking the tea for 1 week and just started the supplements. Before Beautifully Bamboo, every morning my hair would fall out! In just one week, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is not falling out!  If this is all that it will do than I&#x27;m a satisfied customer and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I like this tea.  It does have a subtle grassy  taste...nothing strong, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Great for growing strong, healthy hair and nails! Shipped very fast. Awesome seller!</li>
            <li> This Tea is the best thing for growing your hair, strengthening your nails, and bringing that glow to your skin.  The stronger nails came first, then the hair, and now the skin.  I am nearing the end of my second order and will start ordering 3 bags at a time.  This tea is the best supplement I have ever tried and has replaced my daily cup of coffee.  Thumbs Up for Beautifully Bamboo!</li>
            <li> I have been drinking bamboo tea since July 2014, more recently i have been more consistent with it and I LOVE IT!! Honestly, im not a tea drinker but i drink this; A. Because it does not taste bad and B. It works!!! MY EYE LASHES HAVE GROWN!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just add a tiny bit of honey (even without the honey its ok) to add a little sweetness and drink away. It does the job which is why i do not plan to stop drinking it any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in a healthier state!! Its growing nicely. I have short hair by choice so im cutting it Every so often however what is important to me is that its growing healthy because it is chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the change in me!!  i like to try to eat healthy but adding this to my &#x27;diet&#x27; has has made my skin glo more and  my nails  stronger!!&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the things i hear about to improve ur hair in a &amp;#34;naturally healthy&amp;#34; way i think this is the most genuine, once you research what is in it and where it comes from you will understand. I have tried other things, that may work on one thing and trigger another problem or its just not natural.. Im not the type of person to find something that works and keep it to myself so nobody else benefits.. I think EVERYONE should try it out, i mean who doesnt want healthy/strong hair, glowy skin and stronger nails?!</li>
            <li> I love the strong smell and taste of this tea.&lt;br /&gt;There actually some differences between the korean bamboo tea and the chinesee.&lt;br /&gt;This one is chinesse and happens to feel stronger in taste and smell i rather these one so much.&lt;br /&gt;It brought 29 bags, i though it was coming with the herbs losee in the bag only.&lt;br /&gt;Within the tea bags you cant notice it is the dust of the tea not the plant looking like as you will see it in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it really taste like the traditional bamboo tea and i love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tea for a second time.  I noticed changes in my nails, hair, and skin after my first 30 day supply. I drank the tea everyday and I noticed my skin glowed and was clear.  I got compliments on my skin while using this product.  My hair grew more, shed less, and was overall healthier.  My nails got stronger and I noticed less spliting. I would recommend this product for someone looking to improve their hair, nails, and skin.</li>
            <li> This was the best first experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a new product. The first thing I saw when I opened the package was the most pleasant personalized message to me and the first time I ordered, I believe, was February 7th.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m barely finished with my first bag and I&#x27;m ordering another; I&#x27;m also seeing benefits despite the fact that I haven&#x27;t been drinking it daily. I have naturally curly-kinky hair, so no excuses guys and girls, haha. I love this tea and the seller and customer service is a big reason why I&#x27;m purchasing again. (:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much. ^.^</li>
            <li> I would say I have seen a great improvement in my skin and nails although my nails are still not as hard as I would like them to be. However, I can&#x27;t testify just yet on my hair growth so I would write a follow up review on that since I have a sew-in at the moment. But I think this tea soothes and calms me. I feel peaceful when I drink it. I have shared it with my sister and she loves it. She thinks she is already seeing her eyebrows thickening up. I am on my third bag and she is on her second. I truly enjoy it so it would be one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> I like this tea alot.  I drink it without any sugar or sugar subsitutes at all.  I can&#x27;t say that it has contributed to substantial amount of hair growth, but something in this tea is causing a detox effect and I have lost some weight, so for that alone I am pleased.  I will continue to take and update later.</li>
            <li> Excellent taste! Awesome for silica daily. Overall my fav bamboo tea brand.</li>
            <li> The taste doesn&#x27;t do it for me, but I mix it with a pack of those green tea mixes for bottled water and it&#x27;s perfect. My hair is a bit softer, and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s grown much because I forgot to take pictures, but my nails are definitely growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> Tried and I liked the tea will order more.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this tea. Will order more before I run out. It taste great I just add a little honey and lemon</li>
            <li> This tea has a great taste to it. You don&#x27;t really need any sweetener or anything to drink with it. I haven&#x27;t tried it for 30 days straight yet because the heat here in TX. But I love it!</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to tell if the length of my got longer since I have in braids, but I could see that it grew out a couple of inches from the roots and my nails appear to grow fast and feels thicker.  I am planning to get the Bamboo tablets to see how well that will work.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the taste and can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say the reviews alone convinced me to purchase this product so it seems fair that I encourage someone else to experience the benefits of bamboo tea. First and last...my eyelashes grew. I am noticing the other benefits over time ie. thicker hair,stronger nails and yes people are saying my skin is glowing (it&#x27;s like pregnancy without the pains!) so I have to tell it to the amazon world....get some. cause it works! Seriously though, my eyelashes grew-and other people noticed.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft! Not just my face; all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life. I originally purchased this for hair growth, but the skin changes were the first thing I, as well as others noticed. As for hair, it has seemed to change my curl pattern a little. I&#x27;m okay with that; being in the military my hair is in a bun most days anyway. I have been drinking the tea in conjunction with the Beautiful Bamboo supplements. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good tasting tea. My nails seem stronger.</li>
            <li> Great taste no sweetener needed.</li>
            <li> Work greats. I&#x27;ve noticed a mass improvement in the growth of my nails. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to check my hair as yet because i have braids in. But i have noticed a lot of new growth since drinking the tea. will definitely be placing another order.  UPDATE:  This is my 6th time buying. These definitely work. My hair and nails look stronger and healthier. I have every woman in my family drinking this tea. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed! Love this tea &amp; the customer service is excellent! Thank you!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Okay so when I graduated from college, I started to shed hair excessively and I was extremely worried. I went to the doctor, who told me that I had to just wait until my current hair cycle is over, which could take up to three months. Feeling frustrated and anxious, I desperately sought to take the matter into my own hands. That&#x27;s when I found out about the benefits of silica. Through some more research, I found that bamboo is the richest source of the mineral, which led me to purchasing this bamboo tea. I actually ended up seeing results immediately-within the first few days, my hair problem was solved. And not only that, but since I&#x27;ve been drinking it (I drink 1-3 cups a day with the same bag), my hair has grown crazy fast, and it feels smoother and softer than ever. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good tea, I just started using it. I believe that it will work.</li>
            <li> i love it, i can see some differences along with bamboo hair and nails vits. but i will not buy the tea again instead ill buy the bamboo powder pills it will make my life easier than having the tea bag into warm water and forget to drink it.</li>
            <li> I love love this tea!!! but it can get little pricey after a while especially when you buy other vitamins that you take for yourself. i want to try the bamboo vitamins but it&#x27;s  $16.00 and $4or5 in shipment  and I think at least for loyal customers should have free shipment or a combo pack tea &amp; vitamins something like two for $25 or two for $30  please i love it!! :) thanks  advance; )</li>
            <li> Only had for a few days.. Taste is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I drink this tea religiously everyday and I really see a difference in my hair and nails! I love this tea!</li>
            <li> Ok I purchased this tea 2 months and I must say I&#x27;m amazed at the length of my hair, the weight lost I was 185lb I&#x27;m now 179lb also my skin isn&#x27;t tired looking, I&#x27;m not kidding,... I was skeptical at first but wow!! Yes you have to get use to the taste, but who cares I feel great!</li>
            <li> Notice a difference in my hair. Tea is not all that tasty but when I added a little bot of lemon and honey to the tea it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The sellers of this tea are very professional which I greatly appreciate! I finished my 30 day supply of tea and I definitely can tell the difference with my hair. The tea does smell like grass but the taste is very pleasant and I drink it unsweetened.  I loved it so much that I ordered another supply. I will definitely continue drinking this tea regularly!</li>
            <li> Been almost a month and I&#x27;ve gotten 1 1/2 inches of hair growth, my nails are a lot stronger and growing really fast.</li>
            <li> Well to be totally honest it smells like dog food to me and I have to put sugar in mine but if it will make my hair grow then it&#x27;s all good(lol)</li>
            <li> Earthy taste.... I like strong tasting tea and this was a powerful tea will repurchase...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TASTE BUT HAVENT YET SEEN ANY RESULT YET I WAS DISAPPOINTED NEED MY HAIR TO GROW AS IT SAY BUT IT IS GREAT TEA LOVE IT BUT MY HAIR HAVENT GROW OR SEE ANY DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> I did not like the test</li>
            <li> I have received my bamboo tea much sooner than expected. I have really enjoyed the tase it&#x27;s mild on the first day of drinking this tea I could feel it working .I started to feel better inside can&#x27;t explain it but, it work&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I drink it without any sugar. You get accustomed to the taste. When drinking this tea also drink plenty of water or else it Makes your urine very yellow</li>
            <li> Love this tea! The taste isn&#x27;t strong to me at all I just gulp it down and be on my way. I make sure to drink it twice a day, morning and night and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results. Delivered in 4 days and came with a cute message from the company! Thank you Beautifully Bamboo I love my tea!</li>
            <li> I drink the tea and take the beautifully bamboo vitamins it works really great together I would definitely recommend it. Happy hair journey ladies!!😃😃</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Terra, and I love this tea. At first I started off sweetening it with raw honey, then one night I decided that I would just drink it without sweetening it. The true taste of the bamboo is so good to me and also makes me feel good knowing that I&#x27;m getting just the natural bamboo in my system. My hair is growing fast and I keep my hands in water. Before I started drinking this bamboo tea my nails would break daily, now they are growing and are so strong I haven&#x27;t broken not one nail this is so true. So I encourage everyone to buy this tea it have so many benefits, too many to list.</li>
            <li> Very mild taste. I like this a lot.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality Bamboo tea!!! After I finished the package, I bought another cheaper brand Organic bamboo tea and didn&#x27;t see the great results that I had with this one (a lot less acne breakout, hair growth, etc.).  What a wonderful seller: They included some excellent written instructiona with my purchase.  I took their advice and after steeping the bag for one cup, I used it immediately to again make another, just as potent, cup.  The brand I bought after this one I couldn&#x27;t use the same bag twice, and I felt the first cup was not as potent a quality as this one.  I would buy this again, I just wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Tastes great!</li>
            <li> flavor was very bland and mild, drank at night before bed</li>
            <li> This tea is wonderful, it has a very strong earthy taste.  Also within two weeks of drinking the tea I noticed a huge difference in my hair and nails. They both grew and felt stronger. I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff i highly recommend this to everyone for great strong and healthy hair skin and nails!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping of the tea was g-r-e-a-t!  It came less than a week after ordering. I believe I ordered it on Monday evening and received it Wednesday.  As soon as I opened the bag, I boiled my water.  It&#x27;s good!  I expected it to be bland like green tea. It wasn&#x27;t! It has a distinct flavor that sets it apart from all other teas including green and black tea. I am certainly going to drink a cup a day and see how it goes. Even if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair or nails, I am going to keep buying it just for the flavor. I am an advert tea drinker as I do not like coffee. I had two cups yesterday and had one today.  &amp;#34;I think I will enjoy a spot of delicious bamboo tea before bed&amp;#34;. (In my fake English accent).</li>
            <li> Beautifully smooth taste! So much nicer than green tea. I am now addicted to this tea. Dealing with the supplier was a pleasure too. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this tea.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tea and I will purchase 2 bags every-time I run out. It taste great and no sticks has a beautiful color and very aromatic. I am a faith bamboo drinker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! one of my new favorite teas!</li>
            <li> i love the taste w/ honey !! I drink it in the am and pm.. drinking for almost a month now. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  A friend recommended this tea to me, after I saw the results on him; I decided to ordered some and tried it out. I would always have it and use it every day.  I would recommended this tea to any one who would love to have good skin, nails, and hair.  Love the taste!!  I enjoy taking it to work and have it at home.  The product came to me quick and on time. Great service!</li>
            <li> TOO BITTER AND VERY PUNGANT</li>
            <li> Soothing relaxing at bed time with honey really help in the hair growing department</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li> The product has a smooth taste. It is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my hair soft and long. I lost 15 pounds. I will order more this month. Bamboo is the best!!</li>
            <li> I like this tea it is a nice tasting tea I mix two Tablespoon Of Honey with it I drink two cup&#x27;s a day it really does work</li>
            <li> Bamboo Tea is the bomb.com! a must have tea. I have been drinking Bamboo Tea since Feb 2014, from June 2013 at APL to know Sept 2014 I&#x27;m a little pass WL, I love this tea my Mother drinks it and some of my friends also and  have seen hair growth. I seen one of the ladies the other day in the store who I told about Bamboo Tea OMG! her hair has grown so much she said I have to drink my tea everyday. Bamboo Tea taste so good I do not put any sugar or honey in it, it has a smooth taste and you can drink it hot or cold 2 cups a day. Ladies if you want hair growth long nails and clear skin Bamboo Tea it a must have.</li>
            <li> I love the tea it&#x27;s so refreshing</li>
            <li> Product works very well for hair and nail growth.... Will be purchasing another bach of this tea</li>
            <li> Love the tea so far thank you :-*</li>
            <li> Love the tea. I&#x27;m  a tea drinker and will be purchasing  more very soon. Nails I can see the difference, hair and skin never had any complaints. Overall its worth trying and besides real tea is good for  you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tea last month. I decided to drink it at least twice a day, re-using the tea bag. It has a light, pleasant grassy taste and I drank it without adding honey or any kind of sweetener.  After the third day I was amazed to discover that I did not feel the usual soreness after a gym workout.  I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s the effect of collagen? Anyway, I just ordered my second bag of bamboo tea. I&#x27;m hoping to see positive changes in my hair growth and in my skin and nails too.</li>
            <li> I feel as though my body and the tea are one. It&#x27;s repairing me as I rest at night. Which is when I drink my tea... Just before bed. Natural tea for natural me.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this tea again real soon!</li>
            <li> This tea taste just like it smells earthly. ..but I love the taste it&#x27;s smooth and very relaxing. ..I am not sure about hair growth yet.  I do know that this is my favorite tea thus far</li>
            <li> This tea was not at all like the tasty organic bamboo tea that I fell in love with a while ago. Im definitely gonna order from [...] from now on because theyre tea is delicious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an interesting flavor and aroma. It kind of reminds me of potato chips - (pringles to be exact lol) but nonetheless it&#x27;s good. I have yet to try it with some honey. Can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised by the light and refreshing taste of this tea. Was a little skeptical at first due to the bold, earthy aroma that first hits you upon opening the package; however, once brewed, it settles quite nicely. Did not have to add any extra dress ups; this tea was very delicious in its own natural state. A definite winner!! I&#x27;ve already purchased my second package.</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  It has a mild flavor and no caffeine.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this tea, it&#x27;s my 2nd order and it works well and tastes good. To give it a little kick, I squeeze a tiny bit of lemon juice and honey and it&#x27;s so good! If you&#x27;re apprehensive about purchasing, don&#x27;t be! I have to go to the nail shop every other week instead of once a month and I have a bit of new growth which is coming in nice &amp; thick by the way! Order some tea you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> Now i never tried this tea yet but i love how the shipment came neat and fast if product work successfully i will be purchasing this tea from this user again</li>
            <li> Not yet thirty days but nails are stronger. Hair seems fuller. Will continue to get maximum results. I drink it cold with stevia and sometimes lemon or lime</li>
            <li> I like the Bamboo tea, has a very nice taste.</li>
            <li> We will see some results soon....love the taste with a little cream.  Get customer service.  Thanks again</li>
            <li> Great tasting tea. I didn&#x27;t have to add anything</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any hair growth. Or anything with my nails but overall the tea taste ok</li>
            <li> These came individually wrapped tea bags - I love it.  I thought it was loose tea, was prepared for either but very happy that they&#x27;re individually wrapped tea bags.  The tea has a light taste, I have it every morning - will purchase again.  Arrived early! :)</li>
            <li> Just had my first cup and I love the light taste. Some added sugar; I didn&#x27;t and mine was fine. But I did add some goji berries and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  I drink a cup every night before bed, and it relaxes me.  It is doing wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> O meh gawd it smells and tastes soooo good. I got the tea an d pills yesterday and the tea is so yummy! I will update when I see changes in my hair length</li>
            <li> I bought this tea to help with my hair, skin and nails and got an added bonus!  i really believe this tea helped to dissolve an abscess that developed under my skin.  I had been in pain for more than a week when i started having a cup of this daily.  within 5days the abscess was gone!  this tea will always be on my shelf for this day on!</li>
            <li> Customer service was amazing , this tea taste really good. I enjoy a cup day and night &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of this wonderful tea.  As a green tea lover I enjoy this tea as much.  It has a slighly nutty flavor.  My hair and nails love this!!!</li>
            <li> Flavorful, enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  If I&#x27;m not mistaken the tea has kept my stomach from being bloated.  My co-workers noticed the difference.  I got them interested in purchasing the tea, also my daughter has purchased it.  As far as helping with hair growth the verdict is still out. But I have faith :-))</li>
            <li> Love this tea it really works , it doesn&#x27;t have a taste but it works wonders</li>
            <li> Tea was a nice smooth taste, definitely a keeper will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the bamboo tea, I saw results within the second week. Not only is the tea lite, but I feel very relaxed while I sip it. For me this is an added bonus!!! I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> So far so good..it&#x27;s working well for me..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff...my nails are strong and grow fast. Not so sure about my hair but I have to pluck the eyebrows more when I&#x27;m drinking this.  I usually just throw a tea bag into my water bottle and go. The taste isn&#x27;t all that great but a bit of honey takes care of that.  I did try a cheaper brand and did not see the same results as with this one.</li>
            <li> This tea is amazing. The first week I started to use it I saw results on my sleep patterns. Slowly my skin glowed like crazy and I even converted my mum and dad (they have only been using for 6 weeks or so and the results on their skin tone and sleep patterns are amazing). Regarding my hair in the last 8 weeks they grew at least 40% more than usual and they are thicker. Now its time to convert the brother. My mum and I agreed that this will be our beauty secret and honestly when people ask her what new cream is she using she is like nothing. I know its bad but we do not wish to share this magical secret. :-). I&#x27;m curious to see if the amazing changes that we see will keep evolving or have we already reached all the benefits effect of the tea?</li>
            <li> This tea is great, and was a good purchase for me.  I was pleasantly surprised by its mild flavor, which allows me to drink it without sugar.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the benefits others have experienced including longer, stronger hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve noticed changes in my hair it&#x27;s healthier., reduced shedding and my nails are stronger . They normally break easily but now there&#x27;s a huge difference. I take it in conjunction with the hair skin nails pill. The tasty is okay not amazing - but not bad. My trick is two make my two cups a day before n chill in the fridge (I place both 8oz cups into a blender both , as it has the ozs on the side) I don&#x27;t add anything to it . Taste better cold :) will be order a 3 month supply soon . Also my knee pain has decreased dramatically</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tea and has a very pleasant taste.  I normally drink my tea as is and don&#x27;t add anything extra to it.  I have been drinking it for the past 30 days and have noticed difference in my hair and nail growth.  My new growth seems to grow much faster and my nails are very strong and have grown very long as well.  If you&#x27;re not use to drinking your tea plain then the taste my take a little bit use to, but when you get pass the earthy taste then you&#x27;re good to go.  Highly recommended and it&#x27;s loaded with good nutrients that is a must to incorporate into your beauty regimen inside out.</li>
            <li> Have my tea EVERY NIGHT!</li>
            <li> I have been drinking this tea for about a month and have grown to love it more than the regular tea that I used to drink daily. Initially, I was hesitant because I didnt like the smell which is kind of earthy; but, once I got over the smell, I was able to focus on the taste which is nice and mild. I love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and you get use to flavor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s giving my face a nice noticeable glow! I love the taste of the tea too!</li>
