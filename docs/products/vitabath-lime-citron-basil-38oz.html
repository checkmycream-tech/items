            <li>(So I have learned to hide it, LOL).</li>

            <li>Also makes a great bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Great in the bath and shower.</li>
            <li>It is GREAT as a laundry soap.  </li>
            <li>This shower gel is amazing!</li>
            <li>VitaBath products are really great for moisturizing your skin and also provide surprising value, despite the price.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>The price for this item was good</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and good feeling.....</li>
            <li>Pump works well, good price, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>The shower gel is great, very clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice anything amazing after using this</li>
            <li>Great pine scent that my wife and I both enjoy.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I have used before and really liked.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon and quickly bought two.  </li>
            <li>I tried this in a vacation home in San Diego and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I was glad that the Vitabath was in a sealed plastic bag, because the product leaked and the pump was cracked.</li>
            <li>Love, love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>We love the Vitabath line and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I remembered it .....</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the job that it does.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>the lather is so rich and feels so amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>BUT this is the first time I ever received an item from Amazon that didn&#x27;t arrive in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The third use - one full pump was perfect...</li>
            <li>If you like a nice fresh smell, I think you would like this product.</li>
            <li>This product has a refreshing, clean smell.</li>
            <li>For sulfate &amp; paraben free product, this is a great value, I used to spend more money for much smaller amount of shower gel at stores.</li>
            <li>I have always used Vitabath and it was ok to unscrew the lid to pour in the tub, but this great new scent in the pump bottle makes showers so much easier!</li>
            <li>Its huge.</li>
            <li>But tis phosphate free.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the Vitabath products (worth 5 stars).</li>
            <li>The true lime scent is wonderfully fresh and clean, suitable for anyone - even the men in my house like it.</li>
            <li>Environmentally friendly in the water.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Formulated with quality ingredients, the rich lather makes for an invigorating spa like shower or a luxurious bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, smooth, and amazingly refreshed.</li>
            <li>I like the aroma of Vitabath Lime Citron Basil as well as how Refreshed &amp; clean</li>
            <li>All of these things are GREAT for your skin (though I am not sure of the efficacy of mixing them all together nor am I sure of the efficacy of rinsing them off your skin or pairing them with cleansers that could degrade the ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium olefin sulfonate is the ingredient in question.</li>
            <li>Bubbles up and makes the entire bathroom smell as good as you do.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually sooooo good</li>
            <li>, I have been stalking the manufacturer&#x27;s web site ever since, hoping for this to become available again - and it is, right now.</li>
            <li>I feel super when I get out of the bath.</li>
            <li>The Spring Fresh leaves your skin with a strong scent at first that subsides throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Vitabath for years and this is just as incredible as their other products, all high quality.</li>
            <li>I love this kind of fresh green leafy scent.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money i say.</li>
            <li>It removes the smell and build up of chlorine after swimming pool leaving skin fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean and your skins feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn about re-ordering this or going back to the Spring Fresh (which has a strong botanical scent - more like leaves, grass, and pine, not so much flowers).  </li>
            <li>First, the scent is unbelievable - you will definitely love the lime, citron, &amp; basil scents (if you are a lime, citron, &amp; basil kind of person).</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of Vitabath soup.</li>
            <li>My first use, I pumped 3 times onto my  shower puff...</li>
            <li>Really like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Some friends had the same problem and they, too love this gel.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first found it at Costco</li>
            <li>I have used the regular Vitabth products for many years.</li>
            <li>I first found [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I loved this product and bought quite a few in January 2012 for $12.</li>
            <li>Their soap and skin lotions are also great, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Although I like the original scent of the Badidas, I like the Lime Citron Basil nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Plus, this shower gel is harsh chemical SULFATE &amp; PARABEN FREE, what can we ask more??  </li>
            <li>Most soaps/gels leave my skin dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that there are no sulfates in it that can dry out your skin</li>
            <li>The product is pictured with a hand pump dispenser and you really need it since it is such a large bottle, but it does not come with a pump!!!  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is really pleasing and calming to me.</li>
            <li>too much - didn&#x27;t need 3 pumps.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much to get bubbles.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>at Costco last year, and have been beating myself up ever since for not going right back and getting more before they stopped carrying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>and most of the bath products goes down the drain??....</li>
            <li>At $19.00 for the exact same 38oz bottle, with free standard shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li>Its still the high quality it has always been......Would recommend....</li>
            <li>would not pay the high asking price now, but if I found it again at the Costco clearance price, I would buy a case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a lady with very, very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Lime Citron Basil scent is a nice change from the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; VitaBath scents, not nearly as strong... but definitely a pleasing lime-basil you will recognize.  </li>
            <li>Second, this shower gel has such a rich lather.</li>
            <li>Bought it at Costco last year for the first time and they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>But I cannot fit in the sink so down the drain it went.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 2 bottles and I am going to purchase at least 4 more before they sell out or discontinue this product.</li>
            <li>All of their products leaves skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say go there and buy it directly from them.  </li>
            <li>The package was full of product which, instead of rinsing down the drain I wanted to bathe in.  </li>
            <li>First off I must say how disappointed I am that Vitabath is so concerned with making sure their FULL ingredients list is nowhere to be found on the internet.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very concentrated, so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I do not recommend Vitabath Moisturizing Body Wash and because of their obvious dislike of posting their ingredients I will not be trying any of their other products until they post them in full.</li>
            <li>I got only one new cyst.</li>
            <li>I got only one new cyst.</li>
            <li>The second use, same thing... too much - didn&#x27;t need 2 pumps.</li>
            <li>while NOT a straight out lie, it is certainly deceiving and they don&#x27;t want people to see the sketchy ingredients before they purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;HERE are the full ingredients (for the green apple and white lily scent)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside to the scent, however, is because it is more subtle, it also doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; effect that the traditional VitaBath products provide.  </li>
            <li>A small amount (one pump or about a tablespoon) into a bath poof with last an entire shower and produces voluminous rich lather.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing is expensive. But tis phosphate free. Environmentally friendly in the water. Its huge. the fragrance is really pleasing and calming to me. I tried this in a vacation home in San Diego and fell in love. Worth the money i say.</li>
            <li> This product has a refreshing, clean smell. I would purchase this again.This was my first purchase of Vitabath soup.Excellent liquid soup.</li>
            <li> This shower gel is amazing! I&#x27;ve used Vitabath products in the past so the expectation was there for a quality product - I was not disappointed. First, the scent is unbelievable - you will definitely love the lime, citron, &amp; basil scents (if you are a lime, citron, &amp; basil kind of person). Second, this shower gel has such a rich lather. My first use, I pumped 3 times onto my  shower puff... too much - didn&#x27;t need 3 pumps. The second use, same thing... too much - didn&#x27;t need 2 pumps. The third use - one full pump was perfect... the lather is so rich and feels so amazing on my skin. And the scent... I just can&#x27;t say enough about the scent... you will want to shower 3 or 4 times a day just to experience the scent that this gel leaves on your body or the way that it &#x27;smells up&#x27; the entire bathroom and adjacent rooms.  I am also blown away by the size of the bottle and the bargain of a price... I purchased 2 bottles and I am going to purchase at least 4 more before they sell out or discontinue this product. I&#x27;m HOOKED!</li>
            <li> This shower gel is awesome.It removes the smell and build up of chlorine after swimming pool leaving skin fresh and hydrated. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and think this is one of the best shower gels out there. It smells wonderful but the smell goes away once you are done showering which I like, because it doesn&#x27;t bother my newborn and it doesn&#x27;t mess with the perfume when I use one.</li>
            <li> Vitabath Lime Citron Basil Shower Gel has a great scent.  It creates a relaxing, foamy shower experience.  Reminds me of the tropics.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  It smells so fresh and clean and your skins feels soft and smooth.  I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at Costco and my girlfriend and I absolutely loved it.  We were sad when Costco stopped carrying it but to my surprise, I found it available from Amazon with Prime shipping.  I bought 2 bottles of VitaBath at $15.49 each.  Now that our supply need refilling, I check and the price shot up to $27.99???  Not worth it at that price.  What the heck happened in the past 3 months?</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitabath for years and this is just as incredible as their other products, all high quality. The true lime scent is wonderfully fresh and clean, suitable for anyone - even the men in my house like it. (So I have learned to hide it, LOL). Formulated with quality ingredients, the rich lather makes for an invigorating spa like shower or a luxurious bubble bath. Leaves skin soft, smooth, and amazingly refreshed.</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff.  Smells like lime and heaven.</li>
            <li> Really like the fresh smell. Bought it at Costco last year for the first time and they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shower gel.  It&#x27;s the freshest smelling product I have found in years.  Bubbles up and makes the entire bathroom smell as good as you do.    Great gift!</li>
            <li> VitaBath products are really great for moisturizing your skin and also provide surprising value, despite the price.  A small amount (one pump or about a tablespoon) into a bath poof with last an entire shower and produces voluminous rich lather.  The Lime Citron Basil scent is a nice change from the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; VitaBath scents, not nearly as strong... but definitely a pleasing lime-basil you will recognize.  The only downside to the scent, however, is because it is more subtle, it also doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; effect that the traditional VitaBath products provide.  I&#x27;m torn about re-ordering this or going back to the Spring Fresh (which has a strong botanical scent - more like leaves, grass, and pine, not so much flowers).  The Spring Fresh leaves your skin with a strong scent at first that subsides throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m a big believer in VitaBath products!</li>
            <li> The price for this item was good BUT this is the first time I ever received an item from Amazon that didn&#x27;t arrive in good condition.  I was glad that the Vitabath was in a sealed plastic bag, because the product leaked and the pump was cracked. I had to transfer the gel to a smaller bottle because of the pump. I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that (that&#x27;s why I gave it only 3 stars).  Otherwise I love the Vitabath products (worth 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Most soaps/gels leave my skin dry and itchy. The Vitabath gel does not. It does not cause the &#x27;itch&#x27; reaction I was used to. Some friends had the same problem and they, too love this gel.</li>
            <li> Pump works well, good price, and smells nice. I don&#x27;t notice anything amazing after using this but I don&#x27;t notice anything bad either.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma of Vitabath Lime Citron Basil as well as how Refreshed &amp; clean my skin feels after bathing</li>
            <li> I loved this product and bought quite a few in January 2012 for $12. I needed a refill and to my horror the price has changed to $30. It&#x27;s so not worth it at such an exorbitant price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, fragrant bubble bath. You don&#x27;t need to use much to get bubbles. So it lasts a long time. It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using Vitabath for over 40 years. I feel super when I get out of the bath.Also makes a great bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Love, love love this stuff.  It is the best body wash I have ever used.  I first found it at Costco but then they ran out and I couldn&#x27;t get it there anymore.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and quickly bought two.  They arrived on time but were leaking even though the seller had taped down the lids with tape.  The package was full of product which, instead of rinsing down the drain I wanted to bathe in.  But I cannot fit in the sink so down the drain it went.  I am still thankful to have found this product but will look for another vendor next time.  It&#x27;s actually sooooo good it could change your mornings from dull to divine in just one use - try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> First off I must say how disappointed I am that Vitabath is so concerned with making sure their FULL ingredients list is nowhere to be found on the internet. But now I know why. It&#x27;s because their \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; claim is while NOT a straight out lie, it is certainly deceiving and they don&#x27;t want people to see the sketchy ingredients before they purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not a chemistry or skincare expert. I&#x27;m just a lady with very, very, very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had to learn to research every single thing I put on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE are the full ingredients (for the green apple and white lily scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water, sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate, cocamidoproyl betaine, cocamide MEA, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, fragrance, glycerin, retinyl palmitate, niacinamide, panthenol, ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, centaurea cyanus flower extract, euterpe oleracea fruit extract, garcinia mangostana fruit extract, lycium barbarum fruit extract, morinda fruit extrtact, punica granatum  extract, coffee extract, safflower seed oil, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed wheat starch, polyquaternium-10, polyquaternium-7, benzophenone-4, sodium chloride, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol, blue 1, yellow 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see vitabath contains a number of great ingredients! vitamin b, vitamin c (though it is undoubtedly ineffective unless this soap was made less than a week ago), vitamin e, even vitamin a, coffee/caffeine, and green tea! All of these things are GREAT for your skin (though I am not sure of the efficacy of mixing them all together nor am I sure of the efficacy of rinsing them off your skin or pairing them with cleansers that could degrade the ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium olefin sulfonate is the ingredient in question. It is derived from sulfonic acid rather than sulfuric acid. that is why as I said before their \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; claim is technically not complete lie. However, it all comes from sulfur, it does exactly the same thing as other harsh detergents/surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate and in some cases can be HARSHER, leaving you with dry, pimply, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains other harsh detergents like coco derivatives and disodium laureth sulfosuccinate which is not a sulfate because the sulfuric acid is replaced with a negatively charged ion (I think. I&#x27;m not an expert).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product so I did use the entire bottle. My bacne got moderately worse with small pimples mostly on my upper arms and shoulders. I got only one new cyst. I did not risk it on my face because I am perioral dermatitis prone. It did not work for shaving and left my legs with itchy itchy bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do not recommend Vitabath Moisturizing Body Wash and because of their obvious dislike of posting their ingredients I will not be trying any of their other products until they post them in full.harsh detergents/surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate and in some cases can be HARSHER, leaving you with dry, pimply, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains other harsh detergents like coco derivatives and disodium laureth sulfosuccinate which is not a sulfate because the sulfuric acid is replaced with a negatively charged ion (I think.

            <li> Only complaint is that the cap practically welds itself shut every time I close it.  Try it out, you will smell great!</li>
            <li> The shower gel is great, very clean scent.  The product is pictured with a hand pump dispenser and you really need it since it is such a large bottle, but it does not come with a pump!!!  When I&#x27;ve seen this product in stores it always has the pump dispenser so not sure why it doesn&#x27;t come with one, but this needs to be changed!!</li>
            <li> This bath soap smells great! I also love the fact that there are no sulfates in it that can dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I have always used Vitabath and it was ok to unscrew the lid to pour in the tub, but this great new scent in the pump bottle makes showers so much easier!</li>
            <li> Great pine scent that my wife and I both enjoy.  This stuff is very concentrated, so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> All of their products leaves skin soft to the touch. I have been using their products for years. Their soap and skin lotions are also great, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby after trying the Beach Blossom scent, which was a little to feminine for him and over powering for me.  We ended up with this scent, which works for both of us.  We love the Vitabath line and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this kind of fresh green leafy scent.  I was getting sick of artificial floral scent that most kinds of shower gel have, so I&#x27;m glad to find this one. (If you like those floral scent, you may not like this one though.)  Plus, this shower gel is harsh chemical SULFATE &amp; PARABEN FREE, what can we ask more??  For sulfate &amp; paraben free product, this is a great value, I used to spend more money for much smaller amount of shower gel at stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of bath products....Mostly-now-a-days they all seem to be a runny water consistancy....and most of the bath products goes down the drain??....This is an oldie but a goodie....I&#x27;m so glad I remembered it .....Now it is all I will use on my delicate skin....Moisturizing and good feeling.....Thank you Vitabath for never changing your formula!!...Its still the high quality it has always been......Would recommend....</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used before and really liked.  It has no objectionable additives like paraben or sulfates.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular Vitabth products for many years. It is not inexpensive, but I feel this is a small luxury that I give myself. I love the scent and the job that it does. Although I like the original scent of the Badidas, I like the Lime Citron Basil nearly as well. If you like a nice fresh smell, I think you would like this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.  I thought the combination sounded really strange but got it when it was marked down at Costco.  (Now they don&#x27;t carry it).  And it smells wonderful!  And it leaves my skin so soft!  Great in the bath and shower.</li>
            <li> I first found [[ASIN:B0055STYHC Vitabath Lime Citron Basil Shower Gel 38 Oz]] at Costco last year, and have been beating myself up ever since for not going right back and getting more before they stopped carrying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been stalking the manufacturer&#x27;s web site ever since, hoping for this to become available again - and it is, right now. At $19.00 for the exact same 38oz bottle, with free standard shipping. And I got an extra 15% off with the INFLUENSTER25 coupon code, as well. I&#x27;d say go there and buy it directly from them.  I just ordered a half a dozen bottles (yep, I&#x27;m that crazy about this fragrance), and it all came to ~$80-something with that extra 15% off.</li>
            <li> Excellent service!! I&#x27;ll buy again from this vendor.  Once I submitted the order I received an e mail confirming that my merchandise will be arriving in two days.  They did what they promised. Good service!</li>
            <li> I did NOT like this product at all as a shower gel!  But, since the price was right--under ten, I repurposed it instead of returning it to Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use the last of liquid soaps and even bubble bath to do my delicate laundry.  So, this was redirected to the laundry room because I could not tollerate it in the shower. It is GREAT as a laundry soap.  Only two or three pumps are needed per load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not pay the high asking price now, but if I found it again at the Costco clearance price, I would buy a case.</li>
