            <li>All of the things I associated with argan oil that I thought just didn&#x27;t work for me aren&#x27;t true of this product.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I am a huge advocate of natural living.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I can see a huge difference in my hands!</li>
            <li>I am big fan of argan oil and just love what a couple of drops does to my skin.</li>
            <li>My feet have become soft and smooth..  </li>
            <li>It makes it feel unbelieveably soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also add a drop to my moisturizer to keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>You get a large bottle of 2 ounces with an eye dropper lid.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found pure Argan oil to work just as well.</li>
            <li>B00GS4Z7LO Pure Argan Oil - Organic Moroccan Argan Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Swiss Botanys  Argan Oil is 100% Pure and Organic.</li>
            <li>It is unscented, lightweight &amp; pure.</li>
            <li>I really dont like being petted like a dog</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The quality really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>we started with his hands,we used it day and night for 5 days..and his hands have improved so much.</li>
            <li>This product really works and I will buy it again</li>
            <li>I also use it straight up as a cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>It has really changed my routine in the morning.</li>
            <li>As a cosmetology, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very &#x27;absorbable&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Very please with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>so this really helps during winter season.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any and everyone!</li>
            <li>- Intensely Nourishes and Soothes, for Skin, Nails and Hair.</li>
            <li>It was very soothing and helped heal the eczema patches on my face and scalp.</li>
            <li>B00GS4Z7LO Argan Oil - Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil - Intensely Nourishes and Soothes, for Skin, Nails and Hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shine so much even after all the treatments I have had on it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my elbows which were still rough even after using good lotion daily.</li>
            <li>It took me ages to find a version of this oil that had decent reviews and was really pure and organic.</li>
            <li>It takes very little to get amazing results.</li>
            <li>The change from warm weather to cold weather always does my skin in and this has really helped make things better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement to my insanely dry skin in those areas.</li>
            <li>Not only does Swiss Botany have a much much better price point, you get a larger bottle!  </li>
            <li>They were starting to look kind of old and dry, but now they are shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and silky and I use it on my face (mixed with pomegranate oil) every day and my complexion is noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li>The argan oil made my elbows soft after just one days use!</li>
            <li>I love argan oil and this one is comparable to the pricier name brands that I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair, 1 drop is enough.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I have used it for 3 weeks now a few drops rubbed into my scalp has eliminated my dry scalp issue.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure triple extra virgin argan oil</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their physical appearance with a natural, organic product.</li>
            <li>cause she likes how soft my hair has gotten so its a gift and a curse</li>
            <li>but this can serve as a hair styler if applied modestly.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair and skin feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that because argan oil is natural, it doesn&#x27;t trigger any reactions from my normally moderately sensitive face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is drunk off of this stuff in the good way</li>
            <li>If you put in hari make sure you use a very small amount.</li>
            <li>A dime sized amount was way too much for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops into my lotion bar mix right after I remove the mixture from heat which helps tremendously (in combination with the other ingredients) for my eczema which flares in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have used it on the dry ends of my hair and it has really improved the look</li>
            <li>Mixed with my shampoo and made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Has kept my hair soft for days after several washings.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didnâ€™t really have any bad experiences with any argan oils</li>
            <li>I find that my hair is less frizzy, my ends are less dry, and my hair has much more shine when I use Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I use it exactly right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several argan oil products over the past 2 years, but have not been able to continue due to the heavy and/or thick quality and added potent fragrances (especially the most-expensive and most-popular versions!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I can see a huge difference in my hands!</li>
            <li> I am big fan of argan oil and just love what a couple of drops does to my skin.</li>

            <li> You get a large bottle of 2 ounces with an eye dropper lid.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found pure Argan oil to work just as well.</li>
            <li> B00GS4Z7LO Pure Argan Oil - Organic Moroccan Argan Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Swiss Botanys  Argan Oil is 100% Pure and Organic.</li>
            <li> It is unscented, lightweight &amp; pure.</li>
            <li> I really dont like being petted like a dog</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The quality really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> This product really works and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I also use it straight up as a cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> It has really changed my routine in the morning.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetology, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very &#x27;absorbable&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very please with this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> so this really helps during winter season.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any and everyone!</li>
            <li> - Intensely Nourishes and Soothes, for Skin, Nails and Hair.</li>
            <li> It was very soothing and helped heal the eczema patches on my face and scalp.</li>
            <li> B00GS4Z7LO Argan Oil - Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil - Intensely Nourishes and Soothes, for Skin, Nails and Hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shine so much even after all the treatments I have had on it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my elbows which were still rough even after using good lotion daily.</li>
            <li> It took me ages to find a version of this oil that had decent reviews and was really pure and organic.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to get amazing results.</li>
            <li> The change from warm weather to cold weather always does my skin in and this has really helped make things better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement to my insanely dry skin in those areas.</li>
            <li> Not only does Swiss Botany have a much much better price point, you get a larger bottle!  </li>
            <li> They were starting to look kind of old and dry, but now they are shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and silky and I use it on my face (mixed with pomegranate oil) every day and my complexion is noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> The argan oil made my elbows soft after just one days use!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and this one is comparable to the pricier name brands that I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair, 1 drop is enough.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I have used it for 3 weeks now a few drops rubbed into my scalp has eliminated my dry scalp issue.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure triple extra virgin argan oil</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their physical appearance with a natural, organic product.</li>
            <li> cause she likes how soft my hair has gotten so its a gift and a curse</li>
            <li> but this can serve as a hair styler if applied modestly.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair and skin feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that because argan oil is natural, it doesn&#x27;t trigger any reactions from my normally moderately sensitive face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is drunk off of this stuff in the good way</li>
            <li> If you put in hari make sure you use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> A dime sized amount was way too much for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops into my lotion bar mix right after I remove the mixture from heat which helps tremendously (in combination with the other ingredients) for my eczema which flares in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have used it on the dry ends of my hair and it has really improved the look</li>
            <li> Mixed with my shampoo and made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Has kept my hair soft for days after several washings.</li>
            <li> Honestly I didnâ€™t really have any bad experiences with any argan oils</li>
            <li> I find that my hair is less frizzy, my ends are less dry, and my hair has much more shine when I use Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I use it exactly right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several argan oil products over the past 2 years, but have not been able to continue due to the heavy and/or thick quality and added potent fragrances (especially the most-expensive and most-popular versions!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sed Argan oil before but not sure if they were 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially when the weather changes and this has definitely made my skin softer.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also applying a little to my nails and so far I&#x27;m liking the results!</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this for my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I especially like it for the soles of my feet that often get  dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really frizzy, hard to manage hair with tons of flyaways.  </li>
            <li> My dry spots have cleared up, and I feel replenished.</li>
            <li> During the winter my feet and my elbows become so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hand are so cracked and dry</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my hair, my face, dry patches of my skin, and for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, hair and nails</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> like massaging a drop of Argan Oil into my damp hair before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with removing dark spots on my face and back.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found the Pure Argan Oil to make things less painful this year!</li>
            <li> Bye bye dry!</li>
            <li> In the morning, my rough, dry feet saw a 50% improvement.  </li>
            <li> It is a such a quality product that it only takes a small amount to cover a lot of skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I started using it on my dry, damaged hair at a friend&#x27;s recommendation, and since then I&#x27;ve found a variety of other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are in heavy rotation in my household.</li>
            <li> Having had a foot injury recently, I spent quite alot of time with hydrogen peroxide soaks.  </li>
            <li> I found myself dealing with open wounds and extremely dried out skin.  </li>
            <li> After I get out of the shower I massage it in to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> SO DRY!!  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it for my face especially before wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it as an additive to some of my other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it with any other hair product for quality.</li>
            <li> I am one who always thinks &amp;#34; a small amount&amp;#34; is not enough.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels dry and irritated, I apply it everyday and the heels of my feet are smother then ever.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair, but just a drop or two is plenty), and to tame down the ends if they get frizzy between shampoos.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little so don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> but I personally prefer organic(no big reason) and cold pressed, unrefined.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my face astringent and have been applying it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my palm, rub my palms together and use as a leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face and hair .</li>
            <li> Over the winter, I like to massage a few drops of Argan Oil into the backs of my hands, as it provides</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to compare the Swiss Botany product to others as it&#x27;s really in a different league from other argan oils.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to mess with my hair, just brush, style and go!</li>
            <li> but my girlfriend has been doing alot of it lately</li>
            <li> This is expensive and I am holding out that this product will do what it says and help to fade my dark spots.</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong with argon oil.</li>
            <li> Using it makes you feel dirty.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with your purchase!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just have to say this is awsome after a shower. I use it on my hair after shampooing and it leaves my hair feeling like babies hair. I really dont like being petted like a dog but my girlfriend has been doing alot of it lately cause she likes how soft my hair has gotten so its a gift and a curse haha. Also I dont like wearing pomade or hair gel, moose etc to style my hair but this can serve as a hair styler if applied modestly.</li>
            <li> So far so good! It took me ages to find a version of this oil that had decent reviews and was really pure and organic. It has a nice neutral smell, and absorbs very quickly. It does not smell rancid or seem like olive oil or anything else unauthentic. Just put it on my face and hair and they both feel great. I will have to update the review after I have used the product longer but for now I have a great first impression and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I have used it for 3 weeks now a few drops rubbed into my scalp has eliminated my dry scalp issue. I also rub it over my neck and face at night and can certainly see the difference in the skin texture and soften of lines. I will be stocking up for sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing results already on my overly dry elbows! I&#x27;ve been waiting for the perfect product and now I have found it!</li>
            <li> My wife is using it now and she likes it. We could see improvement of her skin. I will be back to give further review after consumming the bottle</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve bought quite a bit of argan oils for myself and my family/friends. I am big fan of argan oil and just love what a couple of drops does to my skin. I usually use it for my face especially before wearing any makeup. This argan oil by swiss botany seems like good quality. Honestly I didnâ€™t really have any bad experiences with any argan oils but I personally prefer organic(no big reason) and cold pressed, unrefined. This bottle was a perfect fit for my taste!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge advocate of natural living. Essential oils are in heavy rotation in my household. I was introduced to Argon Oil by Josie Marons line but, OUCH, the price tag hurts. Not only does Swiss Botany have a much much better price point, you get a larger bottle!  It is near order less and is a great replacement for tons of product. i use it on my hands and feet at night and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement to my insanely dry skin in those areas. I also replaced my moisturizer with Argon Oil. I&#x27;ll run through the ends of my hair as a leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve applied to my babies bottom at night instead of diaper cream. My oldest daughter has ezcema and this is working wonders for her!</li>
            <li> Mixed with my shampoo and made my hair soft and manageable. Have to look up what else to use it for since it worked good in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel fabulous.. love it</li>
            <li> Love it. This stuff is just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>

            <li> great product, i use it every day</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome...I have used it on the dry ends of my hair and it has really improved the look</li>
            <li> This oil is great for so many things. Stretch marks, to restore hair that has been over processed! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several argan oil products over the past 2 years, but have not been able to continue due to the heavy and/or thick quality and added potent fragrances (especially the most-expensive and most-popular versions!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swiss Botany Argan Oil is clear and odorless and exquisite to use. It takes very little to get amazing results. All of the things I associated with argan oil that I thought just didn&#x27;t work for me aren&#x27;t true of this product. It&#x27;s also a great size for the price and delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to compare the Swiss Botany product to others as it&#x27;s really in a different league from other argan oils. The quality really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I started using this in my hair and skin. I have very long fine hair, 1 drop is enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super! It makes my hair super soft and silky and I use it on my face (mixed with pomegranate oil) every day and my complexion is noticeably brighter. Plus it smells fantastically fruity!</li>
            <li> Works great..... Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> My hair is drunk off of this stuff in the good way lol! What a difference!</li>
            <li> 100% pure for a good price.  I use this on my hands and feet to sooth the dryness. I also put a drop or two on my face before applying makeup. My daughters have very dry hair, and it is a great conditioner! GREAT PRODUCT!  Only wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I can see a huge difference in my hands! They were starting to look kind of old and dry, but now they are shiny and soft! I also put a few drops in my face astringent and have been applying it before I go to bed. My face is glowing and looks healthy now!</li>
            <li> What a great product! Makes my hair feel absolutely wonderful and I think myself personally it&#x27;s helping for growth! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Every day I wear it. Within a week I had two compliments on my skin. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell</li>
            <li> Felt it helped give my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li> High quality organic product at an great low Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Having had a foot injury recently, I spent quite alot of time with hydrogen peroxide soaks.  I found myself dealing with open wounds and extremely dried out skin.  After 2 weeks of healing, I decided to use the Argan Oil hoping to see some improvement.  I rubbed both feet with the Argan Oil, put on a pair of socks and went to bed.  In the morning, my rough, dry feet saw a 50% improvement.  I repeated the process for 3 nights in a row and can honestly say I&#x27;m seeing 80% positive results.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their physical appearance with a natural, organic product.</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong with argon oil. It&#x27;s really good for the hair and skin. I&#x27;ve heard about it in so many places. Then I seen it on Dr Oz. I know I&#x27;m going to like this a lot. It&#x27;s not greasy and it not smelly.</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying it. I use it on my skin and plan to use it in my hair care regimen this week. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> During the winter my feet and my elbows become so dry and flaky. My husband&#x27;s hand are so cracked and dry also they hurt.. So this was a huge job this bottle had to do. we started with his hands,we used it day and night for 5 days..and his hands have improved so much. He says they aren&#x27;t hurting anymore and we will continue the day and night useage. My feet have become soft and smooth..  I started using it on my elbows after I shower...what an improvement..this is a Big bottle a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it to moisturize my hair, my face, dry patches of my skin, and for my cuticles. This is a high quality oil that does a great job. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Big bottle comparing to its price.</li>
            <li> Oily but not in a good way.  Using it makes you feel dirty.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! I have very dry skin and this makes my hands very soft and smooth with no greasy feeling. it absorbs quickly and smells wonderful. Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I love Swiss Botany products. I actually have several of thier products and I am very pleased with them all. This absolrbls so well into my skin. It makes it feel unbelieveably soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. It just takes a little so don&#x27;t over do it. Most definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and isn&#x27;t greasy. I like to use it on my elbows which were still rough even after using good lotion daily. The argan oil made my elbows soft after just one days use! I&#x27;m impressed! Also works good as a foot rub oil (my husband hates lotion, so this is a good alternative!) It is a such a quality product that it only takes a small amount to cover a lot of skin. This is no tiny bottle either. It will last a long time. And with their 100% money back guarantee, what do you have to lose!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair. I use it on my scalp also. Keeps my relaxed, colored hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Feels great, packaging looks great quality</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. I use it as an additive to some of my other carrier oils. I also use it straight up as a cuticle oil. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product. The glass jar and dropper made it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product - do not use much. A dime sized amount was way too much for my long hair.  Use a couple drops and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Skin,hair everywhere this stuff rocks.It is a wonderful carrier oil for EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> worked wonders on my hair and skin!!</li>
            <li> Swiss Botany&#x27;s Argan Oil is a product I didn&#x27;t know I would have to have!  You will not be disappointed with your purchase!  Fast shipping and beautifully packaged it is a product I love using and will purchase for others to experience as well!</li>
            <li> This has done wonders to my hair! Honestly my hair has never looked so healthy in 20 years!! It is shiny and smooth and NO FRIZZ!!! It has really changed my routine in the morning. I no longer have to mess with my hair, just brush, style and go!</li>
            <li> If for some reason I ever had to give up all of my beauty products except one, argan oil would be the one I&#x27;d keep. I started using it on my dry, damaged hair at a friend&#x27;s recommendation, and since then I&#x27;ve found a variety of other uses for it. I use it as a leave-in treatment every time I wash my hair (I have long hair, but just a drop or two is plenty), and to tame down the ends if they get frizzy between shampoos. I also add a drop to my moisturizer to keep my skin soft and smooth. AND it&#x27;s great for really rough patches of skin, like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetology, I highly recommend this product! It works great on my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it in my hair, as well is on my face. Works great!  Leaves my hair and skin feeling soft and silky.  A little goes a long way! Great value!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin when using this oil. Bye bye dry!</li>
            <li> I love it. I will buy again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about this argan oil! I have dry skin, hair and nails so I know it will help them all. This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels dry and irritated, I apply it everyday and the heels of my feet are smother then ever. I am no longer embarrassed to wear sandals.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy argan oil as many can smell rancid. this product had no scent at all, and the dropper is an easy way to apply the oil in precise amounts.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, so I was very excited to receive this. It has not disappointed. Its great for hair, I put it on my hair when its semi0damp and rub it into the ends. I swear Its sealed my split ends.</li>
            <li> Applied some to my hair before bed &amp; the next day after washing, my hair seems to be rehydrated!  I&#x27;m also applying a little to my nails and so far I&#x27;m liking the results!</li>
            <li> This works great on frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this for my dry hands and feet. The change from warm weather to cold weather always does my skin in and this has really helped make things better. I am so glad I found the Pure Argan Oil to make things less painful this year!</li>
            <li> I am posting this review for my wife since we have just one Amazon account.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this Argan Oil is triple virgin Argan Oil and I use it on my hair and finger nails. I am not sure I use it exactly right but I put it in my hair just before going to bed. It takes the frizz out and makes my hair feel good and healthy and easier to manage the next day. I know some people prefer to use it in the morning after washing their hair. As for my nails, it makes them feel stronger and healthier and again, I use it at night before going to bed. I recommend this product and have been telling my family about it. I just wish I would have tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> Love the argon oil for my hair. Can&#x27;t beat it with any other hair product for quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s very &#x27;absorbable&#x27;. Does not sit on skin or hair it&#x27;s soaks in which is what I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very please with this Argan oil. I use it everywhere in my body including my cuticles. I have extremely dry skin so this really helps during winter season.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing after using this - shiny, soft, and smooth.  Also works great on skin!</li>
            <li> Great oil! No smell but it does it work. My wife really satisfied with it! (So am I ))</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE Moroccan oil and this stuff is no exception! I put it in my hair after every shower (and a dab in with my conditioner) and it rocks my socks! Great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love argon oil!  Great product for so many uses.  I have used it in my hair, on my nails, on a rashy spot on hubby&#x27;s arm... It is good for all that.  Again, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this argan oil. I have very dry skin and this product makes such a difference. It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is the best!  I just got my Swiss Botany Oil &amp; immediately used it.  I put some on my cracked lips &amp; it felt so good!  I haven&#x27;t tried argan oil on my hair yet-but  by all accounts, it is great for your hair-,maybe when I get those winter fly-a-ways &amp; static.  I did put the oil on face &amp; used a face massager wand.  it was so relaxing while I watched TV.  You get a large bottle of 2 ounces with an eye dropper lid.  A little of this goes a long way.  Any oil left on your hands-can go on your hair or i put it on the backs of my hands. Now, I&#x27;m going to use this on my &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; neck.  Thanks for a great product I can afford!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my dry heels and feet. I am one who always thinks &amp;#34; a small amount&amp;#34; is not enough. Here it is.  If you put in hari make sure you use a very small amount. Has kept my hair soft for days after several washings.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with removing dark spots on my face and back. I have yet to see true results but I will continue to use the rest of this bottle. This is expensive and I am holding out that this product will do what it says and help to fade my dark spots. I like the oil feel and the smell is not bad. I still have about two weeks left on this bottle. I will update at the end of my bottle.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and this one is comparable to the pricier name brands that I usually buy.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with this!!  I especially like it for the soles of my feet that often get  dry and cracked. Great for dry hands or any dry patches of the body immediately remedies the dryness.....wonderful for my dry hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is amazing.  I&#x27;ve always had really frizzy, hard to manage hair with tons of flyaways.  Ever since I started using this, I&#x27;ve noticed a great improvement in my hair&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review which was perfect timing as I had just ran out of Argan oil. I put a few drops into my lotion bar mix right after I remove the mixture from heat which helps tremendously (in combination with the other ingredients) for my eczema which flares in the winter. I also put 2-3 drops onto my finger and rub in a circular motion onto my face after a shower. I&#x27;ve done this for a year with a different brand and everyone always complements me on my complexion. My guess is that because argan oil is natural, it doesn&#x27;t trigger any reactions from my normally moderately sensitive face. A few drops go a long way. I&#x27;ve used 7 drops before and it seems to have no additional benefits versus 2-3 drops. I also put a few drops in my palm, rub my palms together and use as a leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair. I used to use the serum but I&#x27;ve found pure Argan oil to work just as well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase! I have only been using this product for several days now and I can already notice the difference in my skin! I like that this product does not have an overpowering smell, nor does it leave ur skin feeling oily after applying. I would highly recommend this product to any and everyone! You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.After I get out of the shower I massage it in to my wet hair. It makes my hair shine!</li>
            <li> Awesome and fantastic product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I have sed Argan oil before but not sure if they were 100% pure. Immediately as applied it to my hand, I noticed the softness of my hands without a greasy feel. I applied to my legs, neck, and face. I especially love the non-greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m trying to use it sparingly but can&#x27;t resist applying all over.</li>

            <li> So many uses for this oil. Especially nice on your hair to keep it silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful natural moisturizer. It makes my hair shine so much even after all the treatments I have had on it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better. I have really dry skin especially when the weather changes and this has definitely made my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Argan oil. My skin just drinks it up . I also put it on the ends of my hair to help with split ends and I just love how shiny my hair is. I use this everyday on my face and hair .</li>
            <li> This is some of the best argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on nicely and is quickly absorbed into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  I also like to massage it into my nail beds....my nails are looking better than ever.  I also use just a dab in my hair too....I love that it can be used on my entire body.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> love this stuff .. great for my hair and skin</li>
            <li> I have used it for one month. It feels good and my face looks more lightening.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has been used in Morocco for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, cosmetic purposes, and in cuisine. Moroccans would use the oil as a topical ointment to treat skin diseases and irritated skin. They would also use the oil as a cosmetic product on their skin and hair. It moisturizes and softens skin. It also repairs and nourishes hair, improving scalp health and treating split-ends. It also is great for nails â€“ it can strengthen brittle nails and soften cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like massaging a drop of Argan Oil into my damp hair before I blow it dry. I find that my hair is less frizzy, my ends are less dry, and my hair has much more shine when I use Argan Oil. Over the winter, I like to massage a few drops of Argan Oil into the backs of my hands, as it provides lasting moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swiss Botanys  Argan Oil is 100% Pure and Organic. It is unscented, lightweight &amp; pure. It comes with a dropper for easy dispensing. I would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure triple extra virgin argan oil... grade no. 1.  I use this oil on my hair and face.... great product.</li>
