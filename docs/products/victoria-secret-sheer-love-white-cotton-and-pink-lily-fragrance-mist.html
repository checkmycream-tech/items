    <ol>
            <li> loved this i use it all the time</li>
            <li> I usually dont buy body sprays bc I think they smell, well, cheap. but a coworker was wearing this and I had to find out what it was. It smells very clean and refreshing, yet feminine. I was surprised when she told me what it was. I thought maybe she was wearing a great-smelling hand lotion. But I am very satisfied with this, great for everyday.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this. It isn&#x27;t too strong and it last practically all day.  The bottle is huge! bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s great, especially for it&#x27;s price üëç plus I got compliments for it also ^__</li>
            <li> Truly what they say, cotton/lily. A little more cotton than lily, not quite my scent tho.  Quick shipping</li>
            <li> great product and seller</li>
            <li> Smells great wife loved it</li>
            <li> I was gifted Sheer Love body lotion and fell in love with the scent. I was surprised the body mist is somewhat sweeter than the lotion but it lasts all day when combined together. Great scent for working with elementary students all day!</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I thought it had a delicious smell, I like this product and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work. It was a gift so I can&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  So glad I could buy it through you. Will re order when I run out again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It is a light fragrance, and one that my teenage granddaughter likes very much, as a matter of fact, her mom loves the scent also. It is usually on her Christmas or her birthday list of her favorite items.&lt;br /&gt;Jackie</li>
            <li> love it....quick delivery as promised</li>
            <li> The alchole scent in it is very noticable and you can barly smell the perfume thats the down side to it also the packaging was really messy and it didnt have that amazing Victoria s have</li>
            <li> Excellent. He loved my wife</li>
            <li> Gift. Arrived on time, no complaints</li>
            <li> It smells so good I love it.</li>
            <li> not to strong, nice feminine scent that doesn&#x27;t make those around you gag. Nice day or gym tote as well.</li>
            <li> I love their perfumes</li>
            <li> Got this product a while ago, use it everyday and has hardly made a dent in the bottle, absolutely love this smell, highly recommended-</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the excellent product</li>
            <li> Nice Summer scent for any age.</li>
            <li> Has an overly sweet, cloying scent.  Pump spray doesn&#x27;t work.  I would not buy this again, nor will I be trying any of the other scents.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet and soft scent of this mist spray. :)</li>
            <li> When I ordered this stuff I wasn&#x27;t even looking for this particular mist. My purchasing of it was based solely on the fact that it&#x27;s the only fragrance (for women) on Amazon that I&#x27;ve seen with a rating of 5 full-stars. Honestly not knowing what to expect, I must say that I&#x27;m undoubtedly pleasantly surprised, and satisfied with the scent. My husband was also pleased - so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. My husband said that it smells similar to the &#x27;cucumber melon&#x27; body-wash that I always enjoy using, and I agree. I have no complaints regarding product, it appears just as it is advertised, and the shipping experience was quicker than I expected it to be. I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a knock off but I was amazed that it was the actual deal! It smells amazing and i wear practically everyday.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift and the the recipient loves it.</li>
            <li> Marvelous fragrance , fast delivery</li>
            <li> Beautiful Scent :) absolutely love it and it&#x27;s just what i needed!</li>
