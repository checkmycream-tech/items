            <li>I get a nice, close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>These blades are perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this blades would be as good as the one that came on my schick razor when I originally bought it</li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive skin (very fair complexion, medium brown hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many types and brands of razors over the years.</li>
            <li>Anyway, love these blades.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>This one has been my favorite for years.  </li>

            <li>I love subscribe and save...</li>
            <li>and you always get a better deal than buying at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My reds don&#x27;t feel rashy after wards and they are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It shaves much better.</li>
            <li>but I love this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit, this product is worth the purchase!!</li>
            <li>So easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;These worked just fine, as they were the ones meant for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wifes lady parts are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>so I have to scour the earth to find cheap</li>
            <li>Ordering them on Amazon prime fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these razors (usually would just buy Venus) because they had a great coupon.</li>
            <li>Love the Schick Quattro more than any other product, particularly the Venus.</li>
            <li>and this is the only razor I&#x27;ve been able to use for an extended period of time without any adverse reactions occurring.</li>
            <li>Which is better than the price that you will pay at your local Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always personally thought that mens razors work better than womens&#x27;.</li>
            <li>razor is really well made</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have since realized that I really do like them</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>This item  is reasonably priced and comes in a pack of 2.</li>
            <li>The quality of these razor blades is also uniform, something else I didn&#x27;t find in other blades (one would be okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I am done with them, I do think I may move over to Dollar Shave club, as it is generally more affordable and you get more razor replacements, more often, at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing these away and getting new ones from Target.</li>
            <li>Came with a new handle too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself very frequently with them.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin also loves the product!</li>
            <li>I often break out after shaving, but the breakouts have lessened with this razor for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do love this razor, but the replacement heads are generally pretty expensive</li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a razor that completely protects against razor burn!</li>

            <li> Works great but am disgusted with this company charging significantly more for women&#x27;s razors than men&#x27;s aka the &amp;#34;pink tax&amp;#34; as if it weren&#x27;t bad enough that there is a significant gender wage gap</li>
            <li> It has been a week and a half, and I am now just starting to feel a tiny bit of roughness on my legs, &amp; I likely will not need to shave for another 2 to 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been buying these razors for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> Each cartridge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and even different Quattro and have gotten razor burn.</li>
            <li> With these sensitive skin blades, no more razor burn!</li>
            <li> The price is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I think the smoothing strip was dried up and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Schick Quattro and no more bumps.</li>
            <li> Before I could never find a razor that didn&#x27;t go dull immediately or cause skin irritation because of whatever lotion was in the moisture ribbon.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area for some reason.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the refiles are crazy expensive (comparatively speaking) &amp; not (yet) available in Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> with the mens&#x27; version, I had to shave my legs approximately every 3 days.</li>
            <li> and the next would be terrible).</li>
            <li> I finally found a razor with a moisture strip that doesn&#x27;t give me horrible razor burn or itchy legs.</li>
            <li> Razors are way too expensive these days.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase, I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because I often get bumps after wards.</li>
            <li> They caused awful razor burn and upon closer inspection</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many types and brands of razors over the years. I have rather sensitive skin (very fair complexion, medium brown hair) and this is the only razor I&#x27;ve been able to use for an extended period of time without any adverse reactions occurring. Before I could never find a razor that didn&#x27;t go dull immediately or cause skin irritation because of whatever lotion was in the moisture ribbon. The quality of these razor blades is also uniform, something else I didn&#x27;t find in other blades (one would be okay and the next would be terrible). Anyway, love these blades.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  I don&#x27;t care for those fancy curved supposedly ergonomic razors.  This one has been my favorite for years.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love subscribe and save... So easy and you always get a better deal than buying at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is really well made and I now consider it a treat (having upgraded from generic disposables)</li>
            <li> I have been buying these razors for a long time now.  That&#x27;s why I am confident saying that there was something wrong with the ones I received from this seller.  They caused awful razor burn and upon closer inspection I think the smoothing strip was dried up and cracked.  I ended up throwing these away and getting new ones from Target.</li>
            <li> cant believe I got 2 packs of these razors for only $14. That&#x27;s what 1 package costs in your local drug store. Very pleased...Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these razors (usually would just buy Venus) because they had a great coupon. I have since realized that I really do like them and they work incredibly well. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best deal for the count of razors. Way cheaper than any local store. My sensitive skin also loves the product! I get a way closer shave with these than with the Venus series.</li>
            <li> I s&amp;s to these razors. I am never without my refills. They are here before I even realize I need them. Great razor too!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal. I use these razors so it was a no brainer to purchase them in bulk and save a bunch of money. Came with a new handle too.</li>
            <li> These razors are very effective.  I often break out after shaving, but the breakouts have lessened with this razor for sensitive skin.  I get a very close shave. Each cartridge lasts a long time.  The price is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because I often get bumps after wards. I switched to Schick Quattro and no more bumps. My reds don&#x27;t feel rashy after wards and they are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect number of refills for a great razor.  I get a nice, close shave every time.  I especially like that this razor has a hair trimmer at the end.</li>
            <li> Terrific price... Lowest anywhere!</li>
            <li> These razor heads are great. I don&#x27;t cut myself very frequently with them. This is a good value. It was just a bit cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> Works great but am disgusted with this company charging significantly more for women&#x27;s razors than men&#x27;s aka the &amp;#34;pink tax&amp;#34; as if it weren&#x27;t bad enough that there is a significant gender wage gap</li>

Unfortunately the refiles are crazy expensive (comparatively speaking) &amp; not (yet) available in Subscribe &amp; Save. Hint hint, amazon...</li>
            <li> Hello all!! I have to admit, this product is worth the purchase!! This item  is reasonably priced and comes in a pack of 2. Which is better than the price that you will pay at your local Walmart or Target. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase, I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a great price.I hope they keep it coming! Razors are way too expensive these days.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor heads, and this is a great price - cheaper than I can get at our Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this blades would be as good as the one that came on my schick razor when I originally bought it but I am not a fan. Kinda wishing I didn&#x27;t bother with them cause now I am stuck with them!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe this...but I love this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always personally thought that mens razors work better than womens&#x27;. I have not used a woman&#x27;s razor in about 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my men&#x27;s Quattro, decided to give this one a shot. with the mens&#x27; version, I had to shave my legs approximately every 3 days. It has been a week and a half, and I am now just starting to feel a tiny bit of roughness on my legs, &amp; I likely will not need to shave for another 2 to 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a razor that completely protects against razor burn! It&#x27;s seriously incredible and I would recommend  this to anyone.</li>
