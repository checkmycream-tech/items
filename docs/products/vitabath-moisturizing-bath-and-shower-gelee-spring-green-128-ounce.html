            <li>For a department store product, $79 is a good price for the 128 bottle and although it comes with a pump, I use it to refill (with the aid of a funnel) my squeeze bottle I keep in the shower.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s smells great and makes you feel so clean.</li>

            <li>I was so satisfied with the efficiency of your company.  </li>
            <li>Vitabath Bath &amp; Shower Gel is the most wonderful bath product available; it makes your shower complete.</li>
            <li>You can use it to soak in the tub or for a refreshing shower.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for many, many years and still love it.</li>
            <li>your probaly better of buying bar soap.</li>
            <li>It might be a better deal here now.</li>
            <li>The product has been around forever and nothing is more relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it as more of a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>awesome last like a year</li>
            <li>Enjoyed product</li>
            <li>Vitabath smells amazing and the clean scent lingers on your skin for quite some time without being overly perfumed.  </li>
            <li>The smell is incredible while one is showering it scents the whole bathroom with a outdoorsy up in the mountains fresh air smell.</li>
            <li>I love the original secent of Vitabath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years, and buying the huge 128oz each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spring Green is wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li>They told me they would send it to me free of charge.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li>A WONDERFUL PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Buy the gallon - much better price and lasts so much longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product was returned for a full refund (thank you Amazon), but we will never purchase anything that is sold by Vitabath again.</li>
            <li>About the only thing that has not changed is the price, (now we can easily say this stuff is way over priced!</li>
            <li>- first Badedas in Europe (40 years ago...)</li>
            <li>I really hope not!</li>
            <li>The travel bottle is the old familiar formula.</li>
            <li>My wife was particularly fond of the fresh forest smell this gelee had.</li>
            <li>While the new bottle is not unpleasant, it is not what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I Can&#x27;t recommend this product anymore and not due to the seller, they were awesome and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>And you are stuck with a large amount of Vitabath and no way to get it out of the container.  </li>
            <li>The pine smell permeates the whole house.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin or make you break out and leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The new one is thinner, more blue in color and lacks the intense pine-like fragrance of the old.</li>
            <li>aroma is neither masculine nor feminine, and is very energizing.  </li>
            <li>and it has been very disapointing because it has been watered down form the original.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I called Vitabath in New York and asked them to please send me a replacement pump.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased a large bottle of the Original Spring Green Bath and Shower Gelee.</li>
            <li>We will probably use it up, but unless the formula goes back to the original or the quality-control issue is solved, it will be the last bottle I purchase.</li>
            <li>A capful is all it takes for a tubful of luxuriant bubbles, and even less when used in the shower, so it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li>which is generally pretty long.  </li>
            <li>it leave your skin soft and buttery.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>The product perfume was changed completely without notifying the customers on the label or page description.</li>
            <li>Have tried the newer fragrances, butstill prefer the Original Spring Green, and its soothing herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>I live in NC where the temp regularly gets to 100 degrees on a summer day.  </li>
            <li>It is often hard for her to find so this quantity was a huge hit.</li>
            <li>The original version of Vitabath was a thick gel and the smell</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The soap Original Spring Green has changed its formula for the worse and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it used to.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s not acceptable or even close to the old scent which I have used for 30 years, and I seriously considered sending it back in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a like a watered down version with the same scent.</li>
            <li> Previously, the pumps had a spring in them and were well made and lasted the entire time that you had the gallon product....</li>
            <li> I had a little left in the old bottle I purchased sometime in the past year and compared the two side-by-side.</li>
            <li> I would send it back, but it is heavy and cumbersome to return.</li>
            <li> Spring Green is the only one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> , the last two times, the product has been like watered down, not so green, and the fragrance is nothing like it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Other than the smell</li>
            <li> I also compared it to a small travel-sized bottle I got last month.</li>
            <li> I would not use the other scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pine scent and might be somewhat stronger than you&#x27;re accustomed to with the typical drugstore shower gels.</li>
            <li> The company should have listed the change in ingredients on the bottle or on the description page on Amazon instead of ripping everyone off like greedy dicks and they are going to lose their few remaining customers now.</li>
            <li> Now the pump breaks in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> Have purchashed this item in the past elsewhere</li>
            <li> This last purchase was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.  </li>
            <li> Did I just get a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and will search another body wash.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Sadly, I Can&#x27;t recommend this product anymore and not due to the seller, they were awesome and shipped quickly. The soap Original Spring Green has changed its formula for the worse and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it used to. In fact it&#x27;s not acceptable or even close to the old scent which I have used for 30 years, and I seriously considered sending it back in. It&#x27;s that rotten. However my post office won&#x27;t take liquids. The company should have listed the change in ingredients on the bottle or on the description page on Amazon instead of ripping everyone off like greedy dicks and they are going to lose their few remaining customers now. I will bet you my last dollar on that. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> A WONDERFUL PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.  GREAT VALUE; GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time - first Badedas in Europe (40 years ago...) and here the Vitabath is just as great.... that&#x27;s why I keep re-ordering it, again  and again. Great, enjoyable product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all my life.  Have tried the newer fragrances, butstill prefer the Original Spring Green, and its soothing herbal scent.  A capful is all it takes for a tubful of luxuriant bubbles, and even less when used in the shower, so it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied with the efficiency of your company.  I received my products well before the date it was promised.</li>
            <li> Vitabath Bath &amp; Shower Gel is the most wonderful bath product available; it makes your shower complete. You feel as if you have had a awesome massage afterwards. Quality item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years, and buying the huge 128oz each time.&lt;br /&gt;But, the last two times, the product has been like watered down, not so green, and the fragrance is nothing like it used to be.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will search another body wash.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Vitabath for years. It&#x27;s great for your skin and you don&#x27;t have to even rinse it off. You can use it to soak in the tub or for a refreshing shower. Always a classic for a good reason!</li>
            <li> I love the original secent of Vitabath.  It&#x27;s a pine scent and might be somewhat stronger than you&#x27;re accustomed to with the typical drugstore shower gels. Definitely not for the faint of heart.  I live in NC where the temp regularly gets to 100 degrees on a summer day.  This shower gel is going to keep you fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is neither masculine nor feminine, and is very energizing.  Great lather, with a good clean feeling at the end of a quick shower.  This size is enough to last for several months.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a surprise Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my wife. She was already sold on the merits of Vitabath shower gel. It is often hard for her to find so this quantity was a huge hit. A great buy.</li>
            <li> wonderful for skin...</li>
            <li> Spring Green is wonderful on the skin. It leaves the skin smooth and fresh.  The smell is incredible while one is showering it scents the whole bathroom with a outdoorsy up in the mountains fresh air smell. I have been buying this product for many, many years and still love it.</li>
            <li> The original version of Vitabath was a thick gel and the smell would stay with you throughout the day. This stuff is a like a watered down version with the same scent. The smell washes of your body with the soap. About the only thing that has not changed is the price, (now we can easily say this stuff is way over priced! The reason I give it two stars is that when I smell it in the bottle it still reminds me of my childhood at grandma&#x27;s house. Other than the smell your probaly better of buying bar soap.</li>
            <li> The pumps on the Vitabath gallon are now garbage.  It&#x27;s too bad.  I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years, but recently they have decided to change the pumps on the gallon.  Previously, the pumps had a spring in them and were well made and lasted the entire time that you had the gallon product....which is generally pretty long.  Now the pump breaks in a few weeks.  It&#x27;s junk.  And you are stuck with a large amount of Vitabath and no way to get it out of the container.  So I&#x27;ve had to transfer it to smaller generic containers just to use it up.  I won&#x27;t be buying the gallon again.  By the way, I called Vitabath in New York and asked them to please send me a replacement pump.  I even said I would be happy to pay for it.  They told me they would send it to me free of charge.  Of course it never came.  Don&#x27;t buy the gallon!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitabath since I was a kid. It&#x27;s smells great and makes you feel so clean. I buy mine on drugstore.com for $79 for the 128 oz. It might be a better deal here now.</li>
            <li> Have purchashed this item in the past elsewhere and it has been very disapointing because it has been watered down form the original.  This IS the original and we are very happy.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Vitabath is the best bubble bath in the world! it has a great piney scent and make tons of bubbles. it leave your skin soft and buttery. the big bottle, 128 oz, makes for lots and lots of bathes.</li>
            <li> The product has been around forever and nothing is more relaxing.  The pine smell permeates the whole house.  Wow...I even bought it for my ex-wife.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a large bottle of the Original Spring Green Bath and Shower Gelee. I was dissapointed to discover the smell, color and consistency have all changed! I had a little left in the old bottle I purchased sometime in the past year and compared the two side-by-side. The new one is thinner, more blue in color and lacks the intense pine-like fragrance of the old. I would describe it as more of a citrus smell. I also compared it to a small travel-sized bottle I got last month. The travel bottle is the old familiar formula. Did I just get a bad batch? Are there quality control issues with multiple manufactures, or has the formula actually changed? I really hope not! I just looked at the recent reviews on Amazon and I now see that I am not the only one who has noticed this. While the new bottle is not unpleasant, it is not what I hoped for. I would send it back, but it is heavy and cumbersome to return. We will probably use it up, but unless the formula goes back to the original or the quality-control issue is solved, it will be the last bottle I purchase. Very sad.</li>
            <li> Incredible product delivered on time. Buy the gallon - much better price and lasts so much longer.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of the individual containers to refill.</li>
            <li> Vitabath is a pricey product line and buying the 128 bottle will give you the best bang for your buck.  Vitabath smells amazing and the clean scent lingers on your skin for quite some time without being overly perfumed.  It does not dry your skin or make you break out and leaves you feeling clean.  For a department store product, $79 is a good price for the 128 bottle and although it comes with a pump, I use it to refill (with the aid of a funnel) my squeeze bottle I keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> awesome last like a year</li>
            <li> been using vita bath since the 70&#x27;s  Great product. k</li>
            <li> We have been buying this product for years. My wife was particularly fond of the fresh forest smell this gelee had. This last purchase was very disappointing. The product perfume was changed completely without notifying the customers on the label or page description. The product was returned for a full refund (thank you Amazon), but we will never purchase anything that is sold by Vitabath again.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  Makes every bath luxurious.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would not use the other scents. Spring Green is the only one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.  Enjoyed product</li>
