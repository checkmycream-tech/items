            <li>OPI is such a quality nail polish, and it&#x27;s nice to have a large variety of colors to choose from without having to purchase the full bottle.</li>
            <li>Small bottles but great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about getting these nail polishes , Ive alway wanted OPi nail polishes cause a lot of people talked about it and seemed to be satisfied with the product, bsides its has a really wide range of colors, which is just perfect!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Bought for a gift for a teenage grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>

            <li>, better start with little samples to later buy the normal size ones.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be surprised.  </li>
            <li>MY MOM IS 87 YEARS YOUNG.</li>
            <li>The sample size is just big enough to help you choose if you like the color enough to buy the full sized bottle.</li>
            <li>and it was very watery when we got it, low quality overall.</li>
            <li>There was a nice array of colors and you can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have such a variety of colors without having to buy the big expensive bottle first.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are a little translucent and don&#x27;t show up very well.</li>

            <li> Purchased for a Christmas gift.  Small bottles but great for traveling.  OPI shows less wear than most nail polish.  I would recommend OPI for nails.</li>
            <li> cool gift for some one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. The only negative I have is these are tiny bottles of nail polish. Very very small.</li>
            <li> The nail polish took a while ot arrive and it was very watery when we got it, low quality overall.</li>
            <li> bought several sets of this for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them.  However, they are really small... so don&#x27;t be surprised.  The color options were great.</li>
            <li> Everything was right got in a timely fashion smaller than the picture looked but I still love it&lt;br /&gt;It is a good value for all the colors</li>
            <li> OPI is such a quality nail polish, and it&#x27;s nice to have a large variety of colors to choose from without having to purchase the full bottle.</li>
            <li> For those who can&#x27;t use regular polish, this polish is wonderful, and perfect for tucking in travel kit and purse for touchups, The company went WAY out of their way to get it to my hotel before traveling out of US for extended period.</li>
            <li> The OPI nail gift set was a cute combination of the OPI colors. I know that the bottles are only samples but I wish they would have been a little larger. Colors are all really cute. Made for a great christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I  dont  have to  write a  lot  for  this product because  i  took  it  for  my  sister  but  as she  said  to  me the  quality  is the  best .  Also the item  was  in our  hands to  fast.  So  5  stars is  ok</li>
            <li> Bought for a gift for a teenage grand daughter. She loved it! ( probably has it all used up by now. Would give this co. a A as I had prompt, undamaged delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the small bottles and that I got OPI&#x27;s top ten colors for 2012!  It makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and it is soooo cute!!  OPI nail products are the best out there and this set is perfect for trying different colors without having to buy the normal sized bottles and find you don&#x27;t like it.  Another nice thing is that the top and bottom groups of colors are packaged so that you can break up the box and give each one as a separate gift.  There seems to be plenty of polish in each bottle to do your nails several times.  Fun colors, too.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this set.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece for Christmas.  She loved it! There was a nice array of colors and you can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI quality.</li>
            <li> small amounts but thats a great thing. A large variety of colors. Getting tired of gel nails and plan to polish often.</li>
            <li> I love buying the sample sizes of OPI nail polishes for a couple of reasons. 1)The nail brushes are smaller and it&#x27;s easier to fill my nails with color without the color getting all over my skin. 2) The sample size is just big enough to help you choose if you like the color enough to buy the full sized bottle. 3) With a pack like this that offers many colors, it takes a while before you need a new bottle. The pack of colors is great, the only problem is that a few of them are very similar and therefore creates a lack of diversity. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY MOM FOR CHRISTMAS, BUT I LOVE ALL THEIR POLISHES.  MY MOM IS 87 YEARS YOUNG.</li>
            <li> Made a good stocking stuffer for my wife who liked the variety of colors. The bottles could have been bigger but overall she liked the set.</li>
            <li> Love these polishes.  I don&#x27;t paint my nails very often, resulting in the polish going bad.  I also stick to cheaper brands, of course I know and love OPI but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money buying a bunch of shades.  This is perfect!  Lots of colors to choose from when I decide to paint my nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to have some go to basic colors and I love it! Perfect sizes to try each one and purchase larger if you really need to!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are a little translucent and don&#x27;t show up very well. The white color kind of looks like shiny white-out, but for detail work it&#x27;s great. The darker colors are beautiful and the reds are great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great deal for the cheap price!!! Real OPI quality too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Rapid ship and excellent communication!  The whole world knows you can never determine the condition of the nail polish until you open the bottle - this OPI polish is in excellent new condition - Thanks for a great item!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. The set was pretty nice, but the nail polishes are quite small. It would be nice if more sets like this were available as OPI is a great brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this as one Christmas present for my 19-year-old daughter who enjoys lots of nail polish.  She was really happy with it and said she really loved the color selection.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister in law. She absolutely loved it. Apparently it has a color that is difficult to find in it. She was really happy to get such a large selection.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the colors!!! OPI is awesome!! Wish the bottles were normal size so I could use them more than one or two times.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone, I love it&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good deal and everyone shoud go for it!</li>
            <li> Well, I received the item as expected,  I was so excited about getting these nail polishes , Ive alway wanted OPi nail polishes cause a lot of people talked about it and seemed to be satisfied with the product, bsides its has a really wide range of colors, which is just perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However , I didnt realize those were the &#x27;mini&#x27; ones.. but it&#x27;s okay, better start with little samples to later buy the normal size ones. I tried the Tickle my France-y one during my stay in paris and I really love it, very nice for winter time! :)</li>
            <li> I love these the color is rich and very amazing to wear.  It is a lot of fun and I love the options of color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich colors.the very dark almost black...Lincoln park is my favorite</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my sister and she loves it! It&#x27;s fun to have such a variety of colors without having to buy the big expensive bottle first. I may order a set for myself!</li>
            <li> These were very nice colors. I purchased them as a gift but I just wish that they were a little larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these polishes to others but keep in mind that they are ever bit as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; as they are described.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely raves about it.  It&#x27;s the only nail polish that she can wear for longer than a week without having the polish start to chip out on her.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, and this gift pack is an excellent selection at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my sister as a gift for Christmas. She enjoys trying out all of the different colors. By using this set she can gauge which colors she likes the most, and I&#x27;ll get her larger bottles of just those. Great starter nail kit.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my daughters and my niece for Christmas and they all were very happy with it.</li>
