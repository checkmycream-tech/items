            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I want another one for sure!</li>
            <li>Handy case to carry my essentials oils in.</li>
            <li>Very easy to move, and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has a very cheap hand feel.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>It keeps them safe and snug.</li>
            <li>It needs to be more sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful carrying case for essential oils.</li>
            <li>Both the 5 ml and the 15 ml bottles fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of this case.</li>
            <li>But I still love this case.</li>
            <li>Love this case....</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the 4inches tall and</li>
            <li>not the 3inches tall as this one holds the 15ml bottles much better.  </li>
            <li>love the fact it has handles on top</li>
            <li>May have to buy another one soon! :)</li>
            <li>Love that it is compact and easy to see the bottle tops (my oil bottles have labels on top).  </li>
            <li>And it is easy to keep them safe at home too.</li>
            <li>It is light weight zipper glides easily.</li>
            <li>Still works fine just gets stuck every now and then.</li>
            <li>I even have them mixed in my case and they all fit great.</li>
            <li>Great holds different sizes.</li>
            <li>so the bottles are secure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to take on trips as well not big and bulky.</li>
            <li>Great bag for essential oils</li>
            <li>Holds the oils comfortable and</li>
            <li>When it is filled with bottles and you pick it up by the handle all the dividers come up and your bottles are now on the bottom.</li>
            <li>After labeling the tops of the caps, I&#x27;ve been able to pluck out exactly what oil I wanted quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>this is the best case I have found so far to hold my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I  will order another one, mine is full.</li>
            <li>Well-made, easy to stock and carry, and also it is pretty.</li>
            <li>but more like a super duper bright lime green.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at first that the fabric was kind of &amp;#34;flannel&amp;#34;y.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It honestly looks like something you&#x27;d pick up at big lots or the dollar store.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the felt.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to zip it completely before trying to lift by handle or the zipper will unzip and threaten to dump the oils onto the floor.</li>
            <li>do recommend getting circle labels for the tops of the bottles, so you don&#x27;t have to pull them out one by one, looking at the bottle labels before finding the right ones.  </li>
            <li>I have the black and grey and it&#x27;s perfect for my d≈çTERRA oils.</li>
            <li>The cell compartments for the oils work pretty well</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the 15-bottle case and love it!</li>
            <li>I really did not care for this.</li>
            <li>They transport easily and are protected from clunking against each other.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it does the job, but the quality is pretty lacking for a $26 container.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>, however, I would have appreciated if they would have been secured to the bottom of the holder - I forsee the possibility of done of the smaller bottles shifting out of their holder during travel.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is soft, but sturdy (I think there is foam in between the layers)</li>
            <li>I really like this bag for my oils, only problem is that if all my bottles were 15ml it would not hold the 30 bottles as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I really wish it weren&#x27;t quite so deep.</li>
            <li>It keeps the oils dark, cool and protected any where you are.</li>
            <li>I have mostly 15ml bottles and a few 5ml mixed in.</li>
            <li>I already have the smaller size but was ready for the bigger size.</li>
            <li>Wow after trying to find a protective way to store my oils, I finally found it!</li>
            <li>It fit all of my large and small essential oils bottles and even a few of the roller-ball bottles I had made up.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!  Perfect for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> This product has a very cheap hand feel. It honestly looks like something you&#x27;d pick up at big lots or the dollar store. It&#x27;s almost like a craft felt type of fabric.  The cell compartments for the oils work pretty well, however, I would have appreciated if they would have been secured to the bottom of the holder - I forsee the possibility of done of the smaller bottles shifting out of their holder during travel.  Overall, it does the job, but the quality is pretty lacking for a $26 container.</li>
            <li> I use this to store my nail polish - perfect fit! I actually bought two so I can sort out the neutrals and the brights.Love them!</li>
            <li> Color was not at all like it looks in the picture.  This was not a teal but more like a super duper bright lime green.  Not great quality either.  Not crazy about the felt.  I ended up buying another.  I should have returned this one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at first that the fabric was kind of &amp;#34;flannel&amp;#34;y. I was expecting a smoother cotton fabric. It is light weight zipper glides easily. Just make sure to zip it completely before trying to lift by handle or the zipper will unzip and threaten to dump the oils onto the floor. The bottles sit relatively snugly in the compartments, even the 5mls. I have had the 10mls roller bottles in there. They don&#x27;t fit perfectly, but you can zip it close.</li>
            <li> Wow after trying to find a protective way to store my oils, I finally found it! I traveled with this across the country flying. None of the bottles broke. It keeps the oils dark, cool and protected any where you are. Highly recommend!!! And it is easy to keep them safe at home too. I love this!!!</li>
            <li> This holds and protects my 1oz/30ml bottles very nicely.  Very easy to move, and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend getting circle labels for the tops of the bottles, so you don&#x27;t have to pull them out one by one, looking at the bottle labels before finding the right ones.  After labeling the tops of the caps, I&#x27;ve been able to pluck out exactly what oil I wanted quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It is nice to keep my ols in, it is a little flimsy, but not too bad. It keeps them safe and snug.</li>
            <li> Great holds different sizes. No issues</li>
            <li> The case is great. Ordered&lt;br /&gt;It for my mother-in-law. I personally think essential oils are a scam but oh well.</li>
            <li> It fit all of my large and small essential oils bottles and even a few of the roller-ball bottles I had made up.  Love that it is compact and easy to see the bottle tops (my oil bottles have labels on top).  The fabric is soft, but sturdy (I think there is foam in between the layers) so the bottles are secure.  Wish I would have gotten this sooner!</li>
            <li> This the perfect case for keeping your oils safe and easy to get to.  It&#x27;s great to take on trips as well not big and bulky.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product, but the execution the design is flawed. No matter if I put 5 ml or 15ml bottles in it, they all slip through and end up all mixed together under the separators and then are hard to get out. The separator panel needs to be lowered closer to the bottom of the case. The case is also too flexible. It needs to be more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have the black and grey and it&#x27;s perfect for my d≈çTERRA oils. I have mostly 15ml bottles and a few 5ml mixed in. I&#x27;m gonna buy one for each of my team members!</li>
            <li> Handy case to carry my essentials oils in.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful carrying case for essential oils. Both the 5 ml and the 15 ml bottles fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of this case. I already have the smaller size but was ready for the bigger size. The only concern is the zipper is not the greastest. Still works fine just gets stuck every now and then. But I still love this case.</li>
            <li> Great bag for essential oils</li>
            <li> This item arrived in 3-4 days of my purchase.  The carrying case is wonderful, holds all my oils from the smallest to the largest!</li>
            <li> Love this case....have in the 16 bottle size as well.  Well-made, easy to stock and carry, and also it is pretty.</li>
            <li> this is the best case I have found so far to hold my essential oils.  They transport easily and are protected from clunking against each other.  Just make sure you get the 4inches tall and not the 3inches tall as this one holds the 15ml bottles much better.  I have already bought a 2nd one and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I really like this bag for my oils, only problem is that if all my bottles were 15ml it would not hold the 30 bottles as advertised.  My assortment are 5ml and 15ml and it&#x27;s a tight fit.  I  will order another one, mine is full.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works great. Holds the oils comfortable and the scent from all the oils makes this bag a air freshener.</li>
            <li> I really did not care for this. The dividers are not attached to the bottom of the case. When it is filled with bottles and you pick it up by the handle all the dividers come up and your bottles are now on the bottom.</li>
            <li> great with lots of padding!!</li>
            <li> the best carrier.. love the fact it has handles on top</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I needed. May have to buy another one soon! :)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. It is very handy to be able to carry all your oils with you. I love this product! Fits 1 fl oz and 2 fl oz perfect. I even have them mixed in my case and they all fit great. Great buy!</li>
            <li> 2 of the 3 I ordered were great other one was falling apart at the seams. Didn&#x27;t feel like sending back so just using as is. Would have gave 5 stars if all were in great shape!</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding my oils and no worries that I will spill anything. I want another one for sure!</li>
            <li> I really wish it weren&#x27;t quite so deep. I previously purchased the 15-bottle case and love it! However, as my oil collection grew, I wanted something that would hold all my oils. It is just too deep and the bottles tend to fall through.</li>
