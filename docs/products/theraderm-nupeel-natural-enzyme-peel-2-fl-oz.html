            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>I always follow the rinsing with a toner (I use a rose water toner) and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was using Retin A for a while and this products was excellent in helping remove the flaking skin associated with such products.  </li>
            <li>I love this peel.</li>
            <li>I will say, it did smell better than the Aloette.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel much more smooth during this proces.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy as it sounds.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference to the texture of my skin -</li>
            <li>I have used stronger more powerful products that this one....</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does sound kind of gross, but when you&#x27;re doing it it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>this product might be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>favorite way to use this is right before I get in the shower.</li>
            <li>Based on about two weeks of use, I have been very pleased thus far.</li>
            <li>I first used this product when I was working at a upscale salon as an esthetician and fell in love.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft and smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I had to use too much pressure and too much pulling than I&#x27;m comfortable using.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry you kind of just wipe it off.</li>
            <li>It did not remove any dead skin did not leave my skin bright or glowing.</li>
            <li>I use first then wash well afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product by a plastic surgeon who prefers to do non-invasive stuff as a first line approach.</li>
            <li>But this product just sits there until I get a washclothe and hot water and remove it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very effective at getting rid of dry skin as long as you make sure you&#x27;re hands and skin are not wet at all before using otherwise</li>
            <li>I decided to try the whole Theraderm skin care system and</li>
            <li>So much nicer than a scrub because you are sloughing off skin cells without scraping off ones that are intact.  </li>
            <li>I was really just underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended the NuPeel natural enzyme peel, and I have been pleased, would recommend and purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Makes my dry, flaky skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Nu Peel is gentle on sensitive skin and works really well to remove the resulting exfoliiation/peeling.  </li>
            <li>My regimen is: cleanse, let face THOROUGHLY dry, and then rub this on your face with dry hands (this is very important).  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>But with Theraderm -NuPeel Natural Enzyme Peel I have results right the way, and no more after peeling problem and my skin looks clean, soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, I recommended it to all my clients and have come to expect nothing less when ordering online.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and neck, start rubbing my skin to create the little balls, and when it seems I&#x27;ve pretty much made as many little balls as there are to be made, I jump in the shower and rinse it all off (balls of skin and all...)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can go on with my day without looking like a red-faced freak.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft after, skin tone even.</li>
            <li>So far no results, no difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and based on the reviews I read here</li>
            <li>This product is fast acting, but gentle enough not to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This makes rinsing completely easier and  I&#x27;ve added this step to my routine.  </li>
            <li>First of all I tried regular medical peels like Jessner and PCA.</li>
            <li>I have to use all sorts of soothing serum to calm it down.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have found some products much too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Dead skin simply rolls away leaving fresh brightened skin.</li>

            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I feel that it did not take enough dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I washed my face right away, but unfortunately the skin was already irritated.  </li>

            <li> I peel for very long period of time  (weeks) with them and not the whole face but partially in different areas it makes almost impossible to use make-up.</li>
            <li> down the drain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to use very little so even though it&#x27;s a small bottle it last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using less makeup too, because my foundation goes on easier.</li>
            <li> I do notice a little redness on my nose but nothing too distracting.  </li>
            <li> It seems to loosen all the dead skin and your rubbing turns it into little balls that fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Theraderm NuPeel Enzyme Peel for several years now.  I was using Retin A for a while and this products was excellent in helping remove the flaking skin associated with such products.  I decided to try the whole Theraderm skin care system and WOW!  what a difference it has made in my skin.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I Tried this product and to my disappointment the product did nothing. It goes on like a gel, you leave it on for the 5  10 min, suppose to like peel off. It did not remove any dead skin did not leave my skin bright or glowing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lik  this peel. The reason is that you have to massage/scrub it off with your finger tips. Not as easy as it sounds. I had to use too much pressure and too much pulling than I&#x27;m comfortable using. I&#x27;m not trying to stretch my facial skin out but you can&#x27;t help if it you want this product to roll the dead skin cells off..  I ended up using a wet washcloth. Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. I have HORRIBLE KP on the backs of my legs and I never used to wear skirts or shorts, but an aesthetician started me on this stuff and I adore it.  Yay NuPeel!</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of Retin-A 1-2 times a week.  Nu Peel is gentle on sensitive skin and works really well to remove the resulting exfoliiation/peeling.  It has made my skin feel much more smooth during this proces.  Based on about two weeks of use, I have been very pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I was working at a upscale salon as an esthetician and fell in love. You need to use very little so even though it&#x27;s a small bottle it last quite a while. I like to use it on my face, it works great to smooth out unevenness and make your skin really bright, but you can use it almost anywhere. Hands and feet are great to use it on too. Fantastic product, I recommended it to all my clients and have come to expect nothing less when ordering online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years on the recommendation of my cosmetologist. I use it between glycolic peels. It&#x27;s also very effective at getting rid of dry skin as long as you make sure you&#x27;re hands and skin are not wet at all before using otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work. I use first then wash well afterwards.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than a scrub because you are sloughing off skin cells without scraping off ones that are intact.  It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can go on with my day without looking like a red-faced freak.  I do notice a little redness on my nose but nothing too distracting.  My regimen is: cleanse, let face THOROUGHLY dry, and then rub this on your face with dry hands (this is very important).  I then let it sit for the recommended 30-60 seconds and then rub in circular motion.  I always follow the rinsing with a toner (I use a rose water toner) and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This peel shocks me everytime I use it! Spread in face leave 2 min and rub in circles. Beads of skin will begin to form. It still makes me skeptical that it is actual skin beading and not some chemical compound that forms beads bc it&#x27;s so amazing! I have yet to find anything to say that the beads aren&#x27;t skin. Skin feels so soft after, skin tone even. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have used stronger more powerful products that this one....this product might be good for sensitive skin. I feel that it did not take enough dead skin off.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Dead skin simply rolls away leaving fresh brightened skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist sold this to me in her office.  It&#x27;s a great exfoliant without abrasion.  Just leave a thin layer on your skin for a minute, then rub off the dead skin into little balls that you can wash away.  Remember to only use on dry skin with dry hands.  I&#x27;ve found that it just doesn&#x27;t work with any moisture, even humidity from the shower.</li>
            <li> Love!! Makes my dry, flaky skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this peel. First of all I tried regular medical peels like Jessner and PCA. I peel for very long period of time  (weeks) with them and not the whole face but partially in different areas it makes almost impossible to use make-up. But with Theraderm -NuPeel Natural Enzyme Peel I have results right the way, and no more after peeling problem and my skin looks clean, soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it a couple times a week and it makes my skin smooth and glowy!!! I&#x27;m using less makeup too, because my foundation goes on easier.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a plastic surgeon who prefers to do non-invasive stuff as a first line approach. This stuff is absolutely amazing! you put it on dry skin (emphasis on dry - you can&#x27;t be in the shower, have damp or sweaty skin, etc.) leave it a minute then begin to rub, all of a sudden you feel little balls of dead skin everywhere you rub. It seems to loosen all the dead skin and your rubbing turns it into little balls that fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to use this is right before I get in the shower. I put it on my face and neck, start rubbing my skin to create the little balls, and when it seems I&#x27;ve pretty much made as many little balls as there are to be made, I jump in the shower and rinse it all off (balls of skin and all...) down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sound kind of gross, but when you&#x27;re doing it it feels amazing. You don&#x27;t want to leave all that dead skin stuck on your body do you? I do this about once per week and it&#x27;s made a huge difference to the texture of my skin - it&#x27;s super soft and smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive skin care systems recommended by doctors (dermatologist and plastic surgeons).  If I could only buy one skin care product it would be this one.  It exfoliates perfectly and in a very pleasant way. I use the entire line alternating with Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Fruit Enzyme peel from Aloette (green goo in a jar). I was looking for a cheaper alternative and learned you get what you pay for. It did seem to work but definitely is not comparable to the Aloette version. I was really just underwhelmed. I will say, it did smell better than the Aloette.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be like when you were a kid and coated your hand with Elmer&#x27;s Glue and rubbed it off. But this product just sits there until I get a washclothe and hot water and remove it. It doesn&#x27;t dry you kind of just wipe it off. So far no results, no difference. What is this stuff?</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me.  I have sensitive skin and based on the reviews I read here I wanted to try it.  Within seconds of application I felt burning and stinging sensation.  I washed my face right away, but unfortunately the skin was already irritated.  I have to use all sorts of soothing serum to calm it down.  Oh well.........I guess different skin react differently to this product.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the NuPeel natural enzyme peel, and I have been pleased, would recommend and purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> After trying a sample given to me after my last facial, I decided to purchase this product. I have sensitive skin and have found some products much too harsh.  This product is fast acting, but gentle enough not to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciate another reviewer describing her use of the enzyme peel before showering.  This makes rinsing completely easier and  I&#x27;ve added this step to my routine.  I recommend it.</li>
