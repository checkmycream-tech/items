            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>NYX has always been one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li>They have so many colors to choose from, and the color you see on the stick itself, is the color that&#x27;s going to be on your lips.</li>
            <li>but it is more of a lavender.</li>
            <li>I love all of nyx cosmetics</li>
            <li>the price of this is super cheap but the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>APPLY REALLY EASY AND SMOOTH , ......</li>
            <li>but this is a super gem!</li>
            <li>It is a light lilac color.</li>
            <li>These colors are used to compare to a cheap version or MAC colors.</li>
            <li>Once I mix it with a pink lip liner the color turns out real nice.</li>
            <li>very fresh shade of lilac..</li>
            <li>Very creamy color that has good intense and noticeable pigmentation.</li>
            <li>This is a great color, it looks pink in the tube</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, this lipstick is true to color and has a nice texture .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying and experimenting with new makeup, and NYX lipsticks are my top choice.</li>
            <li>You run into colors that look completely different on skin, than on the stick, but these colors are very true to how they look.</li>
            <li>more of a purple than a pink unlike the picture.</li>
            <li>it really is creamy wish</li>
            <li>No issues however with seller who shipped the product lighting fast.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Goes on creamy and smooth and last for hours!</li>
            <li>The colors are extremely creamy and they last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone, and I&#x27;m a white female with pretty average skin.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy, went on with such ease and complete coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really either pink or purple, more of a chalk/purplish gray.</li>
            <li>This does not dry my lips at all or cause any irritation.</li>

            <li> This color is not at all like expected.  </li>

            <li> It is really pale.</li>
            <li> But without a lip liner of any color this shade is really pale.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORSE LIPSTICK EVER</li>
            <li> This lipstick smells terrible, like old playdoh, it has almost no staying power, and a greasy texture.</li>
            <li> But color looks like something to paint a wall with... not for lipstick unfortunately.</li>
            <li> had the color not been disappointing.</li>

            <li> This color is very interesting. It is a light lilac color. It is really pale. So whenever I wear it I usually mix it up with a pink lip liner to give it some extra color. Once I mix it with a pink lip liner the color turns out real nice. But without a lip liner of any color this shade is really pale.</li>
            <li> very fresh shade of lilac..great for Spring and Summer..I love it and will order again..</li>
            <li> Misleading picture. Not worth the money. The picture makes it seem like you get more then what you do. Go to wal mart and buy some wet and wild lipstick. You get one tube of lipstick and it&#x27;s very sheer like a gloss. Don&#x27;t waste your cash.</li>
            <li> GREAT pigment , love the colors , love the moisture. Love the price. I own 36 colors of this lipstick . I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> more of a purple than a pink unlike the picture.</li>
            <li> Love the color it really is creamy wish I wasn&#x27;t but it very pigmented and a beautiful color I do recommended</li>
            <li> This lipstick was not very smooth and was like chalk on my lips. It made my lips look ashy. Not the look I was going for. There was no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; or glide at all. it was as if the product was dried out or old.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SPRING! APPLY REALLY EASY AND SMOOTH , ......LAST FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS .....PROBABLY LONGER WITH A LIP PRIMER ,THIS IS NIT MATTE ,AND MATTE LIPSTICKS LAST LONGER TO ME BUT YOU CAN REAPPLY AND MIX WITH YOUR MATTE LIPSTICKS NOT BAD AT ALL</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this would complement ANY skin tone. It&#x27;s not really either pink or purple, more of a chalk/purplish gray. I had ordered this online because this color NYX lipstick had been unavailable at my local stockist for months but it was a different color to that of the tester I had seen in the store, even though it looks to be the same product and has the same color name and number. (I don&#x27;t know if the formulation was maybe changed).  I even went back to the store to do a comparison between the two and they were very different. The texture of the lipstick though was nice and creamy and it would have been great had the color not been disappointing. No issues however with seller who shipped the product lighting fast.</li>
            <li> I though I was getting all the colors because of the pictures then after I bought it I noticed it was only one lol that&#x27;s my fault for not reading but I love the color its very pretty more of a spring color but its a great deal love nyx products! and it got here two days after I bought it !</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORSE LIPSTICK EVER I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.</li>
            <li> faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaave . dupe for macs nicki viva glam 2 (:</li>
            <li> NYX has always been one of my favorite brands. I have one of every color in these round lipsticks. The colors are extremely creamy and they last a fair amount of time. These colors are used to compare to a cheap version or MAC colors. They have so many colors to choose from, and the color you see on the stick itself, is the color that&#x27;s going to be on your lips. You run into colors that look completely different on skin, than on the stick, but these colors are very true to how they look. I&#x27;m always trying and experimenting with new makeup, and NYX lipsticks are my top choice.</li>
            <li> This lipstick smells terrible, like old playdoh, it has almost no staying power, and a greasy texture. I absolutely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very creamy color that has good intense and noticeable pigmentation. Wipes off pretty easily, sadly</li>
            <li> This is a great color, it looks pink in the tube but it is more of a lavender. This is a great dupe for Mac&#x27;s Lavender whip! Goes on creamy and smooth and last for hours! I only had to re apply this once, after I ate lunch. This does not dry my lips at all or cause any irritation. the price of this is super cheap but the quality is amazing. Purples might seem like a scary color but it is for sure wearable anywhere. I love all of nyx cosmetics but this is a super gem! I will post pics and edit this shorty.</li>
            <li> This color is not at all like expected.  It doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone, and I&#x27;m a white female with pretty average skin.  It makes you appear washed out and is not at all like pictured.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, went on with such ease and complete coverage. Will be making another purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, this lipstick is true to color and has a nice texture . I LOVE it !</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth.. But color looks like something to paint a wall with... not for lipstick unfortunately.</li>
