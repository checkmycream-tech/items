            <li>the product does no damage to the hair at all, and in fact leaves it in better codition that you started with. 2)</li>
            <li>I love the Surya line...</li>
            <li>My hair is shining, healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worthwhile for the convenience.</li>
            <li>you have any questions feel free to ask me!~</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but it sure got softer and shiner.  </li>
            <li>It covered my gray better than the rinse I was using.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will use it again.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Wish the company had better resources for information about colors and blends.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels afterwards though.</li>
            <li>I would love to know about competitors, but</li>
            <li>bought it, tried it and love it.</li>
            <li>I used for years until I read in Bottom Line that I might be endangering my health by using it, so I stopped and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But - DON&amp;#34;T ever order from this seller - Vita King!d and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on lovely and looks great leaving hair VERY soft.</li>
            <li>My grays are covered quite beautifully and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>Using the product was a lovely experience and the product left my hair beautiful, healthy and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have brown hair w/ highlights and used and liked the light brown color...stay away from anything with the name &#x27;golden&#x27; in it!</li>
            <li>Works great on graying hair, creating natural looking highlights through out.</li>
            <li>It fades VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one was incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, healthier alternative...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so this solution has been successful and is easy to apply, wear a shower cap for 30 minutes, wash out, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I also put a bit on a fine brush and use it on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>You can do 20-25 min after 2-3 weeks since your previous touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to sum up, this stuff is great!, but it is not a permanent color.  </li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t color my greys, so it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>According to the instructions, 30 minutes gives light brown hair and 45 minutes gives reddish brown.</li>
            <li>It is so much better golden brown</li>
            <li>I ordered Light Brown Surya Brasil Henna Cream.</li>
            <li>I believe this is what the chart calls &amp;#34;Burgundy.&amp;#34; I have been using Surya Brasil Henna Cream Light Brown for about two years and ALWAYS</li>
            <li>EXCEPT it has light purple cast.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, it gives me rich, natural looking color and beautifully soft hair.  </li>
            <li>Great color - covered grey,</li>
            <li>Enjoy this mild to the scalp product.</li>
            <li>all you do is apply it to clean hair, cover your head with the plastic cap that&#x27;s included, and time it.  </li>
            <li>This brand has many more color choices than the Lush brand too.</li>
            <li>(the more natural the better) and wash your hair twice weekly than this color will stay the full six weeks.</li>
            <li>My hair gradually lightens as I wash it, which is actually kind of nice because I get to enjoy the full color range from dark brunette to ash brunette!  </li>
            <li>and it provides beautiful, natural hair color without chemicals and added natural benefits for scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>After a dozen shampoos, my hair wasn&#x27;t getting much lighter--but it was turning even more orange.</li>
            <li>The gloves and cap they give you are really flimsy, so go to the beauty supply store and get some better gloves and caps.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it is so ashy in some areas that it seems to have a cool, greyish sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t light brown but is instead a very ashy light burgundy.  </li>
            <li>That was a very pleasant change from my usual hair color right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>First time I did light brown</li>
            <li>This product is very promising!</li>
            <li>i used henna light brown for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I suspect they had been sitting on the shelf too long, because the boxes I&#x27;ve gotten through Amazon have done a really good job.  </li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li>The most natural looking color you will ever get in a bottle!  </li>
            <li>the color is gorgeous, soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>- maybe it&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the bottle inside the box is kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might try Golden Brown again, too.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my &amp;#34;personal blend&amp;#34; of this and Surya golden brown for about 12 years.</li>
            <li>so it makes it look even more natural).</li>
            <li>after rinsing the dye out i didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner, hair feels extremely soft and shiny, brushes easily.  </li>
            <li>The color this leaves on my dark-blonde hair is very nice, and despite my grays, it colors rather evenly, which is saying a lot since I have colored my hair with a lot of different types of products in the last year.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m very gray at the top, roots really showed, so I decided to go to a lighter brown with new applications.</li>
            <li>First time out, I used conventional hair color (Natural Instincts); the color was great</li>
            <li>Clairol worked for ONE shampoo but only with one hour and gray magic.</li>
            <li>It took experimenting with 4 colors to find that Light Brown was a replicate of my natural color.</li>
            <li>I used the Surya dark brown once and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>A pretty color, but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the dark and light brown and pleased with both.</li>
            <li>However, the results are very diappointing!</li>
            <li>I like  this better than regular hair color</li>
            <li>but I think I should mention that on my hair it appears greenish the first day.</li>
            <li>This was my first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the cream</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I have no allergic reaction to this.</li>
            <li>I did everything exactly as I always do.</li>
            <li>- was almost exactly how my hair looked BEFORE I dyed it -</li>
            <li>led me down many, many, many roads because I&#x27;m not ready to be gray yet.</li>
            <li>I thought it was because I was out in the sun right after, but next time got more, absolute purple.</li>
            <li>No mess, no mixing, fantastic color.</li>
            <li>Hair is left super soft and grays are covered (for the most part).</li>
            <li>The golden brown is pretty initially for my light brown hair, but it fades out quickly so as not to be cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously not going to be gray right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several colors, but had the greatest success with light brown to cover grey for at least 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The box, which is identical to all the other boxes of this product I have ever had, said the color in the enclosed bottle was Light Brown, but the color I got when I put it on my hair was a light PURPLE.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to apply by myself.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how quickly this product shipped to me, and it was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>And, because my hair is short and fine, one bottle of the product gives me two applications.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I bought it on the reccomendation of my mom, who has much finer, greyer hair than I do.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have all the toxins in it</li>
            <li>I think I look absolutely</li>
            <li>found this dye from Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Where I was really white,the color glistens.</li>
            <li>this cream henna is so much easier to use than the powder henna.</li>
            <li>It really covers the gray.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I find that if you use a gentle shampoo and a moisturing conditioner</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very unsatisified.</li>
            <li>This is totally unacceptable and very embarassing for me when I joined friends, used to seeing my hair a very natural-looking light brown, and they asked me what happened to my hair.</li>
            <li>The product also colors your hair in a way that looks much more natural than traditional dye.</li>
            <li>Washed out to a medium brown, but natural looking and kept color much better than commercial dyes - to my surprise.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a lot of trouble to make your own color solution using powder and distilled water and letting it sit for hours...and two solutions were involved, meaning two mixing requirements.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using regular dies, though its not 100% natural either.</li>
            <li>My roots were as prominent with Surya as with any other dye, but because Surya fades fast, the line was not rigid.</li>
            <li>and she says it covers her greys better than any other product.  </li>
            <li>I know how to follow the instructions and when I used the product sent to me from Amazon, I did as I usually do - followed the instructions perfectly - put the cream on my hair, put on the little bonnet, set my timer and waited for 60 minutes, and washed the cream out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to wash the inky creme residue off my hands in under 30 seconds and was surprised to learn that henna effect lasted twice as long in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Over the last three years, I have developed a strong allergic reaction to hair color - both in the salon and what you buy over the counter.</li>
            <li>Hair more dark auburn,</li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with the dark brown.  </li>
            <li>To make a very long story short, I became incredibly allergic to conventional hair dye.</li>
            <li>I did leave it on for and hour and a half just to make sure it took.</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t last too long or completely cover the whit haire, it does give it a nice blend with the non grays.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m too young to be silver yet!!)  </li>
            <li>Washing your hair with a stripping shampoo and washing more that a few times a week will strip any coloring whether this glorious product or some toxic store bought brands.</li>
            <li>Used it while pregnant to avoid extra chemicals even though some reviews say its not as natural.</li>
            <li>At first it was slight, and I limited it by blending golden brown and light brown.</li>
            <li>i kept it on for 3 hours, to make the color really sink in , and it came out nice dark brown ( i expected that it would be darker</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a new box at home at the moment, and I don&#x27;t remember if there are \\&quot;use by\\&quot; type dates on them, but if not, I think there should be.</li>
            <li>But the second time, the result of the new application, over new gray and previous light brown was a definite strong lavender.</li>
            <li>At this point, I don&#x27;t know if I should wait for the color to fade or try again with a light red color (possibly another</li>
            <li>(though until recently I had used the darker &amp;#34;chocolate brown&amp;#34;  so light brown could be different).  </li>
            <li>Your hair will be shiny and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>but after a few washings definitely a pleasant dark brown.</li>
            <li>I left it in the first time for the recommended length of time.  </li>
            <li>If that were possible, I would rate my experience using Surya Cream as &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; but the resulting color as &amp;#34;poor.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed my hair a hundred times over the years, but this was my first attempt at using henna to dye my hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; This was true only when I wanted the color to last.</li>
            <li>The trade off for the complete lack of damage and very soft color is...</li>
            <li>A shame since my initial experience was so positive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 70% gray; my original color was dark brown.</li>
            <li>Wow its really nice, The only down fall it washes off when you shower 7 to 8 washes only.. I will buy again......</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have the unattractive distinction with the roots being the color of your natural hair.</li>
            <li>I called and was told that the dye doesn&#x27;t completely wash out of gray hair and that the orange was unavoidable once I stopped dyeing.</li>
            <li>I will return the remainder to wild by nature.</li>
            <li>I contacted Surya directly who advised me to contact the seller as the formula has not changed, but the storage conditions of the seller could adversely affect the product.  </li>
            <li>(i was a platinum blond for about 5 years, and my natural color is medium brown)</li>
            <li>and i would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to treat and color the hair at once.  </li>
            <li>know that it isn&#x27;t 100% natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-not 100% natural</li>
            <li>My hair was getting very silver (over 50%) when I decided to bring it back the color of my youth (brown).  </li>
            <li>I have bought Surya Henna Cream at health food stores, and they have often not covered my white hairs very well at all.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>my natural color, I don&#x27;t have to fuss over where it goes</li>
            <li>My hair always looks natural and shiny, no roots, no chemical damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 90 percent gray in my early 40s, so</li>
            <li>Second, I really like the color.</li>
            <li>I saved about $3 per box less than what my health food store charges, but I guess it&#x27;s true what they say -</li>
            <li>After the first day, that hue dulls a bit.</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition after using the product, which was not the case with the conventional hair color, which left my hair dry and straw-like.  </li>
            <li>fading if I&#x27;m slow to re-dye is good because it means the line between roots and dyed isn&#x27;t so stark.  </li>
            <li>I wanted when I started looking for dyes in pharmacies but could not get from any of the &amp;#34;semi-permanent&amp;#34; or permanent major brands</li>
            <li>Re: the frequent claim that Surya leaves no skunk line, that can only be true if you&#x27;re covering very little gray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>My hair is off white, naturally.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for nice color, no more grays and most importantly, no more pain!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works on other hair colors, but from the perspective of someone with almost completely silver hair, I highly recommend Surya Henna.</li>
            <li>However, I fear that the time will come when the gray is no longer limited to around my face so that I will either have to have someone else apply it in order to get even coverage of the hair I can&#x27;t see - or worse - I&#x27;ll have to switch to a dye because  henna itself won&#x27;t adequately cover the gray, or last long enough to make the effort worthwhile.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t anything like what I expected when I bought the product at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Within the last month, I could not find my plastic gloves and instead applied the creme with my bare hands.  </li>
            <li>This did NOTHING, no color and no grey coverage</li>
            <li>If you know a truly natural product that will cover grey with no ammonia and peroxide please let me know..</li>
            <li>I tried the ash blonde hoping to cover some grey and blend roots while my hair grows out to natural I lightened it and it was damaged.</li>
            <li>I used \\&quot;Dark Brown\\&quot; last time, and might go back to it because the color of my white hairs turned out less red than the Light Brown.  </li>
            <li>The first container was fine, but all of the other 3 were so runny as to be useless.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than traditional hair dye, because it is less toxic but also because the hair loses the color gradually.</li>
            <li>little in the bottle for whole head application</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for those of us who want permanent color - if you get the color on the label!</li>
            <li> Perfect color, perfect instructions</li>
            <li> It is the best non-commercial non-chemical product I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> Used to be awesome product.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the color result as well.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful no damage at all and no chemical smells.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job with hair that is turning gray.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Some of their products work great, some dont.</li>
            <li> I welcome your questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color was great.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS GOOD</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I thought I didn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, the color is great, no adverse reaction, and it also conditions my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a type of henna dye that is safe for mehndi, and I am pleased to say that this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and shiny and my experienced hairdresser could not tell that I was using a hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I am very satisfied with it for now.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful and rich in the beggining and washes out gradually.  </li>
            <li> This is very light weight and is good for inbetween Color the Gray Henna treatments I use.  </li>
            <li> I received it today and used it and the color is really nice with my skin tone and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> That tells it&#x27;s own story.</li>
            <li> if it doesnt&#x27; wash out too fast, it&#x27;s a perfect product!</li>
            <li> works nicely  :)</li>
            <li> dye is usually wonderful and results in a very natural looking color - so much better than the L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> It works well for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on their hair but still wants to look good!</li>
            <li> the product does no damage to the hair at all, and in fact leaves it in better codition that you started with. 2)</li>
            <li> I love the Surya line...</li>
            <li> My hair is shining, healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worthwhile for the convenience.</li>
            <li> you have any questions feel free to ask me!~</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but it sure got softer and shiner.  </li>
            <li> It covered my gray better than the rinse I was using.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will use it again.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Wish the company had better resources for information about colors and blends.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels afterwards though.</li>
            <li> I would love to know about competitors, but</li>
            <li> bought it, tried it and love it.</li>
            <li> I used for years until I read in Bottom Line that I might be endangering my health by using it, so I stopped and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But - DON&amp;#34;T ever order from this seller - Vita King!d and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on lovely and looks great leaving hair VERY soft.</li>
            <li> My grays are covered quite beautifully and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> Using the product was a lovely experience and the product left my hair beautiful, healthy and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have brown hair w/ highlights and used and liked the light brown color...stay away from anything with the name &#x27;golden&#x27; in it!</li>
            <li> Works great on graying hair, creating natural looking highlights through out.</li>
            <li> It fades VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one was incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, healthier alternative...</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so this solution has been successful and is easy to apply, wear a shower cap for 30 minutes, wash out, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I also put a bit on a fine brush and use it on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> You can do 20-25 min after 2-3 weeks since your previous touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to sum up, this stuff is great!, but it is not a permanent color.  </li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t color my greys, so it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> According to the instructions, 30 minutes gives light brown hair and 45 minutes gives reddish brown.</li>
            <li> It is so much better golden brown</li>
            <li> I ordered Light Brown Surya Brasil Henna Cream.</li>
            <li> I believe this is what the chart calls &amp;#34;Burgundy.&amp;#34; I have been using Surya Brasil Henna Cream Light Brown for about two years and ALWAYS</li>
            <li> EXCEPT it has light purple cast.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, it gives me rich, natural looking color and beautifully soft hair.  </li>
            <li> Great color - covered grey,</li>
            <li> Enjoy this mild to the scalp product.</li>
            <li> all you do is apply it to clean hair, cover your head with the plastic cap that&#x27;s included, and time it.  </li>
            <li> This brand has many more color choices than the Lush brand too.</li>
            <li> (the more natural the better) and wash your hair twice weekly than this color will stay the full six weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair gradually lightens as I wash it, which is actually kind of nice because I get to enjoy the full color range from dark brunette to ash brunette!  </li>
            <li> and it provides beautiful, natural hair color without chemicals and added natural benefits for scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> After a dozen shampoos, my hair wasn&#x27;t getting much lighter--but it was turning even more orange.</li>
            <li> The gloves and cap they give you are really flimsy, so go to the beauty supply store and get some better gloves and caps.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it is so ashy in some areas that it seems to have a cool, greyish sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t light brown but is instead a very ashy light burgundy.  </li>
            <li> That was a very pleasant change from my usual hair color right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> First time I did light brown</li>
            <li> This product is very promising!</li>
            <li> i used henna light brown for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I suspect they had been sitting on the shelf too long, because the boxes I&#x27;ve gotten through Amazon have done a really good job.  </li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> The most natural looking color you will ever get in a bottle!  </li>
            <li> the color is gorgeous, soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> - maybe it&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bottle inside the box is kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might try Golden Brown again, too.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my &amp;#34;personal blend&amp;#34; of this and Surya golden brown for about 12 years.</li>
            <li> so it makes it look even more natural).</li>
            <li> after rinsing the dye out i didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner, hair feels extremely soft and shiny, brushes easily.  </li>
            <li> The color this leaves on my dark-blonde hair is very nice, and despite my grays, it colors rather evenly, which is saying a lot since I have colored my hair with a lot of different types of products in the last year.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m very gray at the top, roots really showed, so I decided to go to a lighter brown with new applications.</li>
            <li> First time out, I used conventional hair color (Natural Instincts); the color was great</li>
            <li> Clairol worked for ONE shampoo but only with one hour and gray magic.</li>
            <li> It took experimenting with 4 colors to find that Light Brown was a replicate of my natural color.</li>
            <li> I used the Surya dark brown once and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> A pretty color, but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the dark and light brown and pleased with both.</li>
            <li> However, the results are very diappointing!</li>
            <li> I like  this better than regular hair color</li>
            <li> but I think I should mention that on my hair it appears greenish the first day.</li>
            <li> This was my first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the cream</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I have no allergic reaction to this.</li>
            <li> I did everything exactly as I always do.</li>
            <li> - was almost exactly how my hair looked BEFORE I dyed it -</li>
            <li> led me down many, many, many roads because I&#x27;m not ready to be gray yet.</li>
            <li> I thought it was because I was out in the sun right after, but next time got more, absolute purple.</li>
            <li> No mess, no mixing, fantastic color.</li>
            <li> Hair is left super soft and grays are covered (for the most part).</li>
            <li> The golden brown is pretty initially for my light brown hair, but it fades out quickly so as not to be cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously not going to be gray right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several colors, but had the greatest success with light brown to cover grey for at least 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The box, which is identical to all the other boxes of this product I have ever had, said the color in the enclosed bottle was Light Brown, but the color I got when I put it on my hair was a light PURPLE.</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to apply by myself.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how quickly this product shipped to me, and it was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> And, because my hair is short and fine, one bottle of the product gives me two applications.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought it on the reccomendation of my mom, who has much finer, greyer hair than I do.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have all the toxins in it</li>
            <li> I think I look absolutely</li>
            <li> found this dye from Whole Foods</li>
            <li> Where I was really white,the color glistens.</li>
            <li> this cream henna is so much easier to use than the powder henna.</li>
            <li> It really covers the gray.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I find that if you use a gentle shampoo and a moisturing conditioner</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very unsatisified.</li>
            <li> This is totally unacceptable and very embarassing for me when I joined friends, used to seeing my hair a very natural-looking light brown, and they asked me what happened to my hair.</li>
            <li> The product also colors your hair in a way that looks much more natural than traditional dye.</li>
            <li> Washed out to a medium brown, but natural looking and kept color much better than commercial dyes - to my surprise.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a lot of trouble to make your own color solution using powder and distilled water and letting it sit for hours...and two solutions were involved, meaning two mixing requirements.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than using regular dies, though its not 100% natural either.</li>
            <li> My roots were as prominent with Surya as with any other dye, but because Surya fades fast, the line was not rigid.</li>
            <li> and she says it covers her greys better than any other product.  </li>
            <li> I know how to follow the instructions and when I used the product sent to me from Amazon, I did as I usually do - followed the instructions perfectly - put the cream on my hair, put on the little bonnet, set my timer and waited for 60 minutes, and washed the cream out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to wash the inky creme residue off my hands in under 30 seconds and was surprised to learn that henna effect lasted twice as long in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Over the last three years, I have developed a strong allergic reaction to hair color - both in the salon and what you buy over the counter.</li>
            <li> Hair more dark auburn,</li>
            <li> I have had much better luck with the dark brown.  </li>
            <li> To make a very long story short, I became incredibly allergic to conventional hair dye.</li>
            <li> I did leave it on for and hour and a half just to make sure it took.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last too long or completely cover the whit haire, it does give it a nice blend with the non grays.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too young to be silver yet!!)  </li>
            <li> Washing your hair with a stripping shampoo and washing more that a few times a week will strip any coloring whether this glorious product or some toxic store bought brands.</li>
            <li> Used it while pregnant to avoid extra chemicals even though some reviews say its not as natural.</li>
            <li> At first it was slight, and I limited it by blending golden brown and light brown.</li>
            <li> i kept it on for 3 hours, to make the color really sink in , and it came out nice dark brown ( i expected that it would be darker</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a new box at home at the moment, and I don&#x27;t remember if there are \\&quot;use by\\&quot; type dates on them, but if not, I think there should be.</li>
            <li> But the second time, the result of the new application, over new gray and previous light brown was a definite strong lavender.</li>
            <li> At this point, I don&#x27;t know if I should wait for the color to fade or try again with a light red color (possibly another</li>
            <li> (though until recently I had used the darker &amp;#34;chocolate brown&amp;#34;  so light brown could be different).  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be shiny and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> but after a few washings definitely a pleasant dark brown.</li>
            <li> I left it in the first time for the recommended length of time.  </li>
            <li> If that were possible, I would rate my experience using Surya Cream as &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; but the resulting color as &amp;#34;poor.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed my hair a hundred times over the years, but this was my first attempt at using henna to dye my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This was true only when I wanted the color to last.</li>
            <li> The trade off for the complete lack of damage and very soft color is...</li>
            <li> A shame since my initial experience was so positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 70% gray; my original color was dark brown.</li>
            <li> Wow its really nice, The only down fall it washes off when you shower 7 to 8 washes only.. I will buy again......</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have the unattractive distinction with the roots being the color of your natural hair.</li>
            <li> I called and was told that the dye doesn&#x27;t completely wash out of gray hair and that the orange was unavoidable once I stopped dyeing.</li>
            <li> I will return the remainder to wild by nature.</li>
            <li> I contacted Surya directly who advised me to contact the seller as the formula has not changed, but the storage conditions of the seller could adversely affect the product.  </li>
            <li> (i was a platinum blond for about 5 years, and my natural color is medium brown)</li>
            <li> and i would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to treat and color the hair at once.  </li>
            <li> know that it isn&#x27;t 100% natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-not 100% natural</li>
            <li> My hair was getting very silver (over 50%) when I decided to bring it back the color of my youth (brown).  </li>
            <li> I have bought Surya Henna Cream at health food stores, and they have often not covered my white hairs very well at all.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> my natural color, I don&#x27;t have to fuss over where it goes</li>
            <li> My hair always looks natural and shiny, no roots, no chemical damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 90 percent gray in my early 40s, so</li>
            <li> Second, I really like the color.</li>
            <li> I saved about $3 per box less than what my health food store charges, but I guess it&#x27;s true what they say -</li>
            <li> After the first day, that hue dulls a bit.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition after using the product, which was not the case with the conventional hair color, which left my hair dry and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> fading if I&#x27;m slow to re-dye is good because it means the line between roots and dyed isn&#x27;t so stark.  </li>
            <li> I wanted when I started looking for dyes in pharmacies but could not get from any of the &amp;#34;semi-permanent&amp;#34; or permanent major brands</li>
            <li> Re: the frequent claim that Surya leaves no skunk line, that can only be true if you&#x27;re covering very little gray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> My hair is off white, naturally.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for nice color, no more grays and most importantly, no more pain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works on other hair colors, but from the perspective of someone with almost completely silver hair, I highly recommend Surya Henna.</li>
            <li> However, I fear that the time will come when the gray is no longer limited to around my face so that I will either have to have someone else apply it in order to get even coverage of the hair I can&#x27;t see - or worse - I&#x27;ll have to switch to a dye because  henna itself won&#x27;t adequately cover the gray, or last long enough to make the effort worthwhile.</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t anything like what I expected when I bought the product at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Within the last month, I could not find my plastic gloves and instead applied the creme with my bare hands.  </li>
            <li> This did NOTHING, no color and no grey coverage</li>
            <li> If you know a truly natural product that will cover grey with no ammonia and peroxide please let me know..</li>
            <li> I tried the ash blonde hoping to cover some grey and blend roots while my hair grows out to natural I lightened it and it was damaged.</li>
            <li> I used \\&quot;Dark Brown\\&quot; last time, and might go back to it because the color of my white hairs turned out less red than the Light Brown.  </li>
            <li> The first container was fine, but all of the other 3 were so runny as to be useless.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than traditional hair dye, because it is less toxic but also because the hair loses the color gradually.</li>
            <li> little in the bottle for whole head application</li>
            <li> I was also told that the orange I got when dyeing regularly was the result of dyeing too often (which was necessary due to rapid fading), even though the instruction sheet says Surya \\&quot;can be used frequently with no time</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve read on other pages, the color does take a day or two to finish processing (naturally)</li>
            <li> the only question is how long it will last, but i don&#x27;t have any greys yet</li>
            <li> It adequately covers the gray for me, and doesn&#x27;t have the fake look of dyed hair because the different strands have the variation of natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Unlike some people, when I purchase a new product I&#x27;m not familiar with, I use it according to the instructions only; just as I did with this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> it didnt smell bad, which is a big difference from drugstore colors, and was nice and creamy to put on.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair so amazingly soft after coloring and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic hair product that restored my natural hair color, did not use harsh or toxic chemicals like lead acetate, and did not leave an unnatural looking orange or cherry red glow.  </li>
            <li> BEWARE the independent seller, VITA-KING, on Amazon who sent me the WRONG color dye - in the right box!</li>
            <li> , without fail, had it result in dying my hair Light Brown.</li>
            <li> It colors grey hair well but does stain hats or anything that you would perspire in.</li>
            <li> and i have long hair.</li>
            <li> The grey hair colors into auburn highlights.  </li>
            <li> (trying to only get roots) because re-dying the same hair doesn&#x27;t result in waves of color eventually going black rather than the intended color..</li>
            <li> It may not last as long as some  other products</li>
            <li> The first professional I consulted about the transition refused to touch my hair; he said the only solution was cutting it all off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother to send the other unopen bottles back to the seller, because I have to pay for the return shipping fee.</li>
            <li> And third, it has covered my grays as well as other products I have tried with PPD.</li>
            <li> BUT IT DOES NOT STAY ON VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> When I started using this my hair was so dry and thinning.</li>
            <li> After 4 washings my hair would be a different shade, going from about a 5 to a 4 in conventional dye terms.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lush Brand henna, but my color was out of stock, so I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I usually use it once a week, but I only leave it in for ten minutes during a one-week touch up.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little harder to apply to your hair (and that may just be because I&#x27;m not used to it), and you have to leave it on your hair for 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> i use it to mask some of my grey hair!!!  </li>
            <li> There is no terrible smell and no itching or anything bad like that.</li>
            <li> I find that the Chocolate brown works to eradicate the greenish tones since it has a very slight red tinge to it.</li>
            <li> Still, very little color was left in my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I think having that slight red tone neutralizes the green.</li>
            <li> I have been using for years as other products have burned my scalp causing peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be trying their other products.</li>
            <li> the other hair color products have.</li>
            <li> My mom, however, has lots of greys, and she&#x27;s been using surya in chocolate and mahogany (mixed) for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to PPD and all the other stuff they put in hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a four is because the bottle is small</li>
            <li> but I had a reaction to the chemicals (extreme dizziness/nausea).  </li>
            <li> It does wear off fast, but that means the worst that can happen is grey streaks coming through (which looks cool</li>
            <li> new formula does not cover grey even after 1 hour under heat cap - and it is a weird violet color.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Just like conventional hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of dark brown shoes</li>
            <li> She has dark brown hair with a reddish/mahogany shine, and she&#x27;s been raving about this henna.  </li>
            <li> now that i have decided to go dark</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was getting so thin so decided to try using a natural hair dye instead of theses chemical ones with ammonia in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to ingredients in conventional hair dye and have found other henna products to be messy and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, the color is odd.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight auburn tint on my hair, but I like it.</li>
            <li> i used some synthetic dyes first, cuz i was afraid that putting henna on blond hair would make me orange.  </li>
            <li> I have always had long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some of you would only leave it in for a few minutes, but I do know if you leave it on at least an hour</li>
            <li> YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-APPLY IT EVERY FEW DAYS.</li>
            <li> never use again - waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Messy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I have been researching my options and came across a few online forums where this product was recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a shock after really feeling so bad about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was the cap or the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Henna powder in the past.</li>
            <li> so I had it done at my salon where I&#x27;d gotten it done in the past.</li>
            <li> There was something wrong with the cream in the box I was sent, and I am returning that box and the second, unopened, box I ordered to the seller for a refund - and NEVER ordering this product from this Amazon seller - VITA-KING again!</li>
            <li> With this variable of freshness it is hard to compare the tints.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color was NOT what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It applies thick, covers and blends well.  </li>
            <li> and I have shoulder length hair and its not too thick.</li>
            <li> Surya henna dye tends to fade slowly as the weeks go on</li>
            <li> Expensive compared to other henna products, but easier to use than the powder which you have to mix.</li>
            <li> He explained that standard color correction is indeed impossible after using this product.</li>
            <li> Last, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;developer,&amp;#34; meaning fewer nasty odors and chemicals, and you can use later any portion you don&#x27;t use in one session.  </li>
            <li> I left the color on for the recommended time, and you can&#x27;t even tell that I colored it. :(</li>
            <li> recommendation to you is that you take the time to do a swatch test on some hairs you&#x27;ve collected from your brush or drain and think very hard about how the color will look all over your head before you take the plunge.</li>
            <li> But the dye does not contain PPD and other bad stuff that causes cancer and disease.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I was so distraught over it that I was literally having panic attacks night after night and crying like mad.</li>
            <li> and then one night while I had the dye on my hair, I felt a burning sensation in my lungs, I became quite light-headed and felt faint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-too expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting progressively worse and is incredibly painful and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Afraid that I would have to abandon hair coloring and return to silver, I did some online research and learned about henna.  </li>
            <li> and it itched like mad-</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now, and it has never given me bad color or hurt my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I felt so bad about my hair.  </li>
            <li> bad they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, it brought out the orange in my grays.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Used during pregnancy. Got the job done...covered gray hair. Just apply, put cap on, then a wool hat over shower cap to insulate some heat and set for about an hour. Hair is left super soft and grays are covered (for the most part). I have brown hair w/ highlights and used and liked the light brown color...stay away from anything with the name &#x27;golden&#x27; in it!</li>
            <li> Enjoy this mild to the scalp product. I have been using for years as other products have burned my scalp causing peeling.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job with hair that is turning gray. I like it better than traditional hair dye, because it is less toxic but also because the hair loses the color gradually. You don&#x27;t have the unattractive distinction with the roots being the color of your natural hair. This product just dissolves gradually. It works well for someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on their hair but still wants to look good! The product also colors your hair in a way that looks much more natural than traditional dye. You still have all the different highlights of your regular hair. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> O produto e bom  e  facil de usar , qualquer pessoa em casa pode aplicar . A unica coisa que nao gostei e que a tinta  nao tem uma durabilidade  maior para com os fios brancos do cabelo . Eu recomendo  as pessoas que nao tem fios do cabelo branco .</li>
            <li> This was a god-send from traditional henna mud pack.  This is very light weight and is good for inbetween Color the Gray Henna treatments I use.  Goes on lovely and looks great leaving hair VERY soft.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair.  I left it in the first time for the recommended length of time.  When I saw that there were no results, and it all just washed out, I left it in twice the length of time.  Still, very little color was left in my hair.  I have a pair of dark brown shoes and I now use it to polish them.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS GOOD BUT IT DOES NOT STAY ON VERY LONG. YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-APPLY IT EVERY FEW DAYS.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of gray, Surya Cream is probably not for you. It fades VERY quickly. I&#x27;m about 70% gray; my original color was dark brown. After 4 washings my hair would be a different shade, going from about a 5 to a 4 in conventional dye terms. Re: the frequent claim that Surya leaves no skunk line, that can only be true if you&#x27;re covering very little gray. My roots were as prominent with Surya as with any other dye, but because Surya fades fast, the line was not rigid. Worst of all, it brought out the orange in my grays. At first it was slight, and I limited it by blending golden brown and light brown. But over several months, sections of my hair became straight-up orange.    The instruction sheet says Surya is \\&quot;semipermanent...meaning the color dissipates after several washings.\\&quot; This was true only when I wanted the color to last. Once I wanted to get rid of it, I couldn&#x27;t. Having foolishly believed what I read online about Surya washing out in 7 to 9 shampoos, I stopped dyeing. After a dozen shampoos, my hair wasn&#x27;t getting much lighter--but it was turning even more orange. Twice I emailed the company for assistance at the address on the box and got no answer. I called and was told that the dye doesn&#x27;t completely wash out of gray hair and that the orange was unavoidable once I stopped dyeing. I was also told that the orange I got when dyeing regularly was the result of dyeing too often (which was necessary due to rapid fading), even though the instruction sheet says Surya \\&quot;can be used frequently with no time interval.\\&quot;    I&#x27;ve decided to go back to my natural color. The first professional I consulted about the transition refused to touch my hair; he said the only solution was cutting it all off. I then saw another pro, who will add highlights to soften the transition and partly camouflage the orange. He explained that standard color correction is indeed impossible after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years. I was looking for an organic hair product that restored my natural hair color, did not use harsh or toxic chemicals like lead acetate, and did not leave an unnatural looking orange or cherry red glow.  My hair is healthy and shiny and my experienced hairdresser could not tell that I was using a hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the last month, I could not find my plastic gloves and instead applied the creme with my bare hands.  I was able to wash the inky creme residue off my hands in under 30 seconds and was surprised to learn that henna effect lasted twice as long in my hair.  Instead of applying the creme weekly, I am now applying it bi-monthly saving both time and money.</li>
            <li> I tried the ash blonde hoping to cover some grey and blend roots while my hair grows out to natural I lightened it and it was damaged. This did NOTHING, no color and no grey coverage and it itched like mad- I&#x27;m not sure if this was the cap or the product. I will return the remainder to wild by nature. If you know a truly natural product that will cover grey with no ammonia and peroxide please let me know.. none of them seem to work for me. Clairol worked for ONE shampoo but only with one hour and gray magic. ugh!!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I tried this product at the same time, we got the same result, which is the color doesn&#x27;t stay at all, not to mention to cover the gray. I don&#x27;t even bother to send the other unopen bottles back to the seller, because I have to pay for the return shipping fee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several colors, but had the greatest success with light brown to cover grey for at least 4 weeks.  The golden brown is pretty initially for my light brown hair, but it fades out quickly so as not to be cost effective.  I&#x27;m allergic to permanent hair dye so this solution has been successful and is easy to apply, wear a shower cap for 30 minutes, wash out, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  Edit:  The first container was fine, but all of the other 3 were so runny as to be useless.  I contacted Surya directly who advised me to contact the seller as the formula has not changed, but the storage conditions of the seller could adversely affect the product.  Too expensive to have so many failures.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, it gives me rich, natural looking color and beautifully soft hair.  The trade off for the complete lack of damage and very soft color is...It doesn&#x27;t last long.  I usually use it once a week, but I only leave it in for ten minutes during a one-week touch up.  If I skip a week, I leave it in for 20 minutes.  I also put a bit on a fine brush and use it on my eyebrows.  My initial use, I left the color in for about 25 minutes.  The gloves and cap they give you are really flimsy, so go to the beauty supply store and get some better gloves and caps.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now, and it has never given me bad color or hurt my hair at all.  I bought it on the reccomendation of my mom, who has much finer, greyer hair than I do.  She loves it as well, but like me she has to use it weekly for the color to stay looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantages with the Surya creme henna are - 1) the product does no damage to the hair at all, and in fact leaves it in better codition that you started with. 2) the color is gorgeous, soft and natural looking. 3) there are no roots, as the color fades (and all color does, even permenant chemical dyes) you have no visible line where the color went on initially.  Your biggest disadvantage is - weekly or semi-weekly touch ups.  DO NOT leave the color on for 25 minutes on a weekly touch-up, only for about 10 minutes.  You can do 20-25 min after 2-3 weeks since your previous touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to sum up, this stuff is great!, but it is not a permanent color.  If you don&#x27;t expect it to act like a permanent color, you&#x27;ll be very, very happy.</li>
            <li> I started using Surya Henna liquid about 2 years ago to cover my increasingly gray hair.  It took experimenting with 4 colors to find that Light Brown was a replicate of my natural color. So I am very satisfied with it for now. It adequately covers the gray for me, and doesn&#x27;t have the fake look of dyed hair because the different strands have the variation of natural hair color. It lasts about 6 weeks when washing the hair about every 2-3 days. There is enough of the henna in 1 bottle to do a touch-up of the gray about 3 weeks into an application. It is easy enough to apply by myself. However, I fear that the time will come when the gray is no longer limited to around my face so that I will either have to have someone else apply it in order to get even coverage of the hair I can&#x27;t see - or worse - I&#x27;ll have to switch to a dye because  henna itself won&#x27;t adequately cover the gray, or last long enough to make the effort worthwhile. It&#x27;s too soon to tell.    I tried Surya Henna powder once, but threw it out after mixing it because it looked too gritty.</li>
            <li> I used the Surya dark brown once and was very pleased. Hair more dark auburn, but after a few washings definitely a pleasant dark brown. Washed out to a medium brown, but natural looking and kept color much better than commercial dyes - to my surprise. Since I&#x27;m very gray at the top, roots really showed, so I decided to go to a lighter brown with new applications. First time I did light brown it was fine. But the second time, the result of the new application, over new gray and previous light brown was a definite strong lavender. I thought it was because I was out in the sun right after, but next time got more, absolute purple. A pretty color, but not what I was looking for. When I called company, the US rep  couldn&#x27;t tell me anything about why that might have happened, but did have in her notes that gold or goden blonde should neutralize purple. So - company have neutralize-purple instructions. That tells it&#x27;s own story. Have no idea how often this happens - maybe it&#x27;s rare. A shame since my initial experience was so positive. I&#x27;ll probably try the darker brown again if I can ever get rid of the purple. By the way, as someone above mentioned, don&#x27;t count on this being temporary color. Great for those of us who want permanent color - if you get the color on the label!</li>
            <li> i use it to mask some of my grey hair!!!  works nicely  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some of you would only leave it in for a few minutes, but I do know if you leave it on at least an hour it lasts 2 - 3 months.  I love the Surya line...I&#x27;ve tried the dark and light brown and pleased with both.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and it provides beautiful, natural hair color without chemicals and added natural benefits for scalp and hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not TOUCH my grays. Even after using entire bottle!</li>
            <li> The color this leaves on my dark-blonde hair is very nice, and despite my grays, it colors rather evenly, which is saying a lot since I have colored my hair with a lot of different types of products in the last year.  I wish it would last longer (even though I leave it on for an hour or two each time), but I wish that about all temporary hair products.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, perfect instructions</li>
            <li> This product is very promising! Even comes with a plastic shower cap, plastic gloves and instructions; unlike, the powdered henna. However, the results are very diappointing! Unlike some people, when I purchase a new product I&#x27;m not familiar with, I use it according to the instructions only; just as I did with this product. According to the instructions, 30 minutes gives light brown hair and 45 minutes gives reddish brown. I left the product in for 45 minutes and my hair hadn&#x27;t changed AT ALL. I certainy will not purchase this again. Dont believe the HYPE people!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last too long or completely cover the whit haire, it does give it a nice blend with the non grays.  This product leaves my hair so amazingly soft after coloring and less frizzy.  I&#x27;m going to be trying their other products.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. No mess, no mixing, fantastic color. My hair is shining, healthy and radiant. Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like  this better than regular hair color and I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have all the toxins in it the other hair color products have.</li>
            <li> i have heard about this color brand for a while from my mom.  She has dark brown hair with a reddish/mahogany shine, and she&#x27;s been raving about this henna.  now that i have decided to go dark (i was a platinum blond for about 5 years, and my natural color is medium brown) i used some synthetic dyes first, cuz i was afraid that putting henna on blond hair would make me orange.  now after i have darkened my hair i used henna light brown for the first time.  it didnt smell bad, which is a big difference from drugstore colors, and was nice and creamy to put on.  i kept it on for 3 hours, to make the color really sink in , and it came out nice dark brown ( i expected that it would be darker then the box indicates). after rinsing the dye out i didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner, hair feels extremely soft and shiny, brushes easily.  the only question is how long it will last, but i don&#x27;t have any greys yet and i would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to treat and color the hair at once.  My mom, however, has lots of greys, and she&#x27;s been using surya in chocolate and mahogany (mixed) for the past 3 years and she says it covers her greys better than any other product.  bottom line- if it doesnt&#x27; wash out too fast, it&#x27;s a perfect product!</li>
            <li> Expensive compared to other henna products, but easier to use than the powder which you have to mix.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the best non-commercial non-chemical product I have ever used.  Your hair will be shiny and very natural looking.  It colors grey hair well but does stain hats or anything that you would perspire in.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t stay,  save your money and buy another product.</li>
            <li> The product requires you to leave it on for over an hour an then the color only lasts a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to ingredients in conventional hair dye and have found other henna products to be messy and cumbersome to use. This one was incredibly easy to use and I was pleased with the results. It may not last as long as some  other products but it&#x27;s worthwhile for the convenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a type of henna dye that is safe for mehndi, and I am pleased to say that this stuff is perfect. I received it today and used it and the color is really nice with my skin tone and it looks amazing. The only downside is that the bottle inside the box is kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions feel free to ask me!~</li>
            <li> Some of their products work great, some dont.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my sideburns to cover up the greys. It applies thick, covers and blends well.  I also like the fact that the dye comes premixed.</li>
            <li> It is so much better golden brown</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this stuff.  When I started using this my hair was so dry and thinning. I felt so bad about my hair.  I have always had long thick hair.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was getting so thin so decided to try using a natural hair dye instead of theses chemical ones with ammonia in them. I can&#x27;t say my hair got thicker because of this but it sure got softer and shiner.  I have even had 2 people complimenting me on my hair.  What a shock after really feeling so bad about it.  I would recommended it to everyone!  It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone trying to cover gray.  It covered my gray better than the rinse I was using.  I love it and will use it again.</li>
            <li> To make a very long story short, I became incredibly allergic to conventional hair dye. I had been using Colorsilk by Revlon for years and then one night while I had the dye on my hair, I felt a burning sensation in my lungs, I became quite light-headed and felt faint. Looking back on it, these symptoms had been building but I ignored them and thought it was all in my head. It really wasn&#x27;t!! I&#x27;m allergic to PPD and all the other stuff they put in hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;This led me down many, many, many roads because I&#x27;m not ready to be gray yet. I&#x27;m still in my 30&#x27;s! I researched hair chalking, coffee and tea dyes, henna etc. And I was so distraught over it that I was literally having panic attacks night after night and crying like mad. To a lot of people, going gray is no big deal, but NOT FOR ME!! I&#x27;m seriously not going to be gray right now. I think I look absolutely terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I found this dye from Whole Foods and I decided to give it a try. I was very skeptical but, IT WORKED!! HOLY COW!&lt;br /&gt;I know that it isn&#x27;t 100% natural. After reading some reviews here and discovering that bit of info, I am so thankful for that knowledge. But the dye does not contain PPD and other bad stuff that causes cancer and disease.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even apply it like I was supposed to and it still worked. It did not stain my scalp either. My grays are covered quite beautifully and my hair feels soft. Where I was really white,the color glistens. And the best part, I&#x27;m not allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-too little in the bottle for whole head application&lt;br /&gt;-too expensive&lt;br /&gt;-not 100% natural&lt;br /&gt;-fades quicker than I would like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please ask! I welcome your questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After months of using this henna I would still give it 5 stars but I think I should mention that on my hair it appears greenish the first day. After the first day, that hue dulls a bit. I find that the Chocolate brown works to eradicate the greenish tones since it has a very slight red tinge to it. It&#x27;s still brown but I think having that slight red tone neutralizes the green.</li>
            <li> this cream henna is so much easier to use than the powder henna. The color was great.</li>
            <li> since this is not chemical you can save left overs for another time!! i used mine twice and i have long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is off white, naturally.  I didn&#x27;t want to use amonia products so decided to use this product and it worked like a charm.  It does fade but just touch up and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> This was my first time I used this product. When I tried it. It really covers the gray. Wow its really nice, The only down fall it washes off when you shower 7 to 8 washes only.. I will buy again......thanks</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how quickly this product shipped to me, and it was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately this color was NOT what I expected it to be. I left the color on for the recommended time, and you can&#x27;t even tell that I colored it. :(</li>
            <li> I really like this. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a four is because the bottle is small so I actually needed to have used two bottles and I have shoulder length hair and its not too thick. There is no terrible smell and no itching or anything bad like that. I did leave it on for and hour and a half just to make sure it took. I did notice tiny bit of the color coming off my gray but not allot...I&#x27;ll take that over applying damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, healthier alternative...</li>
            <li> My hair was getting very silver (over 50%) when I decided to bring it back the color of my youth (brown).  (I&#x27;m too young to be silver yet!!)  First time out, I used conventional hair color (Natural Instincts); the color was great but I had a reaction to the chemicals (extreme dizziness/nausea).  Afraid that I would have to abandon hair coloring and return to silver, I did some online research and learned about henna.  I was about to try a powdered henna product...till I read the instructions.  It seemed like a lot of trouble to make your own color solution using powder and distilled water and letting it sit for hours...and two solutions were involved, meaning two mixing requirements.  Then I found Surya Henna.  It&#x27;s already mixed...all you do is apply it to clean hair, cover your head with the plastic cap that&#x27;s included, and time it.  Just like conventional hair color.  As of this review, I have used this product twice and I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, the color is great, no adverse reaction, and it also conditions my hair.  My hair is in better condition after using the product, which was not the case with the conventional hair color, which left my hair dry and straw-like.  My hair gradually lightens as I wash it, which is actually kind of nice because I get to enjoy the full color range from dark brunette to ash brunette!  And, because my hair is short and fine, one bottle of the product gives me two applications.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I don&#x27;t know how it works on other hair colors, but from the perspective of someone with almost completely silver hair, I highly recommend Surya Henna.</li>
            <li> I wish I could write two separate reviews for this product.  If that were possible, I would rate my experience using Surya Cream as &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; but the resulting color as &amp;#34;poor.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed my hair a hundred times over the years, but this was my first attempt at using henna to dye my hair.  I want to say that this product has no odor, whatsoever.  That was a very pleasant change from my usual hair color right off the bat.  Second, this color didn&#x27;t sting my scalp at all (unlike commercial, chemical hair dyes).  Using the product was a lovely experience and the product left my hair beautiful, healthy and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the color is odd.  I think &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; is the best way to describe it.  It isn&#x27;t light brown but is instead a very ashy light burgundy.  In fact, it is so ashy in some areas that it seems to have a cool, greyish sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read on other pages, the color does take a day or two to finish processing (naturally) but this isn&#x27;t anything like what I expected when I bought the product at my local Whole Foods.  (Yes, I did try this on a sample of my hair before applying it to my entire head, but I think the swatch was a bit deceiving.)  At this point, I don&#x27;t know if I should wait for the color to fade or try again with a light red color (possibly another brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation to you is that you take the time to do a swatch test on some hairs you&#x27;ve collected from your brush or drain and think very hard about how the color will look all over your head before you take the plunge.</li>
            <li> Used to be awesome product. Great color - covered grey, IF you used heat cap.&lt;br /&gt;This new formula does not cover grey even after 1 hour under heat cap - and it is a weird violet color.&lt;br /&gt;Will never use again - waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;This is from a user who used to buy it by the case for years.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Gave white hair a pink/purple tint.  I have had much better luck with the dark brown.  Wish the company had better resources for information about colors and blends.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t color my greys, so it&#x27;s just fine.  Love how my hair feels afterwards though.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lush Brand henna, but my color was out of stock, so I tried this brand. Because it&#x27;s pre-mixed, it&#x27;s far easier to use than Lush, but still messy. I was very happy with the color result as well. This brand has many more color choices than the Lush brand too.</li>
            <li> I like it... I use it every 3 weeks... the color is beautiful and rich in the beggining and washes out gradually.  It&#x27;s better than using regular dies, though its not 100% natural either.</li>
            <li> The most natural looking color you will ever get in a bottle!  Works great on graying hair, creating natural looking highlights through out. People can&#x27;t believe I do it myself.  Starts to fade after about 3-4 weeks, but by then the roots have grown out anyway, so it&#x27;s time to color again.</li>
            <li> I have bought Surya Henna Cream at health food stores, and they have often not covered my white hairs very well at all.  I suspect they had been sitting on the shelf too long, because the boxes I&#x27;ve gotten through Amazon have done a really good job.  I used \\&quot;Dark Brown\\&quot; last time, and might go back to it because the color of my white hairs turned out less red than the Light Brown.  I might try Golden Brown again, too.  With this variable of freshness it is hard to compare the tints.  I don&#x27;t have a new box at home at the moment, and I don&#x27;t remember if there are \\&quot;use by\\&quot; type dates on them, but if not, I think there should be.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful no damage at all and no chemical smells. I find that if you use a gentle shampoo and a moisturing conditioner (the more natural the better) and wash your hair twice weekly than this color will stay the full six weeks.Washing your hair with a stripping shampoo and washing more that a few times a week will strip any coloring whether this glorious product or some toxic store bought brands. I have been using this product for at least five years and am very happy and satisified with the golden blonde color it leaves on those horrible greys. It does leave your hair soft and silky. I will never use a another!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Messy to wash off. Stains your clothes for several weeks until the color runs out. Laundry takes care of it. Used it while pregnant to avoid extra chemicals even though some reviews say its not as natural.</li>
            <li> It changes the color of my whites without re-setting (just covering and gradually fading) my natural color, I don&#x27;t have to fuss over where it goes (trying to only get roots) because re-dying the same hair doesn&#x27;t result in waves of color eventually going black rather than the intended color..&lt;br /&gt;The fading if I&#x27;m slow to re-dye is good because it means the line between roots and dyed isn&#x27;t so stark.  Longer hairs don&#x27;t easily go to white but a lighter brown, resulting in the streaked effect I wanted when I started looking for dyes in pharmacies but could not get from any of the &amp;#34;semi-permanent&amp;#34; or permanent major brands (though until recently I had used the darker &amp;#34;chocolate brown&amp;#34;  so light brown could be different).  Last, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;developer,&amp;#34; meaning fewer nasty odors and chemicals, and you can use later any portion you don&#x27;t use in one session.  I would love to know about competitors, but so fare Surya is the only brand I know that does this for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Henna powder in the past. This was my first time using the cream and I&#x27;m very unsatisified. It DID NOT cover the gray. I thought I didn&#x27;t do a good job so I had it done at my salon where I&#x27;d gotten it done in the past. DID NOT work at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using my &amp;#34;personal blend&amp;#34; of this and Surya golden brown for about 12 years. My hair always looks natural and shiny, no roots, no chemical damage. It does wear off fast, but that means the worst that can happen is grey streaks coming through (which looks cool: I&#x27;m well over 50 so it makes it look even more natural). I use it every 3 weeks, but since it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, and I do it at home while I am doing laundry or whatever, that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> Over the last three years, I have developed a strong allergic reaction to hair color - both in the salon and what you buy over the counter. It&#x27;s getting progressively worse and is incredibly painful and uncomfortable. I&#x27;m almost 90 percent gray in my early 40s, so I have been researching my options and came across a few online forums where this product was recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it, tried it and love it. First and foremost, I have no allergic reaction to this. Second, I really like the color. It has a slight auburn tint on my hair, but I like it. And third, it has covered my grays as well as other products I have tried with PPD. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little harder to apply to your hair (and that may just be because I&#x27;m not used to it), and you have to leave it on your hair for 60 minutes. But, you just throw on a shower cap, and spend the hour doing whatever you need to do around the house. Overall, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for nice color, no more grays and most importantly, no more pain!</li>
            <li> It does not damage my hair but it also does not cover white Hair.</li>
            <li> Ad said organics ingredients, however did not receive the same product</li>
            <li> BEWARE the independent seller, VITA-KING, on Amazon who sent me the WRONG color dye - in the right box! I ordered Light Brown Surya Brasil Henna Cream. The box, which is identical to all the other boxes of this product I have ever had, said the color in the enclosed bottle was Light Brown, but the color I got when I put it on my hair was a light PURPLE. I believe this is what the chart calls &amp;#34;Burgundy.&amp;#34; I have been using Surya Brasil Henna Cream Light Brown for about two years and ALWAYS, without fail, had it result in dying my hair Light Brown. I know how to follow the instructions and when I used the product sent to me from Amazon, I did as I usually do - followed the instructions perfectly - put the cream on my hair, put on the little bonnet, set my timer and waited for 60 minutes, and washed the cream out of my hair. I did everything exactly as I always do. Imagine my surprise when I looked in the mirror! Surya henna dye tends to fade slowly as the weeks go on and I dye my  hair (which is white) about once a month or 5 weeks. What I got - after dying my hair with the cream send to me by the Amazon seller  - was almost exactly how my hair looked BEFORE I dyed it - EXCEPT it has light purple cast. This is totally unacceptable and very embarassing for me when I joined friends, used to seeing my hair a very natural-looking light brown, and they asked me what happened to my hair. There was something wrong with the cream in the box I was sent, and I am returning that box and the second, unopened, box I ordered to the seller for a refund - and NEVER ordering this product from this Amazon seller - VITA-KING again! I saved about $3 per box less than what my health food store charges, but I guess it&#x27;s true what they say - you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;This dye is usually wonderful and results in a very natural looking color - so much better than the L&#x27;Oreal I used for years until I read in Bottom Line that I might be endangering my health by using it, so I stopped and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;But - DON&amp;#34;T ever order from this seller - Vita King!d and began using Surya Brasil Henna Cream, and I have bee extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;But - DON&amp;#34;T ever order from this seller - Vita King!</li>
            <li> Conditions hair at the same time as colors.  The grey hair colors into auburn highlights.  Only lasts 2 to 3 weeks</li>
