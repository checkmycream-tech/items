            <li>It has worked great on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was a great iron until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>otherwise, functionality is great.</li>
            <li>a good quality straightener</li>
            <li>I had used a chi before which I liked</li>
            <li>but this one is still really nice.</li>
            <li>it glides threw my hair nicely</li>
            <li>Thanks again, IM A VERY HAPPY customer!!!!....</li>
            <li>It advertises it is suppose to be better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The best thing about this flat iron is that it is very, VERY light.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron...heats up fast and straightens great!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much and the way it was send to me by mail was very nice AND ON TIME.....</li>
            <li>They are usually pretty good when it comes to styling tools</li>
            <li>but I think this makes my hair more smooth</li>
            <li>I would purchase another one but honestly if it is going to break again it isn&#x27;t worth my money.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this glides right through without pulling.</li>
            <li>It is light yet sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Since it is relatively light and could fall off the counter if you accidentally hit the cord, for instance, I bought a metal kitchen utensil holder (in houseware section) for $4 so that I can store it vertically on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>I have had it for almost a year and the only reason I got it was because my hair stylist said it was great.</li>
            <li>It does straighten my hair pretty easily if I section it appropriately.</li>
            <li>The flat iron works great.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of straightening her long wavy hair and leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice flat Iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- heats up quickly</li>
            <li>no digital indicator which would have make it more cool</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend to get my money back.</li>
            <li>very responsible people, I recommend</li>
            <li>Pulled my hair and did not get as hot.  </li>
            <li>i like the blue hair straightener better.</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>i was hoping that it would atleast have a flat iron keep bag to keep the product safe and also it looks</li>
            <li>but there are many other out there half the price with equally good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle can get a little warm.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast, goes very close to the scalp</li>
            <li>Heat up fast</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Red color is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;- long plates to handle more hairs in one go</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All of my friends love my new RED flat iron.</li>
            <li>The iron straightened my hair well, but it gets really hot on the outside of the iron and near the handle where you pick it up.  </li>
            <li>My stylist uses these iron in the blue color and I can get my hair as straight as she does.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 18 yr old daughter for Christmas.  </li>

            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality of this iron considering it was a Babyliss product.</li>

            <li> i love this flat iron. It has worked great on my hair. I had used a chi before which I liked but I think this makes my hair more smooth</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair, so I set it at about 300 degrees.  The handle can get a little warm.  I wish it had an auto on instead of turning it on every day.  It does straighten my hair pretty easily if I section it appropriately.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, goes very close to the scalp</li>
            <li> The iron straightened my hair well, but it gets really hot on the outside of the iron and near the handle where you pick it up.  I am returning the item for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this iron.  It is light yet sturdy.  I actually bought it for my daughter but find myself borrowing it every day.  No complaints whatsoever. Since it is relatively light and could fall off the counter if you accidentally hit the cord, for instance, I bought a metal kitchen utensil holder (in houseware section) for $4 so that I can store it vertically on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could beat my Chi, boy I was wrong this iron is awesome!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good! Heat up fast My hair looks so shiny and smooth I recomend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the same as the blue Babyliss pro flat iron 1\\&quot;. It advertises it is suppose to be better. Oh no it is NOT!!!!! Pulled my hair and did not get as hot.  Dont waste your $$$$.</li>
            <li> i have been using straighteners for all my life now, i have got four different straighteners in the course of last 8 years and this was the most expensive one i bought. i was hoping that it would atleast have a flat iron keep bag to keep the product safe and also it looks neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a good quality straightener but there are many other out there half the price with equally good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Red color is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;- long plates to handle more hairs in one go&lt;br /&gt;- temperature controlled&lt;br /&gt;- heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- a little over priced&lt;br /&gt;- no keep bag&lt;br /&gt;- no digital indicator which would have make it more cool&lt;br /&gt;- auto on/off should have been included in this price.</li>
            <li> It was a great iron until it stopped working. I have had it for almost a year and the only reason I got it was because my hair stylist said it was great. She had only had hers for a few months. I have had irons work up to 3 years and this is my fist that broke on me two months ago. It was a steal at $60 but now it is $130. I would purchase another one but honestly if it is going to break again it isn&#x27;t worth my money. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> very responsible people, I recommend</li>
            <li> I figured it would be like the blue one and was just red but it isnt. i like the blue hair straightener better. but this one is still really nice. it glides threw my hair nicely but thats cuz i use a heat protectant and its small like my old one, which makes things less of a change...but all in all i like the hair straightened</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality of this iron considering it was a Babyliss product. They are usually pretty good when it comes to styling tools but they missed the mark with this one. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend to get my money back. I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> This is a very nice flat Iron. The best thing about this flat iron is that it is very, VERY light. All of my friends love my new RED flat iron. Thank you so much and the way it was send to me by mail was very nice AND ON TIME.....Thanks again, IM A VERY HAPPY customer!!!!.... :)</li>
            <li> Great flat iron...heats up fast and straightens great! I have thick course hair and I have no complaints. My stylist uses these iron in the blue color and I can get my hair as straight as she does.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works great. I have very fine hair, and this glides right through without pulling. I like the specific temperature settings, as well. The only problem I had was the description said red babyliss flat iron, but I did not receive a \\&quot;red\\&quot; one...otherwise, functionality is great.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 18 yr old daughter for Christmas.  She has extremely long, thick hair and just loves the way this straightens it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it. It does a great job of straightening her long wavy hair and leaving it silky smooth. Only wish it had automatic shut-off.</li>
