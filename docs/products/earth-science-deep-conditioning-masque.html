            <li>i have never found a product as good as this!</li>
            <li>So, my beautiful, earthy friend Elizabeth leaves something in my house every time she comes.</li>
            <li>Would be a great 10-30 minute masque.</li>
            <li>it s a great product.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Honest!</li>
            <li>The shampoo however isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Loved the way my hair felt after I using it.</li>
            <li>I have turned my friends on to it by giving them a bottle, it is that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite potent and is best used sparingly, which makes it all the more good value.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do anything exceptional and</li>
            <li>super soft&lt;br /&gt;and smells great!</li>
            <li>A bonus is that it smells great and is a fraction of the price of the famous Macadamia hair masque.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing conditioner ever!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but I can already tell I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I came across a travel size in a health food store and before I finished it I was ordering more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried them all but this one is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>My hair when it&#x27;s done feels so amazing</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to make my own with avocado, olive oil, etc…</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re mixed curly, like me, you&#x27;ll be especially pleased with how well this hydrates and tames locks into smooth, and delightfully fragranced perfection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have heat damaged hair that is very fine and fried at the ends and a semi-oily scalp.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>To get more effect from this, let it sit on your hair for more then the suggested 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a week, and it keeps my hair healthy, and shiny.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>but it is better than most grocery-aisle products of comparable cost.</li>
            <li>But others may have had a better experience.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I found it cheap online and decided to give it a shot!</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair so silky and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and they discontinued it at the market I used to buy it at.  </li>
            <li>My favorite of the Earth Science hair care collection.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li>Great Hair Mask, highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The best part is it is plant based and not full of hazardous chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hairdressers have always said, Olive Oil, Avacado Oil, or Coconut Oil are 3 of the best products to use on dry hair.</li>
            <li>but so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great, soft, and conditioned after this.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many professional products over the years having a cosmetology license and this works just as good or better then some of them out there.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I didn&#x27;t have the other masque to compare it to (which was absolutely great), I would have liked it better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a deep conditioning treatment that is as good as this!</li>
            <li>Great price and keeps my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a medium-thick consistency and it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out and apply throughout all of my hair.</li>
            <li>It tangles so easily, without any effort.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Make your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My my hair feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>this is a great second option.  </li>
            <li>This was a fabulous find.</li>
            <li>All hair types win with this deep conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my hair look shiny and healthy, and the very first day I used it a work associate commented on how good my hair looked and how I should wear it down more often.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and really makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Whole foods has it for much more.</li>
            <li>It is also much more inexpensive compared to the John Master&#x27;s Lavender and Avocado Intense Conditioner</li>
            <li>It has really helped my hair look more like</li>
            <li>(A little longer shower always feels good anyway!)</li>
            <li>I ended up with super kinky hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is also pretty dry so this mask was a great solution.</li>
            <li>Good for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing , does a very good job conditioning my fine limp hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it!!</li>
            <li>It made my hair super soft, I cant stop touching it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deep conditioner!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my unsuccessful Kerastase experience I was kind of burned on trying hair masques, especially as they tend to be pricey, but then I stumbled on a trial size tube of this Earth Science product at Wholefoods and decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY, it is made of magic and it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, but after washing with it my hair almost immediately got more tangled and had a filmy, almost oily finish without actually conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff, it has the consistancy of Pantene, but it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li>Makes my unruley hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, leaves hair soft like butter.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and perfumey, but I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Not only is it all natural and cruelty-free, it is simply a superior product.</li>
            <li>I have used their products before and only good experiences so far.</li>
            <li>If I were a nice friend or if she did not live across an ocean, I would return them to her.</li>
            <li>You only need just a dime size and it covers the hair, my hair looks great and I get compliments when I use this and then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I really only need to use it on my dry ends to get great results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal self without the super frizz.  </li>
            <li>The one I received from Amazon is authentic and exactly the same as what I bought from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased as it went a long way to reversing what I thought would be irreversible damage.</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is thick, clean, and smells nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smelled strongly of perfumes and left my hair looking blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 40s with fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to the salon brands I used to buy.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover my hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>My husband likes it so much that he started using it too.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than at Wholefoods, where it costs around twenty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair</li>
            <li>I have thicker, straight hair</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s Sold at Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s convient for me to purchase on here.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost to my waist and it is very curly</li>
            <li>This product, along with the shampoo, makes my hair so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I have used expensive conditioners like kerastase, redkin, and pureology and this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>Does not weight your hair down, even very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, tangle free and smooth, not sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I could live without it!</li>
            <li>I have spent $$$ on high-end conditioners and nothing leaves my hair as soft and healthy as this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone to purchase and use this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and this conditioner works great.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I have bought this conditioner from Whole Foods, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair about every 6-8 weeks and live in the south where the sun can play havoc on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have found my new DC.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I have long, coarse, wavy hair and this conditioner makes my hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this conditioner to several friends and they&#x27;ve had similar success with it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the exact same product, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>One treatment and my hair was soft and luxurious!</li>
            <li>SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods!</li>
            <li>This is the first hair masque I ever used, I was a little leery about using it because I tend to have an oily scalp while most people using hair masques appear to have dry hair from researching Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>When I use it, I make sure to keep it on a little longer than my regular conditioners to let it penetrate all through my hair.</li>
            <li>I discovered the Earth Science conditioning masque at a natural food market and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this deep conditioning hair masque.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hairing feeling silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair SO soft.</li>
            <li>Hair felt soft and tanglefree, just what one would want from a hair mask.</li>
            <li>And I actually don&#x27;t need too much for my waist length hair, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>It helps me to detangle my hair and it leaves my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It makes it shiny, soft, and I swear it literally heals split ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and it looks like it&#x27;s just long and kind of thin, but it&#x27;s deceptively thick.</li>
            <li>I tried all my existing products and bought several new products like hot oil treatments with no success.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of expensive salon products, and this conditioner is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even though I thought I used a bit too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>I didnt smell anything when applying it, which is a good and bad thing.</li>

            <li> It goes on smoothly, but after washing with it my hair almost immediately got more tangled and had a filmy, almost oily finish without actually conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff, it has the consistancy of Pantene, but it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li> Makes my unruley hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, leaves hair soft like butter.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong and perfumey, but I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Not only is it all natural and cruelty-free, it is simply a superior product.</li>
            <li> I have used their products before and only good experiences so far.</li>
            <li> If I were a nice friend or if she did not live across an ocean, I would return them to her.</li>
            <li> You only need just a dime size and it covers the hair, my hair looks great and I get compliments when I use this and then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I really only need to use it on my dry ends to get great results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal self without the super frizz.  </li>
            <li> The one I received from Amazon is authentic and exactly the same as what I bought from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased as it went a long way to reversing what I thought would be irreversible damage.</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is thick, clean, and smells nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smelled strongly of perfumes and left my hair looking blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s with fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to the salon brands I used to buy.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> My husband likes it so much that he started using it too.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than at Wholefoods, where it costs around twenty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair</li>
            <li> I have thicker, straight hair</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s Sold at Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s convient for me to purchase on here.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost to my waist and it is very curly</li>
            <li> This product, along with the shampoo, makes my hair so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive conditioners like kerastase, redkin, and pureology and this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li> Does not weight your hair down, even very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, tangle free and smooth, not sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I could live without it!</li>
            <li> I have spent $$$ on high-end conditioners and nothing leaves my hair as soft and healthy as this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone to purchase and use this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this conditioner works great.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought this conditioner from Whole Foods, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair about every 6-8 weeks and live in the south where the sun can play havoc on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have found my new DC.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, wavy hair and this conditioner makes my hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this conditioner to several friends and they&#x27;ve had similar success with it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the exact same product, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> One treatment and my hair was soft and luxurious!</li>
            <li> SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> This is the first hair masque I ever used, I was a little leery about using it because I tend to have an oily scalp while most people using hair masques appear to have dry hair from researching Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I make sure to keep it on a little longer than my regular conditioners to let it penetrate all through my hair.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Earth Science conditioning masque at a natural food market and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioning hair masque.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hairing feeling silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair SO soft.</li>
            <li> Hair felt soft and tanglefree, just what one would want from a hair mask.</li>
            <li> And I actually don&#x27;t need too much for my waist length hair, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It helps me to detangle my hair and it leaves my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It makes it shiny, soft, and I swear it literally heals split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and it looks like it&#x27;s just long and kind of thin, but it&#x27;s deceptively thick.</li>
            <li> I tried all my existing products and bought several new products like hot oil treatments with no success.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of expensive salon products, and this conditioner is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even though I thought I used a bit too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair</li>
            <li> I didnt smell anything when applying it, which is a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried that its macadamia nut and avocado oil base would weigh down my hair, but it rinses right out, leaving my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair very soft, manageable, and it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> A new hairdresser combed my extremely curly hair while it was mostly dry but still damp enough to damage it severely be stretching it out.</li>
            <li> so having said that this won&#x27;t last me too long if I were to plan on using it once a week to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically treated, and can feel really dry and fragile if not well-conditioned.  </li>
            <li> i cannot live without this conditioner as I have thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had very weak hair that falls out &amp; breaks apart easy due to hypothyroidism disease and wanted to experiment with hair treatments.)</li>
            <li> and it usually takes an excessive amount of conditioner to moisturize my hair enough so that it isn&#x27;t dry and tangled, but with this product I only have to use about a dime size to condition my whole head.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It tends to get dry at the ends and oily at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The added bonus is you only need a little bit, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily conditioner rather than a hair masque, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Having extremely dry and color-treated hair, I&#x27;ve used several more expensive, less eco-friendly conditioners in the past.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair, so it gets very dry.</li>
            <li> tip for curly hair - comb hair out with a wide tooth comb while this is still in the hair -</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> that a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it too, even from my hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I use it just about every other day.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is a small tube.</li>
            <li> had been using an expensive, $40 a pot product by Kerastase with little success.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fragile hair that I color regularly.  </li>
            <li> The directions suggest using it occasionally and leaving it on for at least 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair about a month a half ago to a red color and this brightened my now dull color.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and use a very small amount of this product at a time.</li>
            <li> and I will have a mess of tangles.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly, AA hair</li>
            <li> When I seen the little bottle, and price, and I was thinking I would go through this stuff in about a week--</li>
            <li> Plus it didn&#x27;t weight down my hair like I feared!</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for me, we have very thick Curly Hair and sometimes do the Coconut Oil Treatment on our hair for extra moisturizer</li>
            <li> This conditioner takes a few minutes to fully rinse out.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it unlocks an knots I might accumulate over a few days between washings.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my hair feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t know yet how it will improve the overall condition of my pretty miserable looking hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how often you are supposed to use this</li>
            <li> Also, my hair can be so hard to manage.</li>
            <li> It lasts at least two months.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because that salon product can&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff, which I already use regularly.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair plus it is thin and my hair just loves it.</li>
            <li> It was weird.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent condition, I recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> i cannot live without this conditioner as I have thick coarse hair.  i have never found a product as good as this! I hide it from my family.  a little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> Having extremely dry and color-treated hair, I&#x27;ve used several more expensive, less eco-friendly conditioners in the past. I discovered the Earth Science conditioning masque at a natural food market and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since. Not only is it all natural and cruelty-free, it is simply a superior product. I was initially worried that its macadamia nut and avocado oil base would weigh down my hair, but it rinses right out, leaving my hair soft and healthy. The directions suggest using it occasionally and leaving it on for at least 5 minutes but I use it daily like a regular conditioner and have never had any build-up. Another bonus is that it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to the salon brands I used to buy. I&#x27;ve recommended this conditioner to several friends and they&#x27;ve had similar success with it!</li>
            <li> Repairs, nourishes and strengthens hair inside and out. Leaves hair soft, tangle free and smooth, not sticky or weighed down. Excellent treatment.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this conditioner. I have spent $$$ on high-end conditioners and nothing leaves my hair as soft and healthy as this conditioner. And, bonus, my husband loves the scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing! You only need just a dime size and it covers the hair, my hair looks great and I get compliments when I use this and then blow dry my hair. The best part is it is plant based and not full of hazardous chemicals. I have tried many professional products over the years having a cosmetology license and this works just as good or better then some of them out there.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s with fine, color treated hair. It tends to get dry at the ends and oily at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using an expensive, $40 a pot product by Kerastase with little success. It smelled strongly of perfumes and left my hair looking blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my unsuccessful Kerastase experience I was kind of burned on trying hair masques, especially as they tend to be pricey, but then I stumbled on a trial size tube of this Earth Science product at Wholefoods and decided to give it a go. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised by the results. It made my hair look shiny and healthy, and the very first day I used it a work associate commented on how good my hair looked and how I should wear it down more often. I&#x27;ve had other compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it too, even from my hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product. It&#x27;s quite potent and is best used sparingly, which makes it all the more good value. I really only need to use it on my dry ends to get great results.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this hair masque a couple times now but so far I am happy with it. I have long, thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover my hair. This conditioner takes a few minutes to fully rinse out. It leaves the hair very soft, manageable, and it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down. To get more effect from this, let it sit on your hair for more then the suggested 5 minutes. Would be a great 10-30 minute masque.</li>
            <li> After using an avocado masque that I got during my last trip to Europe (made in the UK), I tried to find it on amazon. I didn&#x27;t find the exact same product, so I decided to give this one a try. It&#x27;s a very generic masque, not much different that any regular conditioner. Maybe if I didn&#x27;t have the other masque to compare it to (which was absolutely great), I would have liked it better. Will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  I use it when I wash my hair.  Works and the smell isn&#x27;t nauseating or chemically.</li>
            <li> Great price and keeps my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Make your hair smooth and shiny.  Recommend to everyone for the price it s a great product.  Whole foods has it for much more.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair masque. I&#x27;ve only used it once and it made my hair so soft. I have wavy to curly hair plus it is thin and my hair just loves it. My hair is also pretty dry so this mask was a great solution. I think I might use it every time I condition my hair. It is also much more inexpensive compared to the John Master&#x27;s Lavender and Avocado Intense Conditioner so I have no problem buying this product instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it didn&#x27;t do anything exceptional and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny at all.  I&#x27;ve used much better.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> My my hair feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioning hair masque. It smells amazing , does a very good job conditioning my fine limp hair without weighing it down. Some times I use it as a conditioner and some times I leave it in my hair overnight and rinse it off in the morning. I like it that a little bit goes a long way.  I have short hair and use a very small amount of this product at a time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I have curly hair and it unlocks an knots I might accumulate over a few days between washings.  Leaves my hairing feeling silky and soft.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product to use.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fragile hair that I color regularly.  I don&#x27;t have time to make my own with avocado, olive oil, etc….so this is a great second option.  My hair feels great, soft, and conditioned after this.  I use it several times a week.  I&#x27;ll keep getting it!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair SO soft. I have long, coarse, wavy hair and this conditioner makes my hair so easy to comb through. I have tried all kinds of expensive salon products, and this conditioner is by far my favorite. My husband likes it so much that he started using it too.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair about every 6-8 weeks and live in the south where the sun can play havoc on your hair. One treatment and my hair was soft and luxurious! I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have bleached hair, so it gets very dry. I use this product twice a week, and it keeps my hair healthy, and shiny. When I use it, I make sure to keep it on a little longer than my regular conditioners to let it penetrate all through my hair. (A little longer shower always feels good anyway!) It does not make my hair feel heavy or greasy. My hairdressers have always said, Olive Oil, Avacado Oil, or Coconut Oil are 3 of the best products to use on dry hair. And this conditioner has 2 out of the 3. The price is great for the miracles it does. I highly recommend anyone to purchase and use this product. You&#x27;ll be happy you did. Honest!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner out there.  I have long, thick hair and this conditioner works great.  I wish it came in a bigger size.  For the price and how it works I give it 5 stars.  I have used expensive conditioners like kerastase, redkin, and pureology and this by far is the best.  The shampoo however isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> So, my beautiful, earthy friend Elizabeth leaves something in my house every time she comes. If I were a nice friend or if she did not live across an ocean, I would return them to her. Instead, I use them! THIS treasure is the piece de resistance! This is the most amazing conditioner ever! I leave it in while I cycle through the sonicare a couple times and then rinse it out and my hair (which I tend to neglect) is like silk! The conditioner itself is thick, clean, and smells nice, but not overpowering. My hair when it&#x27;s done feels so amazing I want to roll around in it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Only used it once so far so I wouldn&#x27;t know yet how it will improve the overall condition of my pretty miserable looking hair. Loved the way my hair felt after I using it. I have fine and thin hair and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even though I thought I used a bit too much of the product.  Hair felt soft and tanglefree, just what one would want from a hair mask. I have used their products before and only good experiences so far.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Mask, highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;and much cheaper than at Wholefoods, where it costs around twenty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair super soft&lt;br /&gt;and smells great!</li>
            <li> BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY, it is made of magic and it makes your hair soft and shiny. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on an impulse... and now I&#x27;ve put it on an automatic reorder. A tiny amount leaves my hair silky and conditioned. It is no miracle elixir... but it is better than most grocery-aisle products of comparable cost. I started out using it occasionally and now it is my daily conditioner.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, but after washing with it my hair almost immediately got more tangled and had a filmy, almost oily finish without actually conditioning my hair. It was weird. But others may have had a better experience. I have thicker, straight hair but maybe someone with finer hair might experience something different.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for me, we have very thick Curly Hair and sometimes do the Coconut Oil Treatment on our hair for extra moisturizer but I love this stuff, it has the consistancy of Pantene, but it&#x27;s all natural...I&#x27;ve never felt a softer Conditioner for my hair.....This is a must to purchase on Amazon. I know it&#x27;s Sold at Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s convient for me to purchase on here.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deep conditioner. Hands down the best! The added bonus is you only need a little bit, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair masque I ever used, I was a little leery about using it because I tend to have an oily scalp while most people using hair masques appear to have dry hair from researching Amazon reviews. I bought this because I found it cheap online and decided to give it a shot! (I&#x27;ve had very weak hair that falls out &amp; breaks apart easy due to hypothyroidism disease and wanted to experiment with hair treatments.) Using it made my hair instantly become like sateen as I ran my fingers through my hair! SO SOFT! I REALLY like it!! Plus it didn&#x27;t weight down my hair like I feared! &#x3D;D This was a fabulous find. Would buy a second time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I have heat damaged hair that is very fine and fried at the ends and a semi-oily scalp. I was having the hardest time finding something that actually worked for my hair. I went through an assortment of shampoos, conditioners, and serums. Until...I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods! This product leaves your hair so silky and healthy looking. My hair looks like it has bounce to it again and it feels luxurious. People comment on my hair all the time and even reach out to touch it! I am not sure how often you are supposed to use this but I use it just about every other day. I love it! Don&#x27;t think I could live without it! A bonus is that it smells great and is a fraction of the price of the famous Macadamia hair masque.</li>
            <li> All hair types win with this deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re mixed curly, like me, you&#x27;ll be especially pleased with how well this hydrates and tames locks into smooth, and delightfully fragranced perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this, would swim in it if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip for curly hair - comb hair out with a wide tooth comb while this is still in the hair - then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glorious.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and they discontinued it at the market I used to buy it at.  Makes my unruley hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this product once but I can already tell I love it! I dyed my hair about a month a half ago to a red color and this brightened my now dull color. It made my hair super soft, I cant stop touching it. I didnt smell anything when applying it, which is a good and bad thing.I woudl definetely give this product a try!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  It works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t doubt it, buy it!!! Best stuff ever. Does not weight your hair down, even very fine hair. I have turned my friends on to it by giving them a bottle, it is that good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and really makes my hair soft. And I actually don&#x27;t need too much for my waist length hair, which is a plus. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the Earth Science hair care collection.  Good for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! I have long, thick, curly, AA hair and I use this as a deep conditioner. It helps me to detangle my hair and it leaves my hair extremely soft. The smell is pretty strong and perfumey, but I really like the scent. The scent only lasts for about a day. This conditioner has a medium-thick consistency and it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out and apply throughout all of my hair. In the past, I have bought this conditioner from Whole Foods, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it. The one I received from Amazon is authentic and exactly the same as what I bought from Whole Foods. I will be buying this conditioner from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deep conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily conditioner rather than a hair masque, but a little goes a long way.  My hair is chemically treated, and can feel really dry and fragile if not well-conditioned.  This product has rescued my mane!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, leaves hair soft like butter. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is a small tube. 6 fl oz is simply not enough of product. My hair is almost to my waist and it is very curly so having said that this won&#x27;t last me too long if I were to plan on using it once a week to moisturize my hair. This is why I gave it a 4 star versus the 5.</li>
            <li> This stuff is INCREDIBLE. No product I&#x27;ve tried has done what this does to my hair. It makes it shiny, soft, and I swear it literally heals split ends. Also it smells delicious. Never going back!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have found my new DC. I came across a travel size in a health food store and before I finished it I was ordering more! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and I refuse to use anything else. I have very long hair and it usually takes an excessive amount of conditioner to moisturize my hair enough so that it isn&#x27;t dry and tangled, but with this product I only have to use about a dime size to condition my whole head. I love it! When I seen the little bottle, and price, and I was thinking I would go through this stuff in about a week--wrong. It lasts at least two months. I only wash my hair every other day. Also, my hair can be so hard to manage. It tangles so easily, without any effort. I can literally turn my head 20 degrees and I will have a mess of tangles. My hair is very fine and it looks like it&#x27;s just long and kind of thin, but it&#x27;s deceptively thick. This product, along with the shampoo, makes my hair so much easier to manage. Also, the smell is great!</li>
            <li> A new hairdresser combed my extremely curly hair while it was mostly dry but still damp enough to damage it severely be stretching it out. I ended up with super kinky hair. I tried all my existing products and bought several new products like hot oil treatments with no success. Until I tried a tube of this. Fabulous stuff! It has really helped my hair look more like it&#x27;s normal self without the super frizz.  I am really pleased as it went a long way to reversing what I thought would be irreversible damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I recently colored my hair, including bleaching, and the lady at the beauty supply store sold me a packet of hair treatment to use afterward. I was so disappointed because that salon product can&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff, which I already use regularly. I&#x27;ve never found a deep conditioning treatment that is as good as this!</li>
            <li> The BEST Conditioner out there!  I have tried them all but this one is my favorite!  Leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
