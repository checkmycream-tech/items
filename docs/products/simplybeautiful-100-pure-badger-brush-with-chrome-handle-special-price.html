            <li>It is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>As I wrote elsewhere regarding the Tweezerman brush, I think that I received the Simply Beautiful brush either as a substitute or by mistake.</li>

            <li>a good lather and applies well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, it is a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>It has good brush.</li>
            <li>Brush worked good for a couple of months, then the brishels began to fall out.</li>
            <li>Looks good, has a lot of heft and weight, holds water well and, therefore, lathers up a storm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go out on limb here and say this   is the best $15 badger brush available.</li>
            <li>Brush is good and has not lost any hairs.  </li>
            <li>Yet, I somehow couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend even $50 on a brush unless I would have gotten some guaranty of superior performance.    </li>
            <li>It gives good lather which covers the places on face which need to be covered.</li>
            <li>I bought it with the doubt that some said its good and</li>
            <li>It has been dependable, produces a great lather, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and has a nice size.</li>
            <li>good brush and holds up well</li>
            <li>No problems with odor or ability to build a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Works well and looks good.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Someday I may splurge on a Simpson, but this is good for now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good looking brush.</li>
            <li>It looks good and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing hair (like my wood brush does).</li>
            <li>I never see anything written about the Simply Beautiful brand, but this is top drawer with me.</li>
            <li>Well, now that I have a good brush and a good soap, every morning holds the promise of a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Looks great on the stand next to my Merkur 34C. Excellent value for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>When I first received this item it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes for a lot more money, but for someone just getting into using a brush, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Weight is great, not too light, and</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job working up a great lather, and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for the price, and the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li>So re-box if you want to give someone a nice gift.</li>
            <li>It looks nice.</li>
            <li>Good weight, comfortable to hold and good looking.  </li>
            <li>It looks quite nice, and performs as well as it looks.</li>
            <li>Appearance: this brush looks nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this brush is nice and it does the job.</li>
            <li>the hairs are nice and with a medium strength to them.</li>
            <li>It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles.</li>
            <li>That one isn&#x27;t as nice nor does it lather up as well, but it sure lasted a lot longer and probably cost $2.</li>
            <li>This brush is not the best brush you can buy, for a beginner or someone that wants a decent backup/travel brush, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Good thing for not expensive cost!  </li>
            <li>There are some websites with reviews on too many brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this is not the case.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve learned from reviews, badger brush is better than synthetic or boar brush.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare it to, but I am more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.    </li>
            <li>Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer.</li>
            <li>It is much more like granddad&#x27;s in color, feel, and use.</li>
            <li>But it was bought mostly on looks alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better brushes that cost over $100 are.</li>
            <li>...does the $100 models give you winning stock tips?</li>
            <li>The handle on this brush is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this brush absorbs plenty of water and, after a good shake, really whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It holds more water and exfoliates the shin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a mug and brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>I picked the SimplyBeautiful one mostly because of the chrome handle.</li>
            <li>Moreover, my bathroom looks more sophisticated with it.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of the chrome handle.</li>
            <li>Bristles are more</li>
            <li>but for the most part this happens once a while.</li>
            <li>Forget penis envy :).....</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a bit more heft to it</li>
            <li>It has a good feel to it, just the right amount of heft.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first</li>
            <li>For $25 this is a wonderful shaving brush for those of us who prefer to really coat our beards in pure soap ,rather than chemicals and menthol, before we shave.</li>
            <li>You feel the heft, which makes it great, after a few uses, it starts filling out and spreads foam great.  </li>
            <li>This brush looks classy, has great heft in your hand and does a wonderul job.</li>
            <li>The comfort of the brush bristles are what really matter and they are quite good on this brush.</li>
            <li>THIS brush is a solid performer and fits beautifully in my rack.</li>
            <li>Drop it into your basin of hot water and let the handle warm up in seconds.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend the chrome to someone who demanded it for aesthetic purposes, it is quite beautiful and well made.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good starter brush as long as you keep your glue handy.</li>
            <li>Super Safety Razors\\&quot;, wasn&#x27;t sure from all the descriptions.</li>
            <li>Cheap glue that holds hair to handle.</li>
            <li>It produces a nice lather and was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I thought the smooth chrome might be slippery to handle while brushing on the soap but hasn&#x27;t been.  </li>
            <li>Fits on stand called \\&quot;Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from</li>
            <li>another well respected brand)â€“they are beautiful, last forever, lose a couple bristles the first time, but hardly more over extended use.</li>
            <li>Cheap oneslost bristles daily--thus one has yet to lose any.</li>
            <li>Need to note that was a cheap one which came in a set with a soap and a bowl for $12 altogether.</li>
            <li>Overall a great value.</li>
            <li>They were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I enjoy looking at it hanging from the chrome razor and brush stand (also from SimplyBeautiful) between shaves.  </li>
            <li>The handle is smooth</li>
            <li>The bristles are surprising soft.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re done shaving, two or three swings and most of the water zips right off of the brush</li>
            <li>It is an easy job to super glue them together.</li>
            <li>Compared to the original brush I purchased in 2012.</li>
            <li>The build quality could be better, but the look and feel is nice, especially for the price (under $25 on the promo I used).</li>
            <li>The bristles impart a really pleasant sensation while building lather on my face, with just enough \\&quot;prickle\\</li>
            <li>and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Very sleek and elegant.</li>
            <li>the price, at this price range you will not find such a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>Combine this with a good shaving soap (yes Virginia, $20 for one cake, but that cake will last ya.</li>
            <li>Good product using it daily.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles, full plume, and makes a really nice lather.</li>
            <li>looks great, just a little harder bristles than I expected  Slim and fits perfect in the holder I bought separately, nice looking shiny chrome</li>
            <li>but after the first week of use, does fine.  </li>
            <li>If  you&#x27;re just starting to wet-shave, you could spend a lot more money and probably not get a brush that&#x27;s appreciably better than this one.</li>
            <li>The seller refunded payment quickly, but couldn&#x27;t offer a replacement.</li>
            <li>This brush is very dense, the handle is solid and looks great.</li>
            <li>they do provide a nice feel to the face and lathering shaving cream is easy and smooth and does not leave clumps or missed spots like other cheaper brushes sometimes do.</li>
            <li>It great for a novice as well as a seasoned wet shaver.</li>
            <li>I have owned this for several months, and love it !</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot for the price, but it definitely delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush seems to work better than expected and the price was more than fare on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rare when an impulse purchase exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used the more costly badger brushes, so I&#x27;m not sure what they would give you that this one lacks, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I gave it no thought at the time and started using the brush the same day it arrived.    </li>
            <li>The materials are likely somewhat better in the more expensive brush and, I would hope, the assembly would be superb compared to the cheaper one.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice brush, well made, and a solid value for the money (I got it when it was at 19.95).</li>
            <li>I think the extra heat radiated from the handle helps keep the lather warm.    </li>
            <li>&quot; that you know its got to be doing a good job cleaning the facial oils off and helping the whiskers get fully moisturized and ready for shaving.</li>
            <li>When you push the brush against your face, it mushrooms out to put a nice swath of later all over.  </li>
            <li>It lathers ok so far.</li>
            <li>Its not like I&#x27;m using super hot water, just what is coming out of the faucet.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this item to have a higher quality I personally feel better off with my cheap boar head brush.</li>
            <li>Right out of the gate</li>
            <li>The badger on this could be a bit softer, but a good value none the less.  </li>
            <li>I thought it looked good, and I&#x27;d get a little use out of it.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time, the knot (where the bristles attach to the handle) detached from the handle</li>
            <li>It does indeed smell like a wet badger, but all the nice brushes smell this way.     </li>
            <li>By the way, it is my first brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever badger brush.  </li>
            <li>This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This was my first brush.</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to the Silvertip version and I love it too.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month and it continuously she&#x27;d more than my German Shepherd in the summer during every use.</li>
            <li>not so lathersome at first,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any smell when I first got this brush either.  </li>
            <li>Good heavy brush.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, full badger brush that simply out performs my much more expensive bush (which has been relegated to my gym bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes, but this one looks amazing, lathers well, and hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle yet (~3 months).  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done, squeeze the extra left-over lather back into your soap cup (from the brush, you dummy), if you&#x27;re using the good stuff, that will save you some money.</li>
            <li>Whoever purchased one of those babys, please weigh in, because I can&#x27;t think how those expensive ones lather much better and apply much more smoothly than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I this brush has more than met my expectations for quality and performance, and will be my go-to brush for a long time.</li>
            <li>It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad&#x27;s brush should be properly retired and I should get my own.</li>
            <li>pure badger.  </li>
            <li>Makes you wonder if it is really a Badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready&#x27;s, I looked here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Since my grandfather&#x27;s brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t made the decision to also go with the straight razor.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole safety razor set one day on amazon.</li>
            <li>It also feels very luxurious on the face and spreads the shaving foam very well.</li>
            <li>The head of the brush was cheaply glued to the chrome handle and fell off after 2 weeks moderate use.</li>
            <li>I pre-heat the brush along with my mug and soap before I make lather, and really like the way the heated brush handle feels in my hand while I&#x27;m making the lather.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>but i think thats why i really like this brush now.  </li>
            <li>handle is much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>bristles are very</li>
            <li>You can read elsewhere about just how much water to leave on the brush before creating your lather.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and quality product.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel a bit rough to the touch, but they are necessary to make a good lather with the shave soap.</li>
            <li>It is heavy, nicely felt in hand.</li>
            <li>The handle had a nice heavy feel to it and the bristles were smoothe on my face.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Handle is easy to grip even when wet and stays shiny.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this after noting the brush that was included with an apothecary style mug I ordered previously would leave hairs in my soap and didn&#x27;t fit my Col. Conk safety razor/brush rack!</li>
            <li>It looks decent.  </li>
            <li>The hairs are started to come out now at a steady rate.</li>
            <li>Oh, I&#x27;ll eventually try one of the more expensive brushes as that&#x27;s just my nature, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll be getting a lot more for my money than I&#x27;ve gotten from this brush.</li>
            <li>At one level, a brush is just a brush and any decent shaving brush will work.</li>
            <li>It holds brush well and doesn&#x27;t lose any hair when I forcibly push it into a tight brush holder.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li>at first i didn&#x27;t like this brush because the bristles were not stiff at all, in fact they are still not stiff</li>
            <li>some said its bad for my opinion its a great product!</li>
            <li>so I could start shaving my legs with the old school safety razor, and I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a much better brush and worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a complaint.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back since it took me 5 minutes to fix</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit too soft and several fell off into the box it came in before even using, and just brushing it against my hand with the same vigor you would shaving saw more loosing away.</li>
            <li>This is a nice-looking brush, but mine came apart after a year or so of hanging from a razor stand with only rare use.</li>
            <li>I think this is normal for a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to shed bristles and the chrome still looks new.</li>
            <li>The new one....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft on the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably start looking for something different pretty soon since it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s appeal.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush - it looks great and feels so in the hand, but sadly the handle is the only upgrade from the $13 Escali Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>I strongly doubt this is real badger hair, it definitely feels different than other badger and boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Basically the brush in a clear box.</li>
            <li>It will make any bathroom setup look classy.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap badger brush with a heavy chrome handle.</li>
            <li>Soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>, was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a badger shaving brush since the boar brush I have had became completely unusable after just 2 years of use.</li>
            <li>But I got used to the weight incredibly fast maybe at the second shaving.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re a beginning Mekur double-edge wet shaver like me, this is very much worth the investment.</li>
            <li>With my old shaving brush I had not only my face covered but lather would be at some unexpected places of the bathroom</li>
            <li>The bristles are quite stiff and generate a fine later quickly with very little soap.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one thatwill last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; smell - although it did eventually go away.</li>
            <li>I have seen only 1 fallen bristle from the new brush and this happened on the second week of use.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush long enough to know the difference between a $20 brush and a $200 brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine what such a price difference would buy in the way of \\&quot;real world\\&quot; performance.</li>
            <li>and you need to be careful whipping up a lather in a ceramic mug/bowl not to clank the side too hard as it&#x27;s much more likely to chip</li>
            <li>Indeed, when it came the handle seemed somewhat heavy for the first time.</li>
            <li>The spread of bristles is too wide to use in a mug or, \\&quot;normal size\\&quot; bowl like an Edwin Jagger Rn6.</li>
            <li>If you want to get into wet shaving you might as well spend the extra $20 on a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and within a month the brush fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li>When I first got the brush, it seemed a bit stiff and smelled a bit gamey.</li>
            <li>It tends to flatten out a little much while using it, but returns to the shape pictured when it dries.</li>

            <li> It has good brush.</li>
            <li> Brush worked good for a couple of months, then the brishels began to fall out.</li>
            <li> Looks good, has a lot of heft and weight, holds water well and, therefore, lathers up a storm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go out on limb here and say this   is the best $15 badger brush available.</li>
            <li> Brush is good and has not lost any hairs.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I somehow couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend even $50 on a brush unless I would have gotten some guaranty of superior performance.    </li>
            <li> It gives good lather which covers the places on face which need to be covered.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the doubt that some said its good and</li>
            <li> It has been dependable, produces a great lather, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and has a nice size.</li>
            <li> good brush and holds up well</li>
            <li> No problems with odor or ability to build a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Works well and looks good.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Someday I may splurge on a Simpson, but this is good for now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good looking brush.</li>
            <li> It looks good and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing hair (like my wood brush does).</li>
            <li> I never see anything written about the Simply Beautiful brand, but this is top drawer with me.</li>
            <li> Well, now that I have a good brush and a good soap, every morning holds the promise of a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Looks great on the stand next to my Merkur 34C. Excellent value for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> When I first received this item it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes for a lot more money, but for someone just getting into using a brush, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Weight is great, not too light, and</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job working up a great lather, and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for the price, and the price was cheap.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li> So re-box if you want to give someone a nice gift.</li>
            <li> It looks nice.</li>
            <li> Good weight, comfortable to hold and good looking.  </li>
            <li> It looks quite nice, and performs as well as it looks.</li>
            <li> Appearance: this brush looks nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this brush is nice and it does the job.</li>
            <li> the hairs are nice and with a medium strength to them.</li>
            <li> It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles.</li>
            <li> That one isn&#x27;t as nice nor does it lather up as well, but it sure lasted a lot longer and probably cost $2.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the best brush you can buy, for a beginner or someone that wants a decent backup/travel brush, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Good thing for not expensive cost!  </li>
            <li> There are some websites with reviews on too many brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is not the case.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve learned from reviews, badger brush is better than synthetic or boar brush.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but I am more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.    </li>
            <li> Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer.</li>
            <li> It is much more like granddad&#x27;s in color, feel, and use.</li>
            <li> But it was bought mostly on looks alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better brushes that cost over $100 are.</li>
            <li> ...does the $100 models give you winning stock tips?</li>
            <li> The handle on this brush is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this brush absorbs plenty of water and, after a good shake, really whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> It holds more water and exfoliates the shin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mug and brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> I picked the SimplyBeautiful one mostly because of the chrome handle.</li>
            <li> Moreover, my bathroom looks more sophisticated with it.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of the chrome handle.</li>
            <li> Bristles are more</li>
            <li> but for the most part this happens once a while.</li>
            <li> Forget penis envy :).....</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a bit more heft to it</li>
            <li> It has a good feel to it, just the right amount of heft.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first</li>
            <li> For $25 this is a wonderful shaving brush for those of us who prefer to really coat our beards in pure soap ,rather than chemicals and menthol, before we shave.</li>
            <li> You feel the heft, which makes it great, after a few uses, it starts filling out and spreads foam great.  </li>
            <li> This brush looks classy, has great heft in your hand and does a wonderul job.</li>
            <li> The comfort of the brush bristles are what really matter and they are quite good on this brush.</li>
            <li> THIS brush is a solid performer and fits beautifully in my rack.</li>
            <li> Drop it into your basin of hot water and let the handle warm up in seconds.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend the chrome to someone who demanded it for aesthetic purposes, it is quite beautiful and well made.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good starter brush as long as you keep your glue handy.</li>
            <li> Super Safety Razors\\&quot;, wasn&#x27;t sure from all the descriptions.</li>
            <li> Cheap glue that holds hair to handle.</li>
            <li> It produces a nice lather and was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I thought the smooth chrome might be slippery to handle while brushing on the soap but hasn&#x27;t been.  </li>
            <li> Fits on stand called \\&quot;Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from</li>
            <li> another well respected brand)â€“they are beautiful, last forever, lose a couple bristles the first time, but hardly more over extended use.</li>
            <li> Cheap oneslost bristles daily--thus one has yet to lose any.</li>
            <li> Need to note that was a cheap one which came in a set with a soap and a bowl for $12 altogether.</li>
            <li> Overall a great value.</li>
            <li> They were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I enjoy looking at it hanging from the chrome razor and brush stand (also from SimplyBeautiful) between shaves.  </li>
            <li> The handle is smooth</li>
            <li> The bristles are surprising soft.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re done shaving, two or three swings and most of the water zips right off of the brush</li>
            <li> It is an easy job to super glue them together.</li>
            <li> Compared to the original brush I purchased in 2012.</li>
            <li> The build quality could be better, but the look and feel is nice, especially for the price (under $25 on the promo I used).</li>
            <li> The bristles impart a really pleasant sensation while building lather on my face, with just enough \\&quot;prickle\\</li>
            <li> and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Very sleek and elegant.</li>
            <li> the price, at this price range you will not find such a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Combine this with a good shaving soap (yes Virginia, $20 for one cake, but that cake will last ya.</li>
            <li> Good product using it daily.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles, full plume, and makes a really nice lather.</li>
            <li> looks great, just a little harder bristles than I expected  Slim and fits perfect in the holder I bought separately, nice looking shiny chrome</li>
            <li> but after the first week of use, does fine.  </li>
            <li> If  you&#x27;re just starting to wet-shave, you could spend a lot more money and probably not get a brush that&#x27;s appreciably better than this one.</li>
            <li> The seller refunded payment quickly, but couldn&#x27;t offer a replacement.</li>
            <li> This brush is very dense, the handle is solid and looks great.</li>
            <li> they do provide a nice feel to the face and lathering shaving cream is easy and smooth and does not leave clumps or missed spots like other cheaper brushes sometimes do.</li>
            <li> It great for a novice as well as a seasoned wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for several months, and love it !</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot for the price, but it definitely delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush seems to work better than expected and the price was more than fare on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rare when an impulse purchase exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used the more costly badger brushes, so I&#x27;m not sure what they would give you that this one lacks, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I gave it no thought at the time and started using the brush the same day it arrived.    </li>
            <li> The materials are likely somewhat better in the more expensive brush and, I would hope, the assembly would be superb compared to the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush, well made, and a solid value for the money (I got it when it was at 19.95).</li>
            <li> I think the extra heat radiated from the handle helps keep the lather warm.    </li>
            <li> &quot; that you know its got to be doing a good job cleaning the facial oils off and helping the whiskers get fully moisturized and ready for shaving.</li>
            <li> When you push the brush against your face, it mushrooms out to put a nice swath of later all over.  </li>
            <li> It lathers ok so far.</li>
            <li> Its not like I&#x27;m using super hot water, just what is coming out of the faucet.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to have a higher quality I personally feel better off with my cheap boar head brush.</li>
            <li> Right out of the gate</li>
            <li> The badger on this could be a bit softer, but a good value none the less.  </li>
            <li> I thought it looked good, and I&#x27;d get a little use out of it.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time, the knot (where the bristles attach to the handle) detached from the handle</li>
            <li> It does indeed smell like a wet badger, but all the nice brushes smell this way.     </li>
            <li> By the way, it is my first brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever badger brush.  </li>
            <li> This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This was my first brush.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the Silvertip version and I love it too.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and it continuously she&#x27;d more than my German Shepherd in the summer during every use.</li>
            <li> not so lathersome at first,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any smell when I first got this brush either.  </li>
            <li> Good heavy brush.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, full badger brush that simply out performs my much more expensive bush (which has been relegated to my gym bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes, but this one looks amazing, lathers well, and hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle yet (~3 months).  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done, squeeze the extra left-over lather back into your soap cup (from the brush, you dummy), if you&#x27;re using the good stuff, that will save you some money.</li>
            <li> Whoever purchased one of those babys, please weigh in, because I can&#x27;t think how those expensive ones lather much better and apply much more smoothly than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I this brush has more than met my expectations for quality and performance, and will be my go-to brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad&#x27;s brush should be properly retired and I should get my own.</li>
            <li> pure badger.  </li>
            <li> Makes you wonder if it is really a Badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready&#x27;s, I looked here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Since my grandfather&#x27;s brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made the decision to also go with the straight razor.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole safety razor set one day on amazon.</li>
            <li> It also feels very luxurious on the face and spreads the shaving foam very well.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush was cheaply glued to the chrome handle and fell off after 2 weeks moderate use.</li>
            <li> I pre-heat the brush along with my mug and soap before I make lather, and really like the way the heated brush handle feels in my hand while I&#x27;m making the lather.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> but i think thats why i really like this brush now.  </li>
            <li> handle is much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> bristles are very</li>
            <li> You can read elsewhere about just how much water to leave on the brush before creating your lather.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel a bit rough to the touch, but they are necessary to make a good lather with the shave soap.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, nicely felt in hand.</li>
            <li> The handle had a nice heavy feel to it and the bristles were smoothe on my face.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Handle is easy to grip even when wet and stays shiny.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this after noting the brush that was included with an apothecary style mug I ordered previously would leave hairs in my soap and didn&#x27;t fit my Col. Conk safety razor/brush rack!</li>
            <li> It looks decent.  </li>
            <li> The hairs are started to come out now at a steady rate.</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;ll eventually try one of the more expensive brushes as that&#x27;s just my nature, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll be getting a lot more for my money than I&#x27;ve gotten from this brush.</li>
            <li> At one level, a brush is just a brush and any decent shaving brush will work.</li>
            <li> It holds brush well and doesn&#x27;t lose any hair when I forcibly push it into a tight brush holder.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t like this brush because the bristles were not stiff at all, in fact they are still not stiff</li>
            <li> some said its bad for my opinion its a great product!</li>
            <li> so I could start shaving my legs with the old school safety razor, and I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a much better brush and worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a complaint.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back since it took me 5 minutes to fix</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit too soft and several fell off into the box it came in before even using, and just brushing it against my hand with the same vigor you would shaving saw more loosing away.</li>
            <li> This is a nice-looking brush, but mine came apart after a year or so of hanging from a razor stand with only rare use.</li>
            <li> I think this is normal for a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to shed bristles and the chrome still looks new.</li>
            <li> The new one....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably start looking for something different pretty soon since it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s appeal.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush - it looks great and feels so in the hand, but sadly the handle is the only upgrade from the $13 Escali Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> I strongly doubt this is real badger hair, it definitely feels different than other badger and boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Basically the brush in a clear box.</li>
            <li> It will make any bathroom setup look classy.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap badger brush with a heavy chrome handle.</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> , was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a badger shaving brush since the boar brush I have had became completely unusable after just 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> But I got used to the weight incredibly fast maybe at the second shaving.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re a beginning Mekur double-edge wet shaver like me, this is very much worth the investment.</li>
            <li> With my old shaving brush I had not only my face covered but lather would be at some unexpected places of the bathroom</li>
            <li> The bristles are quite stiff and generate a fine later quickly with very little soap.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one thatwill last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; smell - although it did eventually go away.</li>
            <li> I have seen only 1 fallen bristle from the new brush and this happened on the second week of use.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush long enough to know the difference between a $20 brush and a $200 brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine what such a price difference would buy in the way of \\&quot;real world\\&quot; performance.</li>
            <li> and you need to be careful whipping up a lather in a ceramic mug/bowl not to clank the side too hard as it&#x27;s much more likely to chip</li>
            <li> Indeed, when it came the handle seemed somewhat heavy for the first time.</li>
            <li> The spread of bristles is too wide to use in a mug or, \\&quot;normal size\\&quot; bowl like an Edwin Jagger Rn6.</li>
            <li> If you want to get into wet shaving you might as well spend the extra $20 on a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and within a month the brush fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brush, it seemed a bit stiff and smelled a bit gamey.</li>
            <li> It tends to flatten out a little much while using it, but returns to the shape pictured when it dries.</li>
            <li> they are not super hard or super soft.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy handle, but I don&#x27;t see that as a particular advantage.  </li>
            <li> but the quality is apparently not that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this rate, it will not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Solid weighted handle and a stiff soft bristle just like he loves.  </li>
            <li> This is very soft on the face and lathers up every soap I&#x27;ve tried including some of the hard British and German soaps.  </li>
            <li> Little surprised on the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Not really a glamorous gift to open.</li>
            <li> But as I am a native of southern California and we don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; badgers here, I am not positive.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a stiff bristled brush.... steer clear.</li>
            <li> and I was left with the handle in one hand and glued bristles in the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, but after losing maybe two hairs at the very beginning, no more shedding.</li>
            <li> I walke by art of shaving the other day and picked up a silver tip that looked and felt the same.  </li>
            <li> I rinse and dry the brush after use, then hang it from the stand.  </li>
            <li> The hubby didn&#x27;t tell me right away, and reglued it himself, so I was unable to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Hairs are loose and falling out.</li>
            <li> The handle at its narrowest point nearest the foot is for what ever reason just slightly oblong and as a result will slide into the brush holder I purchased with it [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] in only two directions.</li>
            <li> I knew that something was odd when I opened the package and found a brush with a chrome instead of wooden handle.</li>
            <li> I like the heavy feel of the handle but wonder if it&#x27;s really necessary.</li>
            <li> I followed the Break in routine&#x27;s that I found on the web to rid the bristles of the animal smell the brush gives off when wet.</li>
            <li> After only a few shaves it smells like a Barber shop.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine growing tired of that sensation - it makes for a very pleasurable shave.    </li>
            <li> I think it is heavy enough, to kill a person if you throw it at his head.</li>
            <li> so it was not very soap efficient.</li>
            <li> not really an issue.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wet shave</li>
            <li> Chrome handle is very solid and a bit heavy but really not a problem.  </li>
            <li> Stiff enough to lift the beard, but not really scratchy.</li>
            <li> The bristles are coarser than other Badger hair brushes that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> After my mother returned from her out-of-state trip to be with her mother and bury her father, she gave me a small box containing some of his personal belongings.</li>
            <li> If you are going to wet shave badger hair is the brush to have!  </li>
            <li> The brush head itself is intact and could probably be secured back into the handle with a small dab of superglue, but I haven&#x27;t bothered.</li>
            <li> It did not smell bad when I first started using it, as others have reported, but I&#x27;ve heard that washing a brush with borax will help rid it of the initial wet animal odor.</li>
            <li> Heavy handle and minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Not certain, but its heavy, like brass or steel.</li>
            <li> I store this item as they recommend upside down in a stand.</li>
            <li> Remember to hang it brush side down...</li>
            <li> The packaging on this is less than you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell (nothing at all like the SimplyBeautiful</li>
            <li> We noticed no strong smell like others have complained, and lost only a couple hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> took away one star because it is quite slick when wet and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be on a desert island alone with this little guy than a lot of people I know.</li>
            <li> A few observations:  1.</li>
            <li> It is losing a few bristles everyday.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fairly heavy.</li>
            <li> The chrome handle is a chromed metal rather than plastic, so it is heavy, and holds heat well.</li>
            <li> Heavy in weight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time here.  </li>
            <li> but I have not had trouble maintaining my grip while using it.  </li>
            <li> By heavy</li>
            <li> Compared to a similar item from Art of Shaving, it is about 5-fold less expensive, with comparable quality.</li>
            <li> Just prior to the musky animal aroma disappearing, I was frustrated enough with the smell on me all day to look for another brush.</li>
            <li> I may try re-glueing it but not sure what adhesive to use.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for the ladies, I don&#x27;t think shaving your legs once a week gives you the same comfort.</li>
            <li> The brush performs its lathering task well and has lost no more than two bristles in over a month of use.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy with the all metal handle.</li>
            <li> This looked like it was due to a poor glue job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff.</li>
            <li> After eliminating expensive badger brushes from my search I narrowed the options to this one, Colonel Conk&#x27;s brush and Kingsley&#x27;s each costs around 22-25$. After long comparison when each of the brushes made it in and out of my cart at least one time  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to talk mamma into letting me buy a $75.00 shaving brush.</li>
            <li> i had it for over a year and use it at least twice a week sometimes up to 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I mean that if you drop it on your toe, it will break your toe.</li>
            <li> Now that the bristles are cleaned and broken in, the perceived stiffness and gamey aroma are gone.</li>
            <li> Although, I was afraid it would be too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> A sign that the chrome is very thin, thinly chromed accessories discolor from heat.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; on my face which may be a sign of lower quality badger fur, but it certainly isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.    </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t care, just shocked how poor the boxing was compared to the item itself.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I might get a lousy one.</li>
            <li> the hefty weight makes it feel unbalanced and awkward in your hand, but its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Bristles have bad odor.</li>
            <li> A buyer will not be disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> but after about 2 to 3 months of use, one day after rinsing, the bristles separated from the base altogether.</li>
            <li> When I got this the bristle \\&quot;cone\\&quot; was separated from the metal base.</li>
            <li> Wobbly at the base.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed for a $55 brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> looks great, just a little harder bristles than I expected  Slim and fits perfect in the holder I bought separately, nice looking shiny chrome</li>
            <li> The brush looks great. It will make any bathroom setup look classy. However, after using the brush twice, the hair part of the brush detached from the chrome handle. This looked like it was due to a poor glue job. I exchanged it from amazon for a second one. Same thing happened. Buyer&#x27;s beware, I believe this is a manufacturer defect since it happened twice. It is an easy job to super glue them together. So overall, I am content with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Looks great&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cheap glue that holds hair to handle. It WILL detach.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot for the price, but it definitely delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good amount of water&lt;br /&gt;I like the weight of the handle&lt;br /&gt;Gets a good lather and applies well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Brissles come over every shave&lt;br /&gt;When I used it for the first time, the knot (where the bristles attach to the handle) detached from the handle and I was left with the handle in one hand and glued bristles in the other.  I just gorilla glued it back together and it has worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, it is a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I imagined, but that&#x27;s not a complaint. Very sleek and elegant. Gives you a real sophisticated macho man feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now.  A few observations:  1. It is losing a few bristles everyday.  At this rate, it will not last very long.  2. The bristles are coarser than other Badger hair brushes that I have tried.  Makes you wonder if it is really a Badger brush.  3. It has a heavy handle, but I don&#x27;t see that as a particular advantage.  4. It looks decent.  5. I am unconvinced about its &#x27;value for money&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush. Very heavy with the all metal handle. In 2 weeks of use i have only seen one bristle come out. It does indeed smell like a wet badger, but all the nice brushes smell this way.     The packaging on this is less than you&#x27;d expect. Basically the brush in a clear box. Not really a glamorous gift to open. So re-box if you want to give someone a nice gift. I bought for my self so I didn&#x27;t care, just shocked how poor the boxing was compared to the item itself.</li>
            <li> I bought two beginner brushes for my sons. The loft and density is too floppy. It is a cheap badger brush with a heavy chrome handle.</li>
            <li> Excellent goods! It is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis (it&#x27;s an Asian thing!) but just from using it for 2 months now, maybe 2X weekly, the chrome handle has started to turn yellow. A sign that the chrome is very thin, thinly chromed accessories discolor from heat. Its not like I&#x27;m using super hot water, just what is coming out of the faucet. Oh well. I like the heavy feel of the handle but wonder if it&#x27;s really necessary. The hairs are started to come out now at a steady rate. I&#x27;ll probably start looking for something different pretty soon since it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s appeal.</li>
            <li> There are some websites with reviews on too many brushes. I didn&#x27;t find any review on this one at those websites. I was afraid that I might get a lousy one. I&#x27;m glad this is not the case. Whew! It has good brush. It holds brush well and doesn&#x27;t lose any hair when I forcibly push it into a tight brush holder. It looks nice. The reason I bought it is its chrome. It matched my bathroom&#x27;s style. As I&#x27;ve learned from reviews, badger brush is better than synthetic or boar brush. By the way, it is my first brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever badger brush.  It produces a nice lather and was a reasonable price.  I have nothing to compare it to, but I am more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> For $25 this is a wonderful shaving brush for those of us who prefer to really coat our beards in pure soap ,rather than chemicals and menthol, before we shave. This brush looks classy, has great heft in your hand and does a wonderul job.</li>
            <li> My maternal grandfather passed away some 40 years ago. After my mother returned from her out-of-state trip to be with her mother and bury her father, she gave me a small box containing some of his personal belongings. Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush. I had no use for it at the time. As I unpacked after a recent move I rediscovered this item and decided to use it. It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad&#x27;s brush should be properly retired and I should get my own. Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready&#x27;s, I looked here at Amazon. This was the brush I decided upon. It&#x27;s ok.    It is definitely NOT my grandfather&#x27;s brush - quality-wise. Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer. So he would not have paid a lot for his. So I thought this one might be similar in quality. I was wrong. It&#x27;s very stiff. It does not do a great job with the soap lather. It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles. This is probably what badgers smell like. But as I am a native of southern California and we don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; badgers here, I am not positive. This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use. Just prior to the musky animal aroma disappearing, I was frustrated enough with the smell on me all day to look for another brush. Since my grandfather&#x27;s brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free. But was it a matter of quality or simply a matter of time?    I purchased a $70 Vulfix brush, hand-made on the Isle of Man in the UK.     [...]    It is much more like granddad&#x27;s in color, feel, and use. It lathers very nicely. It&#x27;s very soft on the face. It holds a lot of water. There was a slight smell (nothing at all like the SimplyBeautiful smell)that was gone after the 2nd use. If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one thatwill last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the \\&quot;badgery\\&quot; smell - although it did eventually go away. I haven&#x27;t made the decision to also go with the straight razor. I figure I will give the EMTs in the area a break and stick with the safety razor.....</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it looks like. I beautiful and functional badger hair brush. It works great, feels great, and looks great. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Great Brush without breaking the bank. It&#x27;s hard to talk mamma into letting me buy a $75.00 shaving brush. This brush seems to work better than expected and the price was more than fare on Amazon.I followed the Break in routine&#x27;s that I found on the web to rid the bristles of the animal smell the brush gives off when wet. After only a few shaves it smells like a Barber shop.Great brush looks good, feels good with a great price.</li>
            <li> Brush worked good for a couple of months, then the brishels began to fall out. Bought in Jan 2015 &amp; now can not use.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole safety razor set one day on amazon. I bought them all separately. I like the product, but it is slightly larger than the stand I purchased to go with it. It fits... if I hang it from where the badger hair attaches to it, and not the handle.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month now. Bristles are softer than I had read they might be.  Chrome handle is very solid and a bit heavy but really not a problem.  I thought the smooth chrome might be slippery to handle while brushing on the soap but hasn&#x27;t been.  The handle at its narrowest point nearest the foot is for what ever reason just slightly oblong and as a result will slide into the brush holder I purchased with it [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] in only two directions. But that&#x27;s no big deal.  The comfort of the brush bristles are what really matter and they are quite good on this brush.</li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat this brush. Super soft bristles, full plume, and makes a really nice lather. Well-done!</li>
            <li> VERY nice brush.  Looks good, has a lot of heft and weight, holds water well and, therefore, lathers up a storm.  I will definitely buy again when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin. I would recommend this product to everyone. Sturdy and well made. The weight is very nice as well,</li>
            <li> I got this to put on my chrome razor stand with my chrome razor and trust me, it looks great.  It also feels very luxurious on the face and spreads the shaving foam very well.</li>
            <li> Fits on stand called \\&quot;Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors\\&quot;, wasn&#x27;t sure from all the descriptions.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to have a higher quality I personally feel better off with my cheap boar head brush.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first but after about 2 to 3 months of use, one day after rinsing, the bristles separated from the base altogether. Put it in my draw and started using the cheapo pigs hair brush I got from a kit. That one isn&#x27;t as nice nor does it lather up as well, but it sure lasted a lot longer and probably cost $2. VERY disappointed for a $55 brush. I may try re-glueing it but not sure what adhesive to use. And why should I need to do this.</li>
            <li> The bush came as described. It tends to flatten out a little much while using it, but returns to the shape pictured when it dries.</li>
            <li> When I got this the bristle \\&quot;cone\\&quot; was separated from the metal base. I had to glue it back together. If they had flared the \\&quot;cup\\&quot; for the bristles out a bit at the bottom it would have stayed in there. Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back since it took me 5 minutes to fix but the quality is apparently not that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent comfort. I like the handle.</li>
            <li> Little surprised on the quality of this brush. The chrome has some imperfections, but that I will not fault.   This brush is fairly heavy. The bristles are surprising soft. I&#x27;m going to go out on limb here and say this   is the best $15 badger brush available. Get one!</li>
            <li> I like it because it is smaller than the one I use at home so it&#x27;s great for travel</li>
            <li> The head of the brush was cheaply glued to the chrome handle and fell off after 2 weeks moderate use.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse purchase. I thought it looked good, and I&#x27;d get a little use out of it. But it was bought mostly on looks alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. This is a beautiful, full badger brush that simply out performs my much more expensive bush (which has been relegated to my gym bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rare when an impulse purchase exceeds expectations. So if you&#x27;re a beginning Mekur double-edge wet shaver like me, this is very much worth the investment. I don&#x27;t know how much better brushes that cost over $100 are. Whoever purchased one of those babys, please weigh in, because I can&#x27;t think how those expensive ones lather much better and apply much more smoothly than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...does the $100 models give you winning stock tips? That&#x27;s the only way I can justify a return on investment at this point of my early adventures in old-school wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I&#x27;m purchasing another of these brush...you know...as a hedge.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush - it looks great and feels so in the hand, but sadly the handle is the only upgrade from the $13 Escali Shaving Brush. The bristles are a bit too soft and several fell off into the box it came in before even using, and just brushing it against my hand with the same vigor you would shaving saw more loosing away. Ultimately, I would recommend the Escali if you are just wanting to try out this type of shaving and its accouterment. If/when you become convinced it is a part of your routine you would like to permanently alter, spend the money on a $50+ Parker Shave Brush (or another well respected brand)â€“they are beautiful, last forever, lose a couple bristles the first time, but hardly more over extended use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and it&#x27;s still in great shape. It doesn&#x27;t seem to shed bristles and the chrome still looks new. It has a good feel to it, just the right amount of heft. I&#x27;ve not used the more costly badger brushes, so I&#x27;m not sure what they would give you that this one lacks, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this one. It did not smell bad when I first started using it, as others have reported, but I&#x27;ve heard that washing a brush with borax will help rid it of the initial wet animal odor.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful.  Shipping was standard.  My husband likes the feel of the bristles, and they hold plenty of soap.  We noticed no strong smell like others have complained, and lost only a couple hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second use the bristles separated from the handle.  The hubby didn&#x27;t tell me right away, and reglued it himself, so I was unable to send it back.  For the price it&#x27;s a good starter brush as long as you keep your glue handy.</li>
            <li> The handle on this brush is outstanding.  Good weight, comfortable to hold and good looking.  The badger on this could be a bit softer, but a good value none the less.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Brush is good and has not lost any hairs.  Handle is easy to grip even when wet and stays shiny.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> As I wrote elsewhere regarding the Tweezerman brush, I think that I received the Simply Beautiful brush either as a substitute or by mistake. Given that I was charged the lower price of the Tweezerman, I have no complaints.    I knew that something was odd when I opened the package and found a brush with a chrome instead of wooden handle. Honestly, I gave it no thought at the time and started using the brush the same day it arrived.    Now I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush long enough to know the difference between a $20 brush and a $200 brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine what such a price difference would buy in the way of \\&quot;real world\\&quot; performance. The materials are likely somewhat better in the more expensive brush and, I would hope, the assembly would be superb compared to the cheaper one. Yet, I somehow couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend even $50 on a brush unless I would have gotten some guaranty of superior performance.    With that said, this brush absorbs plenty of water and, after a good shake, really whips up a nice lather. It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; on my face which may be a sign of lower quality badger fur, but it certainly isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.    If  you&#x27;re just starting to wet-shave, you could spend a lot more money and probably not get a brush that&#x27;s appreciably better than this one. Oh, I&#x27;ll eventually try one of the more expensive brushes as that&#x27;s just my nature, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll be getting a lot more for my money than I&#x27;ve gotten from this brush.</li>
            <li> If you are going to wet shave badger hair is the brush to have!  It holds more water and exfoliates the shin whil you apply the cream.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush, well made, and a solid value for the money (I got it when it was at 19.95). It looks quite nice, and performs as well as it looks. The chrome handle is a chromed metal rather than plastic, so it is heavy, and holds heat well. I pre-heat the brush along with my mug and soap before I make lather, and really like the way the heated brush handle feels in my hand while I&#x27;m making the lather. I think the extra heat radiated from the handle helps keep the lather warm.    When I first got the brush, it seemed a bit stiff and smelled a bit gamey. Now that the bristles are cleaned and broken in, the perceived stiffness and gamey aroma are gone. The bristles impart a really pleasant sensation while building lather on my face, with just enough \\&quot;prickle\\&quot; that you know its got to be doing a good job cleaning the facial oils off and helping the whiskers get fully moisturized and ready for shaving. I can&#x27;t imagine growing tired of that sensation - it makes for a very pleasurable shave.    At one level, a brush is just a brush and any decent shaving brush will work. However, I this brush has more than met my expectations for quality and performance, and will be my go-to brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> Heavy handle and minimal shedding. Looks great on the stand next to my Merkur 34C. Excellent value for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> I had one years ago and it lasted and lasted.  I bought several replacement ones that would last only a year or so before falling apart.  Cheap oneslost bristles daily--thus one has yet to lose any.</li>
            <li> The brush dropped out of the handle after one use (by hubby). Bummer. The seller refunded payment quickly, but couldn&#x27;t offer a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Fell apart in 2 weeks and had to glue it back together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mug and brush for many years.  Without a doubt, this is the best brush I&#x27;ve evr owned.  Its priced really great, delivers a great lather, and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after noting the brush that was included with an apothecary style mug I ordered previously would leave hairs in my soap and didn&#x27;t fit my Col. Conk safety razor/brush rack! THIS brush is a solid performer and fits beautifully in my rack. Hasn&#x27;t lost one hair. Weight is great, not too light, and the handle feels really great in my hand. I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Great shaving Badger brush!</li>
            <li> WOW!!! What an OUTSTANDING brush!!!!  You feel the heft, which makes it great, after a few uses, it starts filling out and spreads foam great.  Would highly recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a badger shaving brush since the boar brush I have had became completely unusable after just 2 years of use. It was losing hairs almost every day. Need to note that was a cheap one which came in a set with a soap and a bowl for $12 altogether. After eliminating expensive badger brushes from my search I narrowed the options to this one, Colonel Conk&#x27;s brush and Kingsley&#x27;s each costs around 22-25$. After long comparison when each of the brushes made it in and out of my cart at least one time  I picked the SimplyBeautiful one mostly because of the chrome handle. Although, I was afraid it would be too heavy for me. Indeed, when it came the handle seemed somewhat heavy for the first time. I think it is heavy enough, to kill a person if you throw it at his head. But I got used to the weight incredibly fast maybe at the second shaving. It gives good lather which covers the places on face which need to be covered. With my old shaving brush I had not only my face covered but lather would be at some unexpected places of the bathroom so it was not very soap efficient. I have seen only 1 fallen bristle from the new brush and this happened on the second week of use. I think this is normal for a new shaving brush. Now it is 3 weeks went by since I started using it and I have no complains at all. Moreover, my bathroom looks more sophisticated with it. I store this item as they recommend upside down in a stand. I like starting mornings with shaving now and recommend it to all.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is December 2012 and a year went on. Still cannot complain. I have seen 2-3 fallen bristles for the entire period and consider this as acceptable.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the doubt that some said its good and some said its bad for my opinion its a great product!</li>
            <li> This was my first brush. I bought it over two years ago. It has been dependable, produces a great lather, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and has a nice size. I love the weight of the chrome handle. I recently upgraded to the Silvertip version and I love it too. I never see anything written about the Simply Beautiful brand, but this is top drawer with me.</li>
            <li> Brush looks nothing like the photo.</li>
            <li> good brush and holds up well</li>
            <li> I strongly doubt this is real badger hair, it definitely feels different than other badger and boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve owned.  The brush has the stiffness of a woman&#x27;s make-up brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Appearance: this brush looks nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles are way too floppy to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles fall out, starting at day one.&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy in weight.&lt;br /&gt;- The spread of bristles is too wide to use in a mug or, \\&quot;normal size\\&quot; bowl like an Edwin Jagger Rn6.</li>
            <li> This brush is very dense, the handle is solid and looks great. The best part...the price, at this price range you will not find such a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> I got this so I could start shaving my legs with the old school safety razor, and I really like this brush.  It does a fantastic job working up a great lather, and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  The bristles feel a bit rough to the touch, but they are necessary to make a good lather with the shave soap.</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t like this brush because the bristles were not stiff at all, in fact they are still not stiff but i think thats why i really like this brush now.  When you push the brush against your face, it mushrooms out to put a nice swath of later all over.  If you are looking for a stiff bristled brush.... steer clear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush that looks great and performs well. I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of lathering shaving soap, but the brush is sturdy and performs well.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the best brush you can buy, for a beginner or someone that wants a decent backup/travel brush, it&#x27;s great.  No problems with odor or ability to build a good lather.  Overall a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought one a year ago and it was a terrific purchase. So I purchased 3 as gifts. They were cheaply made. Compared to the original brush I purchased in 2012. The new one....&lt;br /&gt;The handle is much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;The Bristles are more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles come out of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;All in all</li>
            <li> this brush is nice and it does the job. i had it for over a year and use it at least twice a week sometimes up to 4 times a week. the hairs are nice and with a medium strength to them. they are not super hard or super soft. they do provide a nice feel to the face and lathering shaving cream is easy and smooth and does not leave clumps or missed spots like other cheaper brushes sometimes do. only now after a year or so do some hairs com off the brush and i have to pick them out of my face but for the most part this happens once a while. not really an issue.</li>
            <li> RelaÃ§Ã£o custo benefÃ­cio muito boa. A encomenda chegou no prazo. Eu compraria novamente e recomendo o produto. Viva o Brasil!!!</li>
            <li> Works well and looks good.  Keep it away from the pets because they are attracted to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time here.  If you want to get into wet shaving you might as well spend the extra $20 on a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and within a month the brush fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price, and the price was cheap. Might just get another  for traveling.It great for a novice as well as a seasoned wet shaver.</li>
            <li> This brush is horrible. I used it for a month and it continuously she&#x27;d more than my German Shepherd in the summer during every use.</li>
            <li> Are you sometimes grumpy or blue when you get out of bed? Well, now that I have a good brush and a good soap, every morning holds the promise of a nice shave. I feel sorry for the ladies, I don&#x27;t think shaving your legs once a week gives you the same comfort. Forget penis envy :).....Will the brush last for years? Only time will tell, but given that even mass produced ones can last for years, I&#x27;m guessing this one could be something you can put in your will. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, but after losing maybe two hairs at the very beginning, no more shedding. Drop it into your basin of hot water and let the handle warm up in seconds. Then hit the soap and inside of 15 seconds you have yourself a beautiful foam. When you&#x27;re done, squeeze the extra left-over lather back into your soap cup (from the brush, you dummy), if you&#x27;re using the good stuff, that will save you some money. You can read elsewhere about just how much water to leave on the brush before creating your lather. Combine this with a good shaving soap (yes Virginia, $20 for one cake, but that cake will last ya. I&#x27;m using Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap and I love it; I&#x27;m guessing this cake will last me 8 months to a year and I shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re done shaving, two or three swings and most of the water zips right off of the brush and it&#x27;s back to its bushy self. I&#x27;d rather be on a desert island alone with this little guy than a lot of people I know. Remember to hang it brush side down... of course.</li>
            <li> Good thing for not expensive cost!  It is heavy, nicely felt in hand. Compared to a similar item from Art of Shaving, it is about 5-fold less expensive, with comparable quality. Recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Looked great, but within a couple months the brushes all fell out.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this and an escali.  This is a much better brush and worth the few extra dollars. This is very soft on the face and lathers up every soap I&#x27;ve tried including some of the hard British and German soaps.  I walke by art of shaving the other day and picked up a silver tip that looked and felt the same.  Price was $180.  I think this is a good deal.  Someday I may splurge on a Simpson, but this is good for now.</li>
            <li> When I purchased a chrome finished Harry&#x27;s razor from the manufacturer&#x27;s site, I decided to maximize enjoyment of my shaving ritual rather than avoiding what had become a chore.  I bought this brush as part of my &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.  I enjoy looking at it hanging from the chrome razor and brush stand (also from SimplyBeautiful) between shaves.  The brush performs its lathering task well and has lost no more than two bristles in over a month of use.  The handle is smooth but I have not had trouble maintaining my grip while using it.  I rinse and dry the brush after use, then hang it from the stand.  I have not noticed any imperfections in the finish nor any corrosion from keeping it in a damp environment.</li>
            <li> When I first received this item it worked perfectly. The handle had a nice heavy feel to it and the bristles were smoothe on my face. But after using it a couple times the wax/glue that holds all the hair, detached from the handle.  You can squeeze back the wax into the handle and still use it but its just matter of time until hair start falling out.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for the price.  Great quality, great feel.  A buyer will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I would give it 6 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> My husband raved about it.  Solid weighted handle and a stiff soft bristle just like he loves.  A great item</li>
            <li> pure badger.  not so lathersome at first, but after the first week of use, does fine.  and the price was right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good looking brush. It lathers ok so far. I think I need some time to break it in. 5/5 because it&#x27;s as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product. Great looking and well manufactured. I would buy this item again.  Some of the hairs do fall off</li>
            <li> Good heavy brush. Have not had any problems with bristle loss. Stiff enough to lift the beard, but not really scratchy. I have owned this for several months, and love it !</li>
            <li> This is a nice-looking brush, but mine came apart after a year or so of hanging from a razor stand with only rare use. I suspect this might have been caused by excess humidity in the bathroom loosening the adhesive, but this is a bathroom accessory after all. The brush head itself is intact and could probably be secured back into the handle with a small dab of superglue, but I haven&#x27;t bothered.</li>
            <li> Hairs are loose and falling out. Wobbly at the base. Bristles have bad odor. Should I return it for credit?</li>
            <li> The build quality could be better, but the look and feel is nice, especially for the price (under $25 on the promo I used).</li>
            <li> I already had a wood badger brush but wanted chrome to go with my chrome razor/stand (will still use the wood brush for traveling). It looks good and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing hair (like my wood brush does). It&#x27;s got a bit more heft to it and you need to be careful whipping up a lather in a ceramic mug/bowl not to clank the side too hard as it&#x27;s much more likely to chip/crack it than the wood brush. I face lather now, just putting the brush in the mug when not using it, so that solves that!</li>
            <li> Good product using it daily.</li>
            <li> Right out of the gate you know you have a great brush. The bristles are quite stiff and generate a fine later quickly with very little soap. The bristles hold up under the hottest water never and \\&quot;go limp\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is flawless chrome plated metal. Not certain, but its heavy, like brass or steel. By heavy I mean that if you drop it on your toe, it will break your toe. I&#x27;m kind of afraid that it will break my shaving mug if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star because it is quite slick when wet and the hefty weight makes it feel unbalanced and awkward in your hand, but its not a deal breaker. I use it every time I wet shave and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a do-over I would look to the same brand, but with a traditional wooden or composite handle. I would only recommend the chrome to someone who demanded it for aesthetic purposes, it is quite beautiful and well made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes, but this one looks amazing, lathers well, and hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle yet (~3 months).  I didn&#x27;t notice any smell when I first got this brush either.  I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes for a lot more money, but for someone just getting into using a brush, this is wonderful.</li>
