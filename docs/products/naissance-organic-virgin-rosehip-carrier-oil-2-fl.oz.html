            <li>happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. excellent Customer services</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with all the products I have received from Amazon,no problems, ever!</li>
            <li>Works great under my make-up.  </li>
            <li>but it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>30 not 50.The product is great like I said,but the customer service is not so great.</li>
            <li>I mix a couple of drops with my moisturizer and it makes my skin feel very nice.</li>
            <li>This product might be good -</li>
            <li>also love the Naissance people who extract it and offer it to others to achieve beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my scalp and someone told me rose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>I love the oil as it is like a serum.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping for the results of better looking skin and evening of skin tone.  </li>
            <li>looks more like 25ml maybe 30ml.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this one it is much better than the one I bought from another vendor it has no fishy order, a bit oily though I didn&#x27;t mind after seeing how well my skin soaked up the essence of this oil.</li>
            <li>my skin never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked out great , my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to receive a FULL bottle for the price, the bottle arrived with about 2-21/2 inches of room for more product to fill inside.</li>
            <li>Also, my makeup glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>But I love anything rose related.</li>
            <li>All stars for Rose Hip Oil because its natural and not oily.</li>
            <li>in to about 5-7 days were we live and the price is just right!!!</li>
            <li>This oil is good for dry skin but does not plump skin and diminish wrinkles like Dr. Oz suggested on national television.</li>
            <li>it looks/smells fresh, but the bottle did not come with a seal inside the cap and mine leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the bottle was over half empty,I sent an email to their customer service telling them</li>
            <li>This one is high quality, no bad smell.</li>
            <li>Love that it is only 1 ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I am sooo glad it has finally arrived!</li>
            <li>Pure product</li>
            <li>So its highly recommended to all but test first</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil should be an orange-red and have a distinct odor, this is colorless and just about odorless, and as far as I can tell might be cooking oil - which I wouldn&#x27;t use on a bet or a dare.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates your skin, have not seen any reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>hip oil would help, it really does.  </li>
            <li>(The shipping was kind of slow</li>
            <li>what it really is. :o</li>
            <li>This is going to help my facial rash so much!</li>
            <li>you may be allergic or sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I believe that a Young skin is well hydrated.  </li>
            <li>After a few days my skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>I cant say much about the actual oil itself since i have not used it long enough to determine its effectiveness, which would depend on what its being used for.</li>
            <li>It has a characteristic odour and an orangey colour - this oil is clear and odourless...</li>
            <li>You need only a few drops for your face to keep your skin moisturized the whole day!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have purchased other rosehip seed oil products online and they have smelled rancid like fish oil.  This one is high quality, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil should be an orange-red and have a distinct odor, this is colorless and just about odorless, and as far as I can tell might be cooking oil - which I wouldn&#x27;t use on a bet or a dare. How disappointing. I tossed it since I have no idea what it really is. :o(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for more than 5 years. It has a characteristic odour and an orangey colour - this oil is clear and odourless...it&#x27;s not Rosehip oil. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> It worked out great , my skin is soft.You should try it.It came to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me in to about 5-7 days were we live and the price is just right!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is good for dry skin but does not plump skin and diminish wrinkles like Dr. Oz suggested on national television.</li>
            <li> bought for sister would buy again</li>
            <li> All stars for Rose Hip Oil because its natural and not oily. So its highly recommended to all but test first you may be allergic or sensitive.</li>
            <li> Soft Skin and less noticeable wrinkles.  Love that it is only 1 ingredient.  Works great under my make-up.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Hooray! I am sooo glad it has finally arrived! This is going to help my facial rash so much! Going to make some face cream!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love the oil as it is like a serum. You need only a few drops for your face to keep your skin moisturized the whole day! I have dry skin, but after using the oil I don&#x27;t even need a cream.</li>
            <li> I like the lightness of this oil and I am hoping for the results of better looking skin and evening of skin tone.  This oil goes a long way and it does not leave you feeling like an oil slick.  I have not used it long enough to tout the benefits long term but it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product might be good - it looks/smells fresh, but the bottle did not come with a seal inside the cap and mine leaked during shipping. I had only a scant half bottle and a box of sodden packing peanuts.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the bottle was over half empty,I sent an email to their customer service telling them and I got an email back saying they use 60ml bottles and you get 50ml with your purchase,and I was assured the bottle contained 50ml.I understand that but when you have a 60ml bottle that&#x27;s over half empty it does not add up to 50ml looks more like 25ml maybe 30ml.Half of 60 is 30 not 50.The product is great like I said,but the customer service is not so great.I will not purchase from this company again unless I get the other 20ml of product I paid for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this one it is much better than the one I bought from another vendor it has no fishy order, a bit oily though I didn&#x27;t mind after seeing how well my skin soaked up the essence of this oil. my skin never looked better. A keeper indeed too bad it takes so long to ship.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with all the products I have received from Amazon,no problems, ever!</li>
            <li> Bought this oil following research on the internet about it&#x27;s anti-aging properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the morning before my day cream, on my face and neck.  Didn&#x27;t see my skin getting 10 years younger but it absorb almost immediately and I believe that a Young skin is well hydrated.  Will continue to use it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. excellent Customer services</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to receive a FULL bottle for the price, the bottle arrived with about 2-21/2 inches of room for more product to fill inside. (i guess the seller is extremely approximate with the measuring) Its definitely not a large quantity and wouldn&#x27;t last long with daily use. I cant say much about the actual oil itself since i have not used it long enough to determine its effectiveness, which would depend on what its being used for. I myself am using it for a scar and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days. (The shipping was kind of slow but it did arrive before the expected delivery date.)</li>
            <li> Really hydrates your skin, have not seen any reduction in wrinkles. Would prefer glass bottle. Will continue to use. Pure product</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp and someone told me rose hip oil would help, it really does.  I just wish it were a cure.  But I love anything rose related.</li>
            <li> I mix a couple of drops with my moisturizer and it makes my skin feel very nice. Also, my makeup glides on smoothly. I would definately order this again. It does take a few weeks to receive it so take that in consideration when you are ordering.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  it softens and moisterizes my skin. I use it as a serum. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Naissance people who extract it and offer it to others to achieve beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> After a few days my skin definitely looks better. Pores seem smaller and my skin is just way smoother. And no smell.</li>
