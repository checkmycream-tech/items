            <li>Awesome bottles.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful, but when you try to put it on both from the pencil and the liquid, you can&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li>The pencil is beautifully pigmented, and although the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t seem to be waterproof, it took a bit of scrubbing to get it off from where i tested it on my wrist.</li>
            <li>.I am so happy we did.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Creates a great look.</li>

            <li>Great colors.</li>
            <li>Great quality and I am into my self manicures for decades.</li>
            <li>I should have known better!!</li>
            <li>so I can purchase her some more make-up!!</li>
            <li>Took a couple of layers to show up as brightly as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The eye makeup is good quality too.</li>
            <li>Best of both worlds, are really cute design bottles :)</li>
            <li>(Oh and the earrings are adorable, the sparkles are so cute I can&#x27;t get over it. :D )</li>
            <li>But now have discovered what a great product it is - the metallic eyeliners are fabulous, and am enjoying!!</li>
            <li>very beautiful and easy to put on colors are very beautiful shows very well.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I am in love with these!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The colors are Nice.</li>
            <li>Nice application, both pencil and liquid,</li>
            <li>but it still is a nice shade no doubt.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use the gold because it&#x27;s so think and won&#x27;t apply in a nice line.</li>
            <li>Liquid pigmentation is ok but pencil doesn&#x27;t have good pigmentation....</li>
            <li>Stayed on for hours, no smudging, SUPER bright colors.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous bold colors, I got what I asked for.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and vibrant, would be an excellent bargain but the blue eyeliner brush was damaged when I received it yesterday.</li>
            <li>I love these Kleancolor Eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>My sister bought these for me as a gift for my birthday and they couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>I love how you can use the liquid,  but that each of them come with a mini eye pencil too in case you want to apply it with a pencil.</li>
            <li>Halloween - not going to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the one I was most looking forward to...</li>
            <li>No at all pleased with this purchase...</li>
            <li>These are all duo&#x27;s with a liquid liner and a smal pencil in the top cap.</li>
            <li>Cute, just not my taste.  </li>
            <li>Just MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending more for better quality.  </li>
            <li>I have a set and gifted a set to a friend.</li>
            <li>pleased and will definately order another set.</li>
            <li>Love the duo quality of it.</li>
            <li>they fit nicely in hand.</li>
            <li>I am going to really enjoy using these for the rest of the summer!</li>
            <li>and I love the Pencil at the tips</li>
            <li>Love all of the colors</li>
            <li>Maybe I just ended up with a crappy pack but for that I will not order more.</li>
            <li>The pencil part is located in the top and tends to fall out when using the liquid applicator.</li>
            <li>I love the ALL DAY WEAR and</li>
            <li>Quick delivery very satisfied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, the colors are pretty and somewhat bright.</li>
            <li>There really good and the colors are so bight and exact I love them</li>
            <li>Some of the colors show up nice, and are buildable, but the formula is super goopy.</li>
            <li>and that was a very pretty shade and shows up nicely.</li>
            <li>Fine line, dries quickly, love the colors.</li>
            <li>overall a very good product</li>
            <li>I was most excited for the purple.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>The blue was nice and bright but not garish.</li>
            <li>Product peals off easily,</li>
            <li>Really easy to take along.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Application is pleasant, and I have had no  problems with this product so far!</li>
            <li>These are all amazing and are very durable even after water contact!</li>
            <li>I would love to get a full refund</li>
            <li>It is a cheap waxy 1/4 size pencil that is not metallic or glittery by any means.  </li>
            <li>Very happy despite the liquid brown being dried up.</li>
            <li>Plus the rest don&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need a cheap pair to turn my ears colors anyway.</li>
            <li>I mainly was looking for a nice copper liner.</li>
            <li>They go on very easy and show up very well on my olive skin.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this one and thought it looked fun!    </li>
            <li>pleased with them and would certainly purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited when these arrived...</li>
            <li>Okay I do really like them.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and they show up really well on my darker skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for this deal of liquid liner plus pencil.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and she loves the bold colors.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new found eyeliner manufacturer and supplier.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, amazing product!</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty in their metallic ways!</li>
            <li>So much fun.</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely stunning and even better than expected considering the price.  </li>
            <li>fun colors</li>
            <li>Colors are fun.  </li>
            <li>But I do like the pencils and the bottles fun shapes.</li>
            <li>I think some colors were nice, where others fell flat.    </li>
            <li>I could see how this stuff could easily bother anyone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line(pun intended), don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li>Product is very cheap and waxy, it comes in cute plastic containers, not worth purchasing!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE makeup, and probably have enough for 3 lifetimes, so</li>
            <li>One of the brush ends broke while trying to dip it back in for more liquid</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be okay for someone who wanted to use it as regular eye pencil</li>
            <li>An eyeliner stick fell out of top and one of the brushes broke off in the bottle on the third use.</li>
            <li>Great color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I got a teal color instead of a purple, which was the reason why I bought this in the first place.</li>
            <li>Love the blue.</li>
            <li>The color are pretty though.</li>
            <li>I was not opening the bottom portion, only top.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids at first stuck together.  </li>
            <li>I know the price is good, but, I don&#x27;t see myself using any of these for all day use, so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>the product is really nice, but the silver and golden is not used much, so went to waste</li>
            <li>Nice colors but pigments are not very strong</li>
            <li>True to the color you see online also long wearing and very pretty.</li>
            <li>But that lasted a whole 5mins.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But I really like this product</li>
            <li>The pencil alone doesn&#x27;t have quite enough pigment to show nicely but paired with it&#x27;s liquid part, it does show up enough.  </li>
            <li>They are so dramatic, last all day, and look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Other than that, i love these colors.</li>
            <li>The only color I&#x27;ve tried so far is black and it shows up pretty good.</li>
            <li>Showed a few days early with a cute pair of earnings!</li>
            <li>You can break these up as stocking  stuffers, Easter baskets or just give then to that person who likes to try new things with their makeup!</li>
            <li>These are even better than I expected&#x27; The colors are pretty and vibrant without looking cheap or childish.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care for the brush for the liquid liner because it&#x27;s a bit harder to get a clean and precise line.  </li>
            <li>Changing previous review, and glad to have chance.  </li>
            <li>The only things I dislike about this product is you tend to lose the liner plugged into the top of the liquid liner case, and on occasion I&#x27;ve had issues with the actual liquid liner case falling apart.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like that it clumps my lashes together or pulls some out when trying to get it off.</li>
            <li>the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a leak or eyeliner on anything they came fine in the package but for some reason they seem empty.</li>
            <li>so amazing ill buy more later</li>
            <li>Silver and Gold - Both the liquid and the pencil of these two showed much more than I expected  Blue</li>
            <li>Colors are vivid and metallic looking.</li>
            <li>Vivid colors.</li>
            <li>Really The pigment is not good in either the top or bottom applicators.</li>
            <li>Did not receive free \\&quot;random color\\&quot; earrings... which is fine by me.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun, and a decent price, but not worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Complete coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I really like creating different looks with these.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Just wow.</li>
            <li>I did like the blue and silver liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t remove like normal liner.</li>
            <li>When I got mine two of them were pretty much empty?</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Mixed bag - really liked all of the liquid colors - but one was stuck and had to use a pliers to open, another the brush portion was stuck and broken.</li>
            <li>Black - This was kind of dull.</li>
            <li>Then again the other ones don&#x27;t feel like there is a whole lot in them.</li>
            <li>The brush for the liquid liner could be a little more firm.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have ran in to so far is that the pencil at the top is lose but they are twisted pencils any way</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it needed multiple coats before it was visible, but it was a really nice shade of jewel blue.  </li>
            <li>These colors are dull, and the product cakes quickly and does not go on well.  </li>
            <li>The product is a little gummy and the bottles are only about half full of not less.</li>

            <li> I LOVE makeup, and probably have enough for 3 lifetimes, so</li>
            <li> One of the brush ends broke while trying to dip it back in for more liquid</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be okay for someone who wanted to use it as regular eye pencil</li>
            <li> An eyeliner stick fell out of top and one of the brushes broke off in the bottle on the third use.</li>
            <li> Great color and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I got a teal color instead of a purple, which was the reason why I bought this in the first place.</li>
            <li> Love the blue.</li>
            <li> The color are pretty though.</li>
            <li> I was not opening the bottom portion, only top.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids at first stuck together.  </li>
            <li> I know the price is good, but, I don&#x27;t see myself using any of these for all day use, so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> the product is really nice, but the silver and golden is not used much, so went to waste</li>
            <li> Nice colors but pigments are not very strong</li>
            <li> True to the color you see online also long wearing and very pretty.</li>
            <li> But that lasted a whole 5mins.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But I really like this product</li>
            <li> The pencil alone doesn&#x27;t have quite enough pigment to show nicely but paired with it&#x27;s liquid part, it does show up enough.  </li>
            <li> They are so dramatic, last all day, and look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Other than that, i love these colors.</li>
            <li> The only color I&#x27;ve tried so far is black and it shows up pretty good.</li>
            <li> Showed a few days early with a cute pair of earnings!</li>
            <li> You can break these up as stocking  stuffers, Easter baskets or just give then to that person who likes to try new things with their makeup!</li>
            <li> These are even better than I expected&#x27; The colors are pretty and vibrant without looking cheap or childish.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for the brush for the liquid liner because it&#x27;s a bit harder to get a clean and precise line.  </li>
            <li> Changing previous review, and glad to have chance.  </li>
            <li> The only things I dislike about this product is you tend to lose the liner plugged into the top of the liquid liner case, and on occasion I&#x27;ve had issues with the actual liquid liner case falling apart.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like that it clumps my lashes together or pulls some out when trying to get it off.</li>
            <li> the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a leak or eyeliner on anything they came fine in the package but for some reason they seem empty.</li>
            <li> so amazing ill buy more later</li>
            <li> Silver and Gold - Both the liquid and the pencil of these two showed much more than I expected  Blue</li>
            <li> Colors are vivid and metallic looking.</li>
            <li> Vivid colors.</li>
            <li> Really The pigment is not good in either the top or bottom applicators.</li>
            <li> Did not receive free \\&quot;random color\\&quot; earrings... which is fine by me.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun, and a decent price, but not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Complete coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I really like creating different looks with these.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Just wow.</li>
            <li> I did like the blue and silver liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t remove like normal liner.</li>
            <li> When I got mine two of them were pretty much empty?</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Mixed bag - really liked all of the liquid colors - but one was stuck and had to use a pliers to open, another the brush portion was stuck and broken.</li>
            <li> Black - This was kind of dull.</li>
            <li> Then again the other ones don&#x27;t feel like there is a whole lot in them.</li>
            <li> The brush for the liquid liner could be a little more firm.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have ran in to so far is that the pencil at the top is lose but they are twisted pencils any way</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it needed multiple coats before it was visible, but it was a really nice shade of jewel blue.  </li>
            <li> These colors are dull, and the product cakes quickly and does not go on well.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little gummy and the bottles are only about half full of not less.</li>
            <li> pencil portions were not at all special - no better or different from other pencil</li>
            <li> Other than that, the colors are nice and none of them came broken or empty.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so chic and different from all the other eyeliners</li>
            <li> On of them way dry when it arrived.</li>
            <li> As the day progressed and after I washedoff the makeup, my eye lids and under eyes began to dry out and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> it takes several layers to show up even the dark colors</li>
            <li> The Bottles were dry and empty!</li>
            <li> The whole piece arrived broken off inside.</li>
            <li> Color as expected.</li>
            <li> Several of them were already broken when they came, and the colors were far lighter than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the little pencils are not very secure and they keep falling out.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The other end is a pencil type liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were a little skeptical about the price but the colors were so pretty we bought them anyway.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be cheap and in bad condition upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be that rough to remove makeup so close to my eyes!!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that when I received them, they were falling apart a little.</li>
            <li> Never got those - although I could care less</li>
            <li> warning is that it takes some eyelashes with it when you take it off, so I end up wearing it less than I would otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottles where chipped and the regular eyeliner fell out of base when I opened it for the first time, making it unusable .</li>
            <li> They do dry rather thick though</li>
            <li> and I was so embarrassed to have given her such a shoddy product!</li>
            <li> The bottles are awkward,the bottom bulb a liquid, the sharp end a small pencil.</li>
            <li> The Black one arrived broken had to try to glue the wand back on (still working on it)...</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a jet black, and I felt like this was not that dark.</li>
            <li> And the ones that did work when applied to the eye they dried and then looked cracked on the eyes lids...</li>
            <li> the liners are not smooth, but if I heat them up a bit I can get it to work..</li>
            <li> I tried a few coats and no luck.</li>
            <li> but I got green instead of purple.</li>
            <li> Wish they had a green and a purple in the set though.  </li>
            <li> My gold liner was dried out.</li>
            <li> The blue one is dried up (useless)...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them being dry or broken.</li>
            <li> One of the applicators were broken, and several of the eyeliners were dried out!!</li>
            <li> My sister is obsessed with make-up, especially eye-liner.</li>
            <li> The black liquid eye linear was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> They are hard to get off</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I feel like if this came with working liquid it make have bumped this to a four at least.     </li>
            <li> The liquid part of the bronze/brown color (not to be confused with the gold) was all dried up and am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I got green and no purple!!!</li>
            <li> The purple bulb was broken off-so I have no way of getting to the liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Copper - Sadly my liquid liner was completely broken.</li>
            <li> Flashy packaging that is not up to par.</li>
            <li> So sad  </li>
            <li> I used it the other day and had a terrible allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Purple - The biggest disappointment of the group.</li>
            <li> Liner &amp; pencil very faint</li>
            <li> wast your money, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> - I hate it when they offer and then don&#x27;t follow through.</li>
            <li> these are the worst.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very unhappy with this product!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these Kleancolor Eyeliners.  Will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Really The pigment is not good in either the top or bottom applicators.</li>
            <li> My sister bought these for me as a gift for my birthday and they couldn&#x27;t be better. We were a little skeptical about the price but the colors were so pretty we bought them anyway. .I am so happy we did. These are great. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them being dry or broken. They go on very easy and show up very well on my olive skin. They are hard to get off but they can sorta peal off like latex. The only issue I have ran in to so far is that the pencil at the top is lose but they are twisted pencils any way so it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> Great!!  Waterproof  stays on all day. Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Gorgeous bold colors, I got what I asked for.</li>
            <li> These metallic eye liners are awesome.. I love how you can use the liquid,  but that each of them come with a mini eye pencil too in case you want to apply it with a pencil. Best of both worlds, are really cute design bottles :)</li>
            <li> My sister is obsessed with make-up, especially eye-liner. So, this gift was perfect for her. It shipped quickly and she loves the bold colors.</li>
            <li> There really good and the colors are so bight and exact I love them</li>
            <li> 1st I only received 3 of the 6 colors. I found the product to be cheap and in bad condition upon arrival. The bottles where chipped and the regular eyeliner fell out of base when I opened it for the first time, making it unusable . I will never recommend this item and will never go threw this seller again. I am extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The Bottles were dry and empty! All 6 of them. This was a gift for my daughter and I was so embarrassed to have given her such a shoddy product! these are the worst. Buyer beware......</li>
            <li> Only gave 3  stars because 3 arrived  broke but  the ones I&#x27;ve used  I adore. Will be buying these again</li>
            <li> Uck.....I should have known better!! Flashy packaging that is not up to par. I LOVE makeup, and probably have enough for 3 lifetimes, so I know my stuff. The bottles are awkward,the bottom bulb a liquid, the sharp end a small pencil. The purple bulb was broken off-so I have no way of getting to the liquid liner. I did like the blue and silver liquid, but it doesn&#x27;t remove like normal liner. It&#x27;s almost like you used spray paint, and is a job to get off.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t want to be that rough to remove makeup so close to my eyes!! I could see how this stuff could easily bother anyone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line(pun intended), don&#x27;t do it! I know the price is good, but, I don&#x27;t see myself using any of these for all day use, so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wast your money, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> the product is really nice, but the silver and golden is not used much, so went to waste</li>
            <li> This is some totally wicked eyeliner it&#x27;s so chic and different from all the other eyeliners</li>
            <li> very beautiful and easy to put on colors are very beautiful shows very well.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful eyeliner and pencil.  Complete coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> overall a very good product but I never got the purple, instead I got teal.</li>
            <li> The colors are Nice. The pencil alone doesn&#x27;t have quite enough pigment to show nicely but paired with it&#x27;s liquid part, it does show up enough.  I personally don&#x27;t care for the brush for the liquid liner because it&#x27;s a bit harder to get a clean and precise line.  One of the brush ends broke while trying to dip it back in for more liquid so they aren&#x27;t as durable as I wished but for the price and amount it came with I will make do.</li>
            <li> Took a couple of layers to show up as brightly as I wanted.  The blue was nice and bright but not garish.</li>
            <li> I thought from the explanation that it was going to be a metallic, liquid eyeliner that I could use like a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.  It is a cheap waxy 1/4 size pencil that is not metallic or glittery by any means.  I intended to use it for face painting&lt;br /&gt;for Halloween - not going to be able to use it.  I suppose it would be okay for someone who wanted to use it as regular eye pencil but it doesnt last even the day.&lt;br /&gt;Lot of Flash casing with no substance the bulb part is just a stand for a 1/4 size pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Also they mentioned some earrings. Never got those - although I could care less - I hate it when they offer and then don&#x27;t follow through.</li>
            <li> I really like creating different looks with these. So much fun. I get lots of complements on my eyes when I use them.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when these arrived... But that lasted a whole 5mins. The Black one arrived broken had to try to glue the wand back on (still working on it)... The blue one is dried up (useless)... And the ones that did work when applied to the eye they dried and then looked cracked on the eyes lids... I got green and no purple!!! That&#x27;s the one I was most looking forward to... the liners are not smooth, but if I heat them up a bit I can get it to work.. No at all pleased with this purchase... Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it even if you&#x27;re in an eye liner jam.. Rather not spend the money or time using these..</li>
            <li> I mainly was looking for a nice copper liner. I stumbled upon this one and thought it looked fun!    These are all duo&#x27;s with a liquid liner and a smal pencil in the top cap. I think some colors were nice, where others fell flat.    Black - This was kind of dull. I usually prefer a jet black, and I felt like this was not that dark. Cute, just not my taste.  Silver and Gold - Both the liquid and the pencil of these two showed much more than I expected  Blue - This was the prettiest of the bunch I think. Unfortunately it needed multiple coats before it was visible, but it was a really nice shade of jewel blue.  Purple - The biggest disappointment of the group. The color was beautiful, but when you try to put it on both from the pencil and the liquid, you can&#x27;t see anything. I tried a few coats and no luck. So sad  Copper - Sadly my liquid liner was completely broken. The whole piece arrived broken off inside. I did however get to use the pencil and that was a very pretty shade and shows up nicely. I feel like if this came with working liquid it make have bumped this to a four at least.     It&#x27;s fun, and a decent price, but not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I order this make-up for my daughter as a gift. One of the applicators were broken, and several of the eyeliners were dried out!! My daughter was very unhappy with this product!! I would love to get a full refund so I can purchase her some more make-up!! She loves make-up!! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Mixed bag - really liked all of the liquid colors - but one was stuck and had to use a pliers to open, another the brush portion was stuck and broken. So out of the six, only four were usable. Once applied it would stay for days, peeling off if not taken off, not rubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warning is that it takes some eyelashes with it when you take it off, so I end up wearing it less than I would otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil portions were not at all special - no better or different from other pencil liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can recommend buying them, but you&#x27;ll probably find you don&#x27;t wear them as often.</li>
            <li> Okay I do really like them. Nice application, both pencil and liquid, but I didn&#x27;t receive the correct colors. I was expecting the colors in the photo but I got green instead of purple. I was most excited for the purple. Please dont make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> These are even better than I expected&#x27; The colors are pretty and vibrant without looking cheap or childish. Creates a great look.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely stunning and even better than expected considering the price.  My daughter even asks to borrow them.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and they show up really well on my darker skin tone. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the little pencils are not very secure and they keep falling out. I have to watch them closely or they will get destroyed. The metallics are awesome and they don&#x27;t run at all!</li>
            <li> Product peals off easily,</li>
            <li> These are all amazing and are very durable even after water contact! Just MAKE SURE YOU TEST THEM ALL OUT! The liquid part of the bronze/brown color (not to be confused with the gold) was all dried up and am unable to use it. Other than that, amazing product! Colors are vivid and metallic looking. Very happy despite the liquid brown being dried up.</li>
            <li> Just as described by seller.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery very satisfied</li>
            <li> The only things I dislike about this product is you tend to lose the liner plugged into the top of the liquid liner case, and on occasion I&#x27;ve had issues with the actual liquid liner case falling apart. Other than that, i love these colors. They are so dramatic, last all day, and look beautiful!</li>
            <li> These colors are dull, and the product cakes quickly and does not go on well.  I would recommend spending more for better quality.  A bargain isn&#x27;t always a bargain.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but pigments are not very strong it takes several layers to show up even the dark colors</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with these. Several of them were already broken when they came, and the colors were far lighter than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have a set and gifted a set to a friend. Love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, the colors are pretty and somewhat bright. The only negative is that when I received them, they were falling apart a little.</li>
            <li> the liquid eyeliner is beautiful! i was suprised to find it was a PENCIL AND LIQUID in One!!!! thought that was really awesome lol...the pencil isnt as shiny as the liner but it still is a nice shade no doubt. im very happy with this purchase and the delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> These are great!!  The one end applies like a paint.  You can go over it as well to soften it.  The other end is a pencil type liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with them and would certainly purchase again.  Wish they had a green and a purple in the set though.  There are two different blue shades even though the photo looks like one is purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the bottles!  Really easy to take along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liner removes well at the end of the day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased and will definately order another set.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors show up nice, and are buildable, but the formula is super goopy. I can&#x27;t even use the gold because it&#x27;s so think and won&#x27;t apply in a nice line. They do dry rather thick though and I notice them quite a bit while wearing it.</li>
            <li> True to the color you see online also long wearing and very pretty. Use make up remover to soak this stuff off, or you might lose your eye lashes.    Did not receive free \\&quot;random color\\&quot; earrings... which is fine by me.    Update:  Flimsy, not a surprise. An eyeliner stick fell out of top and one of the brushes broke off in the bottle on the third use.</li>
            <li> On of them way dry when it arrived.</li>
            <li> works for what i need. wish it was not a brush</li>
            <li> I am in love with these! Great color and long lasting. Showed a few days early with a cute pair of earnings!</li>
            <li> wow. Just wow. Vivid colors. Long lasting. Love the duo quality of it.</li>
            <li> I got a teal color instead of a purple, which was the reason why I bought this in the first place. Other than that, the colors are nice and none of them came broken or empty.</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors and they fit nicely in hand.</li>
            <li> Just got these today, and omg the colors are so pretty in their metallic ways! I like the added pencil liner as well in the handle. Did not know that was there until one came open on me. I am going to really enjoy using these for the rest of the summer!</li>
            <li> The black liquid eye linear was broken when I got it. The upside is that I didn&#x27;t know that there was eye linear with it too.</li>
            <li> fun colors and I love the Pencil at the tips</li>
            <li> Liner &amp; pencil very faint</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new found eyeliner manufacturer and supplier.  The colors are very vibrant and long lasting. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I was genuinely impressed with the quality. Stayed on for hours, no smudging, SUPER bright colors.Definitely will buy again. 💕</li>
            <li> Love all of the colors</li>
            <li> Liquid pigmentation is ok but pencil doesn&#x27;t have good pigmentation....</li>
            <li> Great colors. Awesome bottles.</li>
            <li> My gold liner was dried out.</li>
            <li> When I got mine two of them were pretty much empty? There wasn&#x27;t a leak or eyeliner on anything they came fine in the package but for some reason they seem empty. Then again the other ones don&#x27;t feel like there is a whole lot in them. Plus the rest don&#x27;t go on smoothly. Maybe I just ended up with a crappy pack but for that I will not order more.</li>
            <li> The pencil part is located in the top and tends to fall out when using the liquid applicator.</li>
            <li> The pencil is beautifully pigmented, and although the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t seem to be waterproof, it took a bit of scrubbing to get it off from where i tested it on my wrist. Application is pleasant, and I have had no  problems with this product so far! I am very happy with this purchase. (Oh and the earrings are adorable, the sparkles are so cute I can&#x27;t get over it. :D )</li>
            <li> so amazing ill buy more later</li>
            <li> Great quality and I am into my self manicures for decades. The eye makeup is good quality too.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for this deal of liquid liner plus pencil.  Color as expected. Works well.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is alright.  Not as metallic as I thought it would be.  It makes your eyelashes clumpy if you get it on them. For the price I would definitely buy it again though.  Colors are fun.  No earrings but who cares.  Didn&#x27;t need a cheap pair to turn my ears colors anyway.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and vibrant, would be an excellent bargain but the blue eyeliner brush was damaged when I received it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Product is very cheap and waxy, it comes in cute plastic containers, not worth purchasing!! Was delivered as scheduled. Would never buy again</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. Sometimes hard to remove. I would recommend this product. Love the blue.</li>
            <li> The product is a little gummy and the bottles are only about half full of not less. The color are pretty though.</li>
            <li> Changing previous review, and glad to have chance.  I was not opening the bottom portion, only top.  But now have discovered what a great product it is - the metallic eyeliners are fabulous, and am enjoying!!</li>
            <li> This makeup is rancid. I used it the other day and had a terrible allergic reaction. My eyelids at first stuck together.  Then my face around my eyes puffed up like a puffer fish. It looks like I was punched in the face. As the day progressed and after I washedoff the makeup, my eye lids and under eyes began to dry out and wrinkle. I then got a massive headache and a sore throat.  I would not recommend using this product.  It&#x27;s hideous and my eyes and face burn.</li>
            <li> Fine line, dries quickly, love the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to liquid eye liner so I thought I would try it. I don&#x27;t particularly like that it clumps my lashes together or pulls some out when trying to get it off. But I do like the pencils and the bottles fun shapes. I think I will stick to the pencils from now on. The only color I&#x27;ve tried so far is black and it shows up pretty good.</li>
            <li> these are AMAZING. I love the ALL DAY WEAR and the color is vibrant. The brush for the liquid liner could be a little more firm. But I really like this product</li>
            <li> You can break these up as stocking  stuffers, Easter baskets or just give then to that person who likes to try new things with their makeup! The colors are beautiful and well worth the money!</li>
