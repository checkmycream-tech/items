            <li> I was disappointed when I received the product.  Nothing special and could have paid a lot less than that.  I will use it since I don&#x27;t want the hustle of going to the post office.  However, I won&#x27;t be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> excellent quality cotton balls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using these in my RDA, and I love it! So far so good! No aftertaste! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I do the Vape thing and I now have enough cotton to last a loooong time.</li>
            <li> they are rolled a little too tight making them hard.</li>
            <li> The balls are not quite soft and also have the quality of all the others cotton balls that you can buy at any store. I have bought \\&quot;organic\\&quot; cotton balls in the past, so I thought these would be kind of the sort I used, but nothing similar. I really expected more..</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s awesome for vaping I use it in my Rebuildable RDA and there is no after taste and it&#x27;s really absorbing for my e juice I would recommend this to my friends.</li>

            <li> Distinctly inferior product.  Had no idea cotton balls could be so cheesy.  Not much cotton in each ball, and it hadn&#x27;t been carded sufficiently so that it could be carefully pulled apart to make it somewhat bigger.  I threw them away!</li>
            <li> Nice cottonballs.  Love the organic fact.  More money but you pay what you get</li>
            <li> I use these for making e-cig wicks and petroleum jelly fire starters sealed in drinking straws. I realize this has nothing to do with the target market. That said, they work great for my use.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it arrived before it was supposed to  Thanks</li>
            <li> I got these to use as a wick for a nano coil in my Kayfun Lite. Expectations have been exceeded by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No taste, wonderful flavor from all my liquids, great vapor production too. Spent $5 and I&#x27;m set for years! Shipping was very fast as well, even arrived on a Sunday. Seller was OxKom. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
