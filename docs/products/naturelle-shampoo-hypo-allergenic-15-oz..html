            <li>This shampoo used with the conditioner work great.</li>
            <li>and it works great for cleaning but adds to the softness and lack of body.</li>

            <li>This shampoo made my scalp feel great but didnt give me the volume I need</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m happy that it has no scent.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses good.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>It is the best so far of the Hypoallergenic shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that you are glad someone designed.</li>
            <li>My head doesn&#x27;t break out or flake and my hair feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li>but it is overall very good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling healthy or clean until I use my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this shampoo works great.</li>
            <li>The botanical extracts in this shampoo made my hair feel clean and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, but it does get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li>This is a mild shampoo that does not cause an allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean with one washing, leaves it pretty and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was worth a shot for a non itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Really is fragrance free, I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and so many products say hypoallergenic but still have fragrance in them, this is first product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother me,</li>
            <li>had eczema on my hand, right where I put my shampoo before I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>My curly hair is hydrated, soft, stays in place, and clean!  </li>
            <li>I seem to be more allergic to this than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair more greasy than before washing it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything in it is actually free and clear,</li>
            <li>It has been a huge help knowing that I was sensitive to certain shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>So while I try and type while scratching my the heck out of scalp and avoiding the nice lil contact dermatitis rash it left, I say to you - don&#x27;t buy this if you are sensitive to SLS.</li>
            <li>I use this product and it works very well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, along with its conditioner, caused much hair breakage.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and my scalp seems to be much happier now.</li>
            <li>I purchased two bottles of the Naturelle Hypo-Allergenic Shampoo since it was advertised as being extra gentle for sensitive skin and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I have a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong, but afterwards my head got a bit more itchy after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>the flower and geranium oil in this product made my hair very soft without any residue left on my hair.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive, and this helps to prevent the dry, scaly, red rashes that I sometimes get from normal shampoo.  </li>

            <li> I use this product and it works very well. It does leave you a little dry but it is overall very good.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on my husbands account. I have always had allergies and it is hard to find a hypo-allergenic shampoo that works, doesn&#x27;t give me dandruff and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. This shampoo used with the conditioner work great. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of the Naturelle Hypo-Allergenic Shampoo since it was advertised as being extra gentle for sensitive skin and it is fragrance free. The botanical extracts in this shampoo made my hair feel clean and&lt;br /&gt;refreshed. I only used a small amount of shampoo but it lathered up really well, the flower and geranium oil in this product made my hair very soft without any residue left on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother who has multiple chemical sensitivity disorder (mcsd) as a Christmas gift. Mom is allergic to bleach, hair dye, perfume, hand soaps, etc to the point that those products could through her into anaphylactic shock.  This product has 0 aroma and caused mom 0 problems. Now looking for the conditioner to match!</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t notice anything wrong, but afterwards my head got a bit more itchy after using this shampoo. I believe it&#x27;s due to the decyl glucoside, not the laurel sulfates because another shampoo I used before that had decyl glucoside (from coconut)  in it, and it also irritated my head. Maybe it won&#x27;t have the same effects on everyone, but it had it on me. sorry</li>
            <li> I seem to be more allergic to this than regular shampoo. It also left my hair more greasy than before washing it. Oh well, it was worth a shot for a non itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo on the market.  It gets my hair clean with one washing, leaves it pretty and shiny.  Plus my head doesn&#x27;t itch with it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo, along with its conditioner, caused much hair breakage.  I had to quit using it.</li>
            <li> I have horrible sensitivity to smells and hair products. This is one of those products that you are glad someone designed. I buy it all the time. I have very fine hair and it works great for cleaning but adds to the softness and lack of body.</li>
            <li> no fragrances and got rid of some irritation on my back from my prior shampoo and conditioner. I wash it twice then use Naturelle conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo but boy was I disappointed. This shampoo has a ton of SLS in it and while I am not allergic to it or it&#x27;s related ingredients, it tears my skin up. Try as I might, I could not find an ingredient list for this product but desperate for a break from making my own shampoo, I bought it anyway. I focused on the \\&quot;paraben free/fragrance free\\&quot; etc , the things I am truly allergic too. Bad idea. So while I try and type while scratching my the heck out of scalp and avoiding the nice lil contact dermatitis rash it left, I say to you - don&#x27;t buy this if you are sensitive to SLS. If you aren&#x27;t , then go for it. *scratch scratch scratch*</li>
            <li> The best hypo-a I have found</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I have a sensitive scalp.  I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and my scalp seems to be much happier now.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to quanternuim in shampoo. This is a mild shampoo that does not cause an allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li> Really is fragrance free, I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and so many products say hypoallergenic but still have fragrance in them, this is first product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother me,</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  My face is very sensitive, and this helps to prevent the dry, scaly, red rashes that I sometimes get from normal shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, but it does get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this shampoo works great. My head doesn&#x27;t break out or flake and my hair feels nice and clean. I have been through dozens of shampoos. I think I have found the one!</li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses good. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling healthy or clean until I use my conditioner. It is the best so far of the Hypoallergenic shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used and I have used at least 4 different brands. It doesn&#x27;t bother my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp feel great but didnt give me the volume I need</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had eczema on my hand, right where I put my shampoo before I put it in my hair. I decided to try this product.  I have not had a single eczema flare up since I have been using this shampoo!  It has been a huge help knowing that I was sensitive to certain shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that I have curly hair which is prone to dryness.  I can only use this shampoo 1-2X a week or else my hair gets dried out and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will continue using this product as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this line of products.  THANK YOU Naturelle for finally being a product that WORKS!  My curly hair is hydrated, soft, stays in place, and clean!  I could not be happier with the results.  And best of all is the PRICE!  I know not everything works for everyone, but this works for me and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> I Like this product because it is hypo-allergenic and not just dermatologist tested!&lt;br /&gt;In order for something to be dermatologist tested all they have to do is ask a Dermatologist if they like the product!&lt;br /&gt;Everything in it is actually free and clear,No more itchy scalp!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to clean well.  And I&#x27;m happy that it has no scent.  Seems to last a long time.</li>
