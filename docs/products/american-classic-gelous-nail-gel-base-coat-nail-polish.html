            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is also the best top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my gelous!</li>
            <li>It works so well :) Very happy with this!</li>
            <li>A 7 day gel manicure at the salon would cost easily $20, so $8 on a bottle of this magnificent miracle worker is a bargain if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Good bye</li>
            <li>It still is a good coat</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>but I find this is just as good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It still looked almost as good as the day I applied.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a led or uv lamp and good gel.</li>
            <li>But..I purchased it because I read a lot of good reviews on this product...</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>so it is really good.</li>
            <li>Great top coat, keeps polish adhered and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love being able to do my own gels!!</li>
            <li>THIS ISNT A TOP COAT PEOPLE!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>Why isn&#x27;t this stuff talked about more?!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to grown nails since i hit 50; now I can again!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS POLISH!</li>
            <li>Increases the wear of the your favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget a really good top coat.</li>
            <li>I found a Pinterest about how to create your own gel nails..</li>
            <li>I applied the top coat again and I was good.</li>
            <li>One or two coats of good quality top coat</li>
            <li>they do look nice.</li>
            <li>but it gets kind of chunky and globby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that after removing this product, just do a nice oil or paraffin treatment just in case or apply so cuticle oil</li>
            <li>The truth is none of them is really effective.</li>
            <li>I will say the application process takes kind of a while</li>
            <li>And if drying is a problem , I use a quick coat and it works great afterwards...</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>BUT I don&#x27;t feel like my nails are super strong, nothing incredible.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, though, I am impressed so far and will continue to use it with my at home manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think that top coat doesn&#x27;t play nice with my China glaze polish because it shrunk the polish on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think my nails have ever looked better.  </li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is INM Out The Door.</li>
            <li>I use my own basecoat, then this Gelous Nail, then my color, then top it with another coat of the Gelous Nail</li>
            <li>Easy to take off too!</li>
            <li>I painted my nails a week ago and they are still going strong!</li>
            <li>No chips for two weeks, and still going strong!</li>
            <li>The verdict is still out, I saw this on pinterest and had to try the &amp;#34;at home gel nails&amp;#34; I also bought the suggested top coat (AMAZING top coat).  </li>
            <li>Well for about the first month Gelous was working GREAT.</li>
            <li>It works so well and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CAP THE EDGE OF YOUR NAILS WITH EACH AND EVERY LAYER OF POLISH.  </li>
            <li>it works fine and gives my nail quite a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I wear it as an overcoat UNDER my top coat (does that make sense?)</li>
            <li>Top with favorite top</li>
            <li>I have always been one to love painting my nails, but I can&#x27;t stand when it chips...</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>better than shellac at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Best if you use Seche Vite Top Coat it dries instantly and lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use mine as a top coat</li>
            <li>such an awesome alternative to getting gel nails at the salon.  </li>
            <li>coat of your fav top coat (I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>seche vite and julep top coats</li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>Use a shiny top coat to maintain it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li>The shine &amp; wear is phenomenal (picture below is 8 days &amp; counting ).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t discolor or shrink your polish, plus it keeps my rhinestones from falling off much better than Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>I truly recommend this brand to anyone that loves nail art &amp; anyone who likes wearing their polish for more than a week.</li>
            <li>Not as durable as a salon gel manicure,  but definitely more durable than anything else I have ever used at home.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps as many of the tips I&#x27;ve read in reviews of products has helped me.</li>
            <li>i really wanted this to be great...</li>
            <li>but its okay...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed for better results.</li>
            <li>I love using this as a topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I would layer gelous, nail polish, gelous, nail polish, then Selche as my top coat.</li>
            <li>Magically, though, the color does not transfer into the gelous.  </li>
            <li>Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do one coat Gelous, one coat nail color, one coat gelous, one coat nail color, top coat</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliment.  </li>
            <li>I will reorder better than nothing</li>
            <li>and I love them!I</li>
            <li>need more time to evaluate this product but it seems to be working to a degree.  </li>
            <li>Layer it as a Basecoat and a top coat for gel like nails</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd bottle works great!</li>
            <li>I thought this was just OK.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I tried this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I think you would love it too.</li>
            <li>and then a top coat -</li>
            <li>This nail polish stays on for 2 or more weeks.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, however I do use my hands more than most people.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>Love it use it</li>
            <li>I used it the way everybody is saying to use it, gelous, color, gelous, color, top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>but I still don&#x27;t get more than 7 days outof manicure...</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to get this to work for me.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Put a coat between each coat of color and on top.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Then, from what I read on Pinterest you are supposed to apply a top coat, but of</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>This polish is okay.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a top coat for the shine.</li>
            <li>I still absolutely love this stuff and hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that is part of the reason it keeps the polish on</li>
            <li>The best part is it comes up with regular acetone and</li>
            <li>but that is much better than the severe damage salon gel polish was doing from the scraping process.</li>
            <li>I will try again with Essie polish and change my review if it lasts 7 days :)</li>
            <li>I suppose better nutrition has to be the answer.</li>
            <li>then 1 top</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with this product is that with some nail polishes the nail polishes will peel off in a day or two, even with using a top coat.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this over nail color, then use one layer of a shiny top coat over this.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>Make sure to coat the tips of the nail as well.</li>
            <li>then two coats of my color, another Gelous and then a top coat.</li>
            <li>as a nurse I wash my hands many times a day.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it worth every penny!!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I use it as a top coat too because of how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Why spend more when you can get this easy to use product.</li>
            <li>and therefore they are able to grow and do not break as easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and can be used as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li>They are strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I added my favorite polish color to Gelous and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat not a base.  </li>
            <li>I would think it would work better with a UV light.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and works great.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply it directly to clean nails.</li>
            <li>Which is longer than most nail polishes last, but still is all the great when compared to shellac.</li>
            <li>I find my polish to be a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for a while afterward, making it easy to dent.  </li>
            <li>easy to remove</li>
            <li>Chips off too easily.</li>
            <li>I can use my nails for things and they stay strong with no chipping or ripping of the nail.  </li>
            <li>I have never wanted to give a rave review more than I do right now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As long as this is used in between coats of polish and then on the top it work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li>Worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Shimmery ones are best because it is less noticeable when it starts chipping or fading at the edges.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Clear top coat (quick drying is</li>
            <li>BUT for best results...I use the Gelous then any nail polish color/brand...then repeat (Gelous and colored nail polish) after they seem to be somewhat dried</li>
            <li>Great product made my polish last longer</li>
            <li>I liked that i could peel this off in a whole piece because once my nails start to chip I peel off my polish.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to make your polish last all week!!</li>
            <li>Bought this as an alternative to buying a UV light for gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li>One coat of your choice of basecoat (my go-to is Revlon colorstay gel smooth nail</li>
            <li>no shrinkage and fantastic</li>
            <li>It feels tacky for about an 2 hours even after putting it in an LED light</li>
            <li>But after it hardens, my nails look fantastic and my polish lasts without chipping.  </li>
            <li>Easy clean up but did lose some of the polish.</li>
            <li>light gel coat  </li>
            <li>Light gel coat.  </li>
            <li>Light gel coat.  </li>
            <li>Best gel base coat love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVEEE this :) :)</li>
            <li>It was easy to peel off in full pieces.</li>
            <li>and Im sure it will do exactly as espected</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I love this basecoat, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for it!</li>
            <li>this stuff actually stays on my fingernails for many days - and nothing I have found has been able to do that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one downfall: you have to be willing to sit around with the many polish coats drying for around an hour.</li>
            <li>I found that it is best to dry the color polish with a blow dryer for a while before applying the top coat so that the color is partially dry and doesn&#x27;t bleed through when the top coat is applied.</li>
            <li>Clean nails&lt;</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>: Yes, this stuff is great at resisting chips, but if it does happen to chip or get a deep scratch, it will probably end up peeling off a good bit of extra polish with it as opposed to just chipping right where the damage is.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited.</li>
            <li>:) And third, this may seem like an aint-nobody-got-time-for-that kind of thing, but for a week-long, chip-free manicure that I can do while watching a 30 minute episode of something on Netflix, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>I use a fast drying top coat (In a Hurry by Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>One coat of this, one coat of nail polish, another coat of this, one coat of nail polish, fast drying top coat</li>
            <li>However, it is nothing like a true salon gel nail manicure</li>
            <li>( if your color is a one coater skip this step and go straight to your top coat)&lt;br</li>
            <li>i should have known there was no way that was true, but i was hopeful.</li>
            <li>it also seemed to really stick to my nails and make it so that pieces of the top layer of my nails peeled off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite for nail art.</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing for me, making my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li>I did not receive a full bottle.</li>
            <li>As a homemaker and full time parent, I decided to put this product through the wringer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, it does work.</li>
            <li>I loved getting gel nails done at the salon on my regular length nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super hard on my nails and this stays on a full 3-7 days, which is awesome for me.</li>
            <li>others about the product and converted many new fans!</li>
            <li>Seriously the best stuff I have tried.</li>
            <li>I never painted my finger nails because the polish always chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this as a cheap substitute for salon gel manicures for those who like to dabble in doing their own nails.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>They also have very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>That fact that my nail color last that long really impressed me.</li>
            <li>Really does hold polish on!!</li>
            <li>I will totally be ordering more for myself, sisters and friends!</li>
            <li>The formula is thick like gel, easy to work with &amp; completely levels out creating the perfect finish for your nail designs.</li>
            <li>Works amazing when latered with regular nail polish!!!!</li>
            <li>its just like a gel manicure except without the UV light which can be very harmful.</li>
            <li>So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and they still look freshly painted.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>OMG I love this my nails look like its been professionally done.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do more than a clear coat...</li>
            <li>On natural nails it can be used as top and bottom coat.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So nice to have a product actually WORK!</li>
            <li>Well worth the $6.</li>
            <li>This is truly great for a lasting manicure at home which looks professional.  </li>
            <li>but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>But with this product my first manicure lasted a full seven days</li>
            <li>Then use a quick dry shiny top coat!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I will most definitely keep this in product handy for those special occasions such as vacations, holidays and so on.</li>
            <li>Really happy with the purchase as it is very easy to apply and not at all expensive when compared to getting a gel color at a nail spa.</li>
            <li>and it came right off.</li>
            <li>My nail polish came right off hours after it was put on</li>
            <li>I even do my nails right before bed.</li>
            <li>as it makes my nails feel, I am equally if not more so impressed by its performance as a clear coat.</li>
            <li>(side note, I usually find supplements (like viviscal) more effective than nail polish treatments)</li>
            <li>Used many layers of this polish with a quick dry top coat &amp; normal colored polish, and it literally stayed on 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told</li>
            <li>Also, if you have a dark nail polish, the layers can be cumbersome time wise.  </li>
            <li>they get a certain length and then just break!  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 8/27/15  I used this with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat and my manicure is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>pros: when done correctly, this is a phenomenal substitute for a professional gel mani (or really any mani).</li>
            <li>There are claims of it making a manicure last up to 12 days with chip free, peel free results.</li>
            <li>but I like to make sure my nails stay as nice as possible for as long as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I attached pictures from last Sunday, right before I took my nail polish off and re-did them.</li>
            <li>i very much recommend this gel coat.</li>
            <li>My wife and Daughters really like this product!</li>
            <li>i love how my nails look when i go to get gel manicures at salons, but i was starting to worry that i was stripping my nails each time i would take the stuff</li>
            <li>I always end up with perfect nails and usually take my polish off simply because I want a color change rather than because it&#x27;s chipping.</li>
            <li>First coat of color/polish</li>
            <li>Top coat dries instantly and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Makes my nails really pretty and shiny</li>
            <li>I always chip polish (first day) and</li>
            <li>I had to soak the bottle in some polish remover to be able to open.  </li>
            <li>I need to do more testing with different brand combinations.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more from this seller...</li>
            <li>and i really like it!</li>
            <li>Then I put the nails under a uv light  for 4 to 8 minutes to finish  them for a truly professional job.</li>
            <li>I find that after a week or so that a light buffing with a soft cloth renews the shine.</li>
            <li>First try:</li>
            <li>Love it, makes my nail polish last over a week.</li>
            <li>My fingernail BROKE for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should invest in rubber gloves too ;).  </li>
            <li>No matter how many coats of this I put on, my nails still cracked the next day.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re such a Budapest, then gelous, and sally hasen intra-dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I had no cracking, chipping, or peeling till exactly on day seven.</li>
            <li>Put a layer of this in between each layer of color and then put this on top of the final coat of color.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t try hide my nails when pointing to something or doing something with my hands.</li>
            <li>First time I applied this polish, my manicure lasted for a week.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well to lengthen the life of a manicure.  </li>
            <li>: lasts longer than regular polish, it&#x27;s easier to apply (it&#x27;s all more forgiving, compared to Gels) and easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: I&#x27;d recommend using a cuticle softener and being sure to push back your cuticles.</li>
            <li>However the first time I bathe, it begins to peel.</li>
            <li>I definitely allow more drying time and I finish with drying drops or drying spray.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping, thank you so much, a friend gave me some of this</li>
            <li>so this is about as fast right</li>
            <li>Sure, by that point my cuticles are a mess, but the Gelous keeps the polish I put on securely in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Essie Gel Setter top coat is the only one that really works for me, so that&#x27;s what I use now.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is good, not doubt, but you&#x27;re only gonna get an extra day or two of wear with it.</li>
            <li>I got it at Sally&#x27;s, along with Seche Vite top coat which I&#x27;ve been wanting to try for a long time.</li>
            <li>I should mention that the fairly cheap Wet n Wild polish I used held up better than my China Glaze.</li>
            <li>Works really well to thicken the nail and, when used as a layering between coats of color, really gives the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect!</li>
            <li>far my nail polish has lasted around 5 full days with no chips.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using more then one coat, I actually used 3.&lt;br /&gt;First used a nail strengthener, coat of gelous nail, nail color, gelous nail, nail color, clear top coat and a last coat of gelous.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend this product to anyone that paints their nails on a regular basis and does not want to ruin their nails or change the color more that once a week or pay for the pros to do it.</li>
            <li>It made my manicures last 4-5 days, which is AWESOME for me because previously my nails would chip the first or second day.</li>
            <li>It also is easily removed with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Can be removed easily using standard nail polish remover</li>
            <li>I also have a problem with my nails cracking and peeling when they get a certain length.</li>
            <li>I use a nail dehydrator, then a coat of Gelous, two coats of colored polish, another coat of Gelous, and then Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Gelous, Color, Gelous, Color, Fast dry top coat.    </li>
            <li>It removes just fine with regular polish remover.</li>
            <li>For the price this stuff is actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, it makes doing your nails so much easier!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping this lasts long!!! :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, haven&#x27;t had enough time to really test it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the wide brush, so much easier to get an even coat.</li>
            <li>I really hope this stuff does what it promises.</li>
            <li>When I stopped making weekly trips to the salon my nails really suffered.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product, I no longer have either one of these problems.</li>
            <li>I used this with Sinful Colors &amp;#34;Cinderella&amp;#34; which is a light blue glittered polish.</li>
            <li>I really want to try this with OPI Neon nail polishes because those chip on my nails within a day.</li>
            <li>Also my nails grew so much and are so much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>IT DRIES FAST AND GLASS</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an intense  color but stays on for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very protective and it lasts for awhile</li>
            <li>As much as she does her nails</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It lasted about three days vefore the tips of my nails started chipping, without doing much of anything except maybe washing my hands.  </li>
            <li>and i wanted to try this so that i could save money and also not damage my nails as much.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice that this product keeps my nail polish on longer.</li>
            <li>Yes, I danced a happy dance for a broken nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep the polish on.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for a manicure that lasts 3-6 days.  </li>
            <li>So much for Gel nails.</li>
            <li>Its so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>you really have to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really compare to a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>This stuff also makes my fingernails and toenails much stronger</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had really wimpy nails.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And on top of everything, I was never really a fan of having to stick my hands into a UV &amp;#34;nail oven&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ll start to harden up much quicker.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep polish longer.</li>
            <li>With this process i get about 7-8 days out of my polish and they really are not chipped on the ends</li>
            <li>Takes ~5-6 days to start chipping (when worn on its own)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 medium coats are enough to get your nails smooth &amp; shiny&lt;</li>
            <li>Reasonable dent-resistance while drying&lt;br</li>
            <li>Polish lasts much longer with Gelous application.</li>
            <li>Really does help nail polish stay on longer ...</li>
            <li>Only challenge is figuring out which polishes won&#x27;t bubble up when used in conjunction with it; so far the winners are OPI and most Loreal and Sally Hanson polishes.</li>
            <li>one thing that DID make my nails long and strong were gel manicures</li>
            <li>well this did help my nails grow strong and long when i wore it alone.</li>
            <li>Pretty good last longer than normal but not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and will dry relatively fast, but I did not feel it made my nails</li>
            <li>I was so excited and thought I had finally found my go-to!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I also ended up buying this quick dry top coat from American Classic as well</li>
            <li>But compared with the time I would&#x27;ve spent at the salon, driving there and back, and paying a whole lot more, I think it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Just make sure you let each coat dry completely before adding another.</li>
            <li>so a lot of product gets wasted and makes cleaning less than ideal</li>
            <li>and I can work my full 12 hour shift at a hospital constantly washing my hands with out getting an embarrassing chip during the day.</li>
            <li>nail polish helps my nail color last so much longer than it would by just applying two coats of regular polish and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this product along with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat and following very specific application instructions, I was able to get my nail color to last exactly seven days before it even started chipping off.</li>
            <li>Multiple blogs and social media sites rave about how wonderful this product due to how long it extense a nail color manicure.</li>
            <li>Good get base; I have to say it doesn&#x27;t cling to my nails as long as I was hoping, but better than many</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly with minimal chemical smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this stuff is an OK alternative to an actual gel manicure but definitely doesn&#x27;t replace it in longevity.  </li>
            <li>Now looks fabulous, lasting one week so far.</li>
            <li>The only problem i had was it peeded off quickly</li>
            <li>So shiny and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Seriously - no chipping, no peeling - up to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I read up how this product can make your regular nail polish last longer, and have more of that &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect without having to use the gel/shellac polishes.</li>
            <li>but I have definitely noticed that it seems to work much better with sheer colors.</li>
            <li>I do one coat gelous, one coat regular nail polish, one coat gelous, 2nd coat regular nail polish, another coat gelous, finish with a quick drying high-end top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quick dryn( Seche Vite), and even a commercial dryer.</li>
            <li>I use 3-4 coats of this first, then a few coats of any nail polish, and clear coat on top</li>
            <li>and it is a good alternative to shellac, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so my hopes are quite high.</li>
            <li>It would have been a little more helpful to have instructions.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to prevent early chipping of nail polish.</li>
            <li>a normal manicure lasts for like a day if i&#x27;m cautious).</li>
            <li>(Normally I get two days tops.)</li>
            <li>most likely you&#x27;re using the wrong kind of nail polish.</li>
            <li>With putting this many coats of polish on, your polish is very thick and it&#x27;s super noticable at the cuticles when it grows out</li>
            <li>This get coat helps any nail color stay chip free for longer than any other top/base coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and it does make my polish chip free for a day or two extra but definitely not like a week longer or anything.</li>
            <li>Seems to dry quickly</li>
            <li>Also, if you have short nails like mine, make sure you drag each coat of this over the tips of your nails (basically painting a little on your fingertip skin, which you can then easily remove with acetone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it with a color coat because I normally prefer the natural look.</li>
            <li>It leaves my polish looking fresh for almost a week, and that is a long time for me.</li>
            <li>So I bought this probably about two months ago, and have been using Selche Vita, (not sure on the spelling) as a top coat.</li>
            <li>My first bottle is almost done and my mom&#x27;s only used it once.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t tested to see how many days past 7 it will go.</li>
            <li>It keeps my natural nails looking manicured for over a week!  </li>
            <li>I can only give 4 stars, because I just used it for the first time today, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells a little strong but whatever, it&#x27;s nailpolish</li>
            <li>But I recently saw this product on Pinterest, and decided to give it a shot because it was decently priced (cheaper if you buy straight from Sally&#x27;s Beauty).</li>
            <li>it off with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat  to dry your &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; instantly and keep it shiny</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t let it dry fast enough or is it because I use cheap color polish that it flakes off instead of actually chips.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions below carefully for that perfect gel like manicure ... DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID OF THE COATS</li>
            <li>She applied one clear coat then one polish color, then one coat gellous, another coat polish, and another coat gellous.</li>
            <li>My manicure has lasted for 10 days so far with no chips.  </li>
            <li>through 2 bottles so far</li>
            <li>This product has been able to keep my nail color in tact for at least a week if not longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had manicures last a whole week, which is unheard of with how often I was my hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like Gel UV, except to harsh light</li>
            <li>I opted with checking with a professional at a nail salon to see if it needed primer etc.  </li>
            <li>My manicure is now a week old and loss like I got it done a day ago</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and was pleased, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li>The old saying goes, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t believe everything you read on the internet&amp;#34; is the reason why I tried this product out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than actually going to the salon</li>
            <li>As Nails, Nailtiques, professional manicures, eating jello, vitamins...</li>
            <li>It helps my nail polish last longer and stay much shinier.</li>
            <li>Never really dried on the nails.  </li>
            <li>You have to complete the manicure as directed by applying a coat of this then a coat of your nail polish and repeat by layering.</li>
            <li>This base coat is the best out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used Gelous base coat as a top coat on the regular polish that&#x27;s put on acrylic nails for a while now and have had good results.</li>
            <li>Not the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used though.</li>
            <li>If you want a DIY gel manicure, this base coat is great for that!</li>
            <li>No different than any other basic top coat.</li>
            <li>Even if they don&#x27;t chip right away, they look dull and lose their shine right away.</li>
            <li>major con and minus one star is that this stuff starts to congeal and thicken in the bottle pretty quickly, especially if you keep it in a hot place</li>
            <li>Take alcohol or vinegar to your nails first then apply when dry.</li>
            <li>Depending on how many coats you apply, it also seriously thickens the nail.</li>
            <li>I have been doing the same exact routine and using the same polish that I had been using</li>
            <li>I get manicures maybe once every 4-5 months but try to paint my nails at home regularly (trying to break that nail-biting habit, per usual), and this has made my at-home attempts a million times more legit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my polish on a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>but now they are so healthy and LONG after going through a few bottles of this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent most of my life picking and biting at them, and then been ashamed of the mess I have on my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am pretty rough on my nails; lots of dishes, cleaning, yard work...</li>
            <li>it has wide brush and very convenient!</li>
            <li>This product has done everything that other products have promised, but for less (in most cases).</li>
            <li>I put sally hansen hard as nails - wraps on top of it for extra protection</li>
            <li>fast dry.</li>
            <li>that last pretty long.</li>
            <li>This product helps my DIY manicures last much longer than just painting my nails with polish only.  </li>
            <li>I was told to put on two coats of the Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat, then put on a coat of your favorite nail polish, another coat of the Gelous Nail Gel and then a Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>The brush is thick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with different top coats, with no top coat, with different polish brands.</li>
            <li>The only time it hasn&#x27;t completely ruined my mani as it dries is if I use it just as a clear coat over bare nails.</li>
            <li>worry about the layers, if you use Seche Vite it dries hard in seconds and super shine!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails.</li>
            <li>The process is a little time consuming, but well worth</li>
            <li>read in other reviews that this product may dry out the nails, on my first try I did not see that at all, my nails werehealthy and normal.  </li>
            <li>The only plus was that it made my nails super shiny, but other than that it was just like using a regular topcoat.</li>
            <li>For reference, before when I just used seche clear and vite, my polish would last two to three days.</li>
            <li>just a regular clear coat</li>
            <li>While this still isnt as long as real gel, it is a big improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something under $40 to give me a lasting clear shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far</li>
            <li>but mine didn&#x27;t last anywhere near the promised time.  </li>
            <li>Even then my polish can sometimes get prints/indentations in it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>My nails look professionally done and last for days if well cared for.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and normally can only go a day before my nails start chipping.</li>
            <li>Apply thin coat of favorite color.</li>
            <li>within two days it would chip with most colors... and after a few wks of using it it got really gooey and thick in the bottle and would leave air bubbles when i would apply it...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>This made my manicure last a full week but after continued use, my nails really dried out and started peeling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a professional expensive gel manicure, but it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li>One more thin coat of Nail Polish (and nail art, if you&#x27;re into it)&lt;br /&gt;J.</li>
            <li>Applied a thin layer of Northern Lights Hologram Top Coat for a sparkly affect (OPTIONAL)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a nail polish person because it always looks chipped and thin, but this keeps me on top of maintaining my nails.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, not tacky at all and dries quickly giving yoi rock hard nails that don&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>AMAZING)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, 7 coats of polish but it dries just as fast to the touch as any other manicure.</li>
            <li>but with other colors it didnt really prevent my polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>This base coat is so good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as tough as gel nail polish but very much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li>The very tip end of the nails wore down very slightly but it just made the manicure look better with a smoothed down tip.</li>
            <li>That might sound like a bad thing, but it means that it was finally strong enough to not tear, but break.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish far as I can tell...</li>
            <li>Serving as an important part in growing out my natural nails after leaving the world of acrylics behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and have never made it more than a few days without having to re-do my nails.</li>
            <li>Nothing is more frustrating than doing your nails and having them chip the next day.</li>
            <li>This method requires so many coats that it simply does not work with thick polish (thick from being old or just thick like many china glaze polishes or say, an Essie ballet slippers).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying for a second time and this time I filed my nail surface a bit and wiped down with rubbing alcohol hoping to get a better bond, not sure if that was the issue....  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I am following the instructions properly, but I do a base coat, let it dry, do my color, let it dry, do a top coat of clear shiny polish and the top it off with the gel again.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and makes your nails hard as rocks.</li>
            <li>Typically my manicures are chip free for about 2 days and unwearable by day 5 (with base coat, 2 coats of high end polish plus top coat, seche or out the door).</li>
            <li>It goes on thick, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It helps the manicure last longer,  but certainly not as long as they claim.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but using this base coat under my polish and then the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce on top made my nails look like I have a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to let each layer dry completely, or the color comes onto the brush.</li>
            <li>I have very weak nails and have tried many remedies.</li>
            <li>This gel really helps keep my clear polish in tact for at least a week.</li>

            <li> I was incredibly hopeful after reading the reviews, but haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li> When I use this, my manicure lasts incredibly longer than without its use.  </li>
            <li> My nails looked great and my polish stayed in perfect condition for well over a week.</li>
            <li> but I defiantly think this is a good ting to have in a collection!</li>
            <li> I can get a good week out of any color I choose when I use this under!</li>
            <li> It covers wonderfully and is fairly priced.  </li>
            <li> It comes out just as beautiful and durable as a salon gel manicure.</li>

            <li> This looks great going on.</li>
            <li> You will love it!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is also the best top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my gelous!</li>
            <li> It works so well :) Very happy with this!</li>
            <li> A 7 day gel manicure at the salon would cost easily $20, so $8 on a bottle of this magnificent miracle worker is a bargain if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Good bye</li>
            <li> It still is a good coat</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> but I find this is just as good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It still looked almost as good as the day I applied.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a led or uv lamp and good gel.</li>
            <li> But..I purchased it because I read a lot of good reviews on this product...</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> so it is really good.</li>
            <li> Great top coat, keeps polish adhered and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love being able to do my own gels!!</li>
            <li> THIS ISNT A TOP COAT PEOPLE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t this stuff talked about more?!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to grown nails since i hit 50; now I can again!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS POLISH!</li>
            <li> Increases the wear of the your favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget a really good top coat.</li>
            <li> I found a Pinterest about how to create your own gel nails..</li>
            <li> I applied the top coat again and I was good.</li>
            <li> One or two coats of good quality top coat</li>
            <li> they do look nice.</li>
            <li> but it gets kind of chunky and globby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that after removing this product, just do a nice oil or paraffin treatment just in case or apply so cuticle oil</li>
            <li> The truth is none of them is really effective.</li>
            <li> I will say the application process takes kind of a while</li>
            <li> And if drying is a problem , I use a quick coat and it works great afterwards...</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> BUT I don&#x27;t feel like my nails are super strong, nothing incredible.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, though, I am impressed so far and will continue to use it with my at home manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think that top coat doesn&#x27;t play nice with my China glaze polish because it shrunk the polish on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think my nails have ever looked better.  </li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is INM Out The Door.</li>
            <li> I use my own basecoat, then this Gelous Nail, then my color, then top it with another coat of the Gelous Nail</li>
            <li> Easy to take off too!</li>
            <li> I painted my nails a week ago and they are still going strong!</li>
            <li> No chips for two weeks, and still going strong!</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out, I saw this on pinterest and had to try the &amp;#34;at home gel nails&amp;#34; I also bought the suggested top coat (AMAZING top coat).  </li>
            <li> Well for about the first month Gelous was working GREAT.</li>
            <li> It works so well and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CAP THE EDGE OF YOUR NAILS WITH EACH AND EVERY LAYER OF POLISH.  </li>
            <li> it works fine and gives my nail quite a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I wear it as an overcoat UNDER my top coat (does that make sense?)</li>
            <li> Top with favorite top</li>
            <li> I have always been one to love painting my nails, but I can&#x27;t stand when it chips...</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> better than shellac at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Best if you use Seche Vite Top Coat it dries instantly and lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use mine as a top coat</li>
            <li> such an awesome alternative to getting gel nails at the salon.  </li>
            <li> coat of your fav top coat (I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> seche vite and julep top coats</li>
            <li> I love.</li>
            <li> Use a shiny top coat to maintain it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> The shine &amp; wear is phenomenal (picture below is 8 days &amp; counting ).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t discolor or shrink your polish, plus it keeps my rhinestones from falling off much better than Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> I truly recommend this brand to anyone that loves nail art &amp; anyone who likes wearing their polish for more than a week.</li>
            <li> Not as durable as a salon gel manicure,  but definitely more durable than anything else I have ever used at home.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps as many of the tips I&#x27;ve read in reviews of products has helped me.</li>
            <li> i really wanted this to be great...</li>
            <li> but its okay...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed for better results.</li>
            <li> I love using this as a topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I would layer gelous, nail polish, gelous, nail polish, then Selche as my top coat.</li>
            <li> Magically, though, the color does not transfer into the gelous.  </li>
            <li> Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do one coat Gelous, one coat nail color, one coat gelous, one coat nail color, top coat</li>
            <li> and I got so many compliment.  </li>
            <li> I will reorder better than nothing</li>
            <li> and I love them!I</li>
            <li> need more time to evaluate this product but it seems to be working to a degree.  </li>
            <li> Layer it as a Basecoat and a top coat for gel like nails</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle works great!</li>
            <li> I thought this was just OK.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I tried this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I think you would love it too.</li>
            <li> and then a top coat -</li>
            <li> This nail polish stays on for 2 or more weeks.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , however I do use my hands more than most people.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Love it use it</li>
            <li> I used it the way everybody is saying to use it, gelous, color, gelous, color, top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> but I still don&#x27;t get more than 7 days outof manicure...</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to get this to work for me.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Put a coat between each coat of color and on top.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Then, from what I read on Pinterest you are supposed to apply a top coat, but of</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This polish is okay.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a top coat for the shine.</li>
            <li> I still absolutely love this stuff and hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that is part of the reason it keeps the polish on</li>
            <li> The best part is it comes up with regular acetone and</li>
            <li> but that is much better than the severe damage salon gel polish was doing from the scraping process.</li>
            <li> I will try again with Essie polish and change my review if it lasts 7 days :)</li>
            <li> I suppose better nutrition has to be the answer.</li>
            <li> then 1 top</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with this product is that with some nail polishes the nail polishes will peel off in a day or two, even with using a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this over nail color, then use one layer of a shiny top coat over this.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> Make sure to coat the tips of the nail as well.</li>
            <li> then two coats of my color, another Gelous and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> as a nurse I wash my hands many times a day.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love it worth every penny!!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I use it as a top coat too because of how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Why spend more when you can get this easy to use product.</li>
            <li> and therefore they are able to grow and do not break as easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and can be used as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li> They are strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I added my favorite polish color to Gelous and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat not a base.  </li>
            <li> I would think it would work better with a UV light.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and works great.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply it directly to clean nails.</li>
            <li> Which is longer than most nail polishes last, but still is all the great when compared to shellac.</li>
            <li> I find my polish to be a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for a while afterward, making it easy to dent.  </li>
            <li> easy to remove</li>
            <li> Chips off too easily.</li>
            <li> I can use my nails for things and they stay strong with no chipping or ripping of the nail.  </li>
            <li> I have never wanted to give a rave review more than I do right now!</li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as this is used in between coats of polish and then on the top it work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Shimmery ones are best because it is less noticeable when it starts chipping or fading at the edges.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Clear top coat (quick drying is</li>
            <li> BUT for best results...I use the Gelous then any nail polish color/brand...then repeat (Gelous and colored nail polish) after they seem to be somewhat dried</li>
            <li> Great product made my polish last longer</li>
            <li> I liked that i could peel this off in a whole piece because once my nails start to chip I peel off my polish.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to make your polish last all week!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as an alternative to buying a UV light for gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> One coat of your choice of basecoat (my go-to is Revlon colorstay gel smooth nail</li>
            <li> no shrinkage and fantastic</li>
            <li> It feels tacky for about an 2 hours even after putting it in an LED light</li>
            <li> But after it hardens, my nails look fantastic and my polish lasts without chipping.  </li>
            <li> Easy clean up but did lose some of the polish.</li>
            <li> light gel coat  </li>
            <li> Light gel coat.  </li>
            <li> Light gel coat.  </li>
            <li> Best gel base coat love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVEEE this :) :)</li>
            <li> It was easy to peel off in full pieces.</li>
            <li> and Im sure it will do exactly as espected</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I love this basecoat, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for it!</li>
            <li> this stuff actually stays on my fingernails for many days - and nothing I have found has been able to do that!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one downfall: you have to be willing to sit around with the many polish coats drying for around an hour.</li>
            <li> I found that it is best to dry the color polish with a blow dryer for a while before applying the top coat so that the color is partially dry and doesn&#x27;t bleed through when the top coat is applied.</li>
            <li> Clean nails&lt;</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> : Yes, this stuff is great at resisting chips, but if it does happen to chip or get a deep scratch, it will probably end up peeling off a good bit of extra polish with it as opposed to just chipping right where the damage is.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited.</li>
            <li> :) And third, this may seem like an aint-nobody-got-time-for-that kind of thing, but for a week-long, chip-free manicure that I can do while watching a 30 minute episode of something on Netflix, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> I use a fast drying top coat (In a Hurry by Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> One coat of this, one coat of nail polish, another coat of this, one coat of nail polish, fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> However, it is nothing like a true salon gel nail manicure</li>
            <li> ( if your color is a one coater skip this step and go straight to your top coat)&lt;br</li>
            <li> i should have known there was no way that was true, but i was hopeful.</li>
            <li> it also seemed to really stick to my nails and make it so that pieces of the top layer of my nails peeled off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my absolute favorite for nail art.</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing for me, making my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a full bottle.</li>
            <li> As a homemaker and full time parent, I decided to put this product through the wringer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, it does work.</li>
            <li> I loved getting gel nails done at the salon on my regular length nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super hard on my nails and this stays on a full 3-7 days, which is awesome for me.</li>
            <li> others about the product and converted many new fans!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best stuff I have tried.</li>
            <li> I never painted my finger nails because the polish always chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this as a cheap substitute for salon gel manicures for those who like to dabble in doing their own nails.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> They also have very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> That fact that my nail color last that long really impressed me.</li>
            <li> Really does hold polish on!!</li>
            <li> I will totally be ordering more for myself, sisters and friends!</li>
            <li> The formula is thick like gel, easy to work with &amp; completely levels out creating the perfect finish for your nail designs.</li>
            <li> Works amazing when latered with regular nail polish!!!!</li>
            <li> its just like a gel manicure except without the UV light which can be very harmful.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and they still look freshly painted.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this my nails look like its been professionally done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do more than a clear coat...</li>
            <li> On natural nails it can be used as top and bottom coat.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So nice to have a product actually WORK!</li>
            <li> Well worth the $6.</li>
            <li> This is truly great for a lasting manicure at home which looks professional.  </li>
            <li> but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> But with this product my first manicure lasted a full seven days</li>
            <li> Then use a quick dry shiny top coat!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I will most definitely keep this in product handy for those special occasions such as vacations, holidays and so on.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the purchase as it is very easy to apply and not at all expensive when compared to getting a gel color at a nail spa.</li>
            <li> and it came right off.</li>
            <li> My nail polish came right off hours after it was put on</li>
            <li> I even do my nails right before bed.</li>
            <li> as it makes my nails feel, I am equally if not more so impressed by its performance as a clear coat.</li>
            <li> (side note, I usually find supplements (like viviscal) more effective than nail polish treatments)</li>
            <li> Used many layers of this polish with a quick dry top coat &amp; normal colored polish, and it literally stayed on 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told</li>
            <li> Also, if you have a dark nail polish, the layers can be cumbersome time wise.  </li>
            <li> they get a certain length and then just break!  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 8/27/15  I used this with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat and my manicure is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> pros: when done correctly, this is a phenomenal substitute for a professional gel mani (or really any mani).</li>
            <li> There are claims of it making a manicure last up to 12 days with chip free, peel free results.</li>
            <li> but I like to make sure my nails stay as nice as possible for as long as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) I attached pictures from last Sunday, right before I took my nail polish off and re-did them.</li>
            <li> i very much recommend this gel coat.</li>
            <li> My wife and Daughters really like this product!</li>
            <li> i love how my nails look when i go to get gel manicures at salons, but i was starting to worry that i was stripping my nails each time i would take the stuff</li>
            <li> I always end up with perfect nails and usually take my polish off simply because I want a color change rather than because it&#x27;s chipping.</li>
            <li> First coat of color/polish</li>
            <li> Top coat dries instantly and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Makes my nails really pretty and shiny</li>
            <li> I always chip polish (first day) and</li>
            <li> I had to soak the bottle in some polish remover to be able to open.  </li>
            <li> I need to do more testing with different brand combinations.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more from this seller...</li>
            <li> and i really like it!</li>
            <li> Then I put the nails under a uv light  for 4 to 8 minutes to finish  them for a truly professional job.</li>
            <li> I find that after a week or so that a light buffing with a soft cloth renews the shine.</li>
            <li> First try:</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my nail polish last over a week.</li>
            <li> My fingernail BROKE for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should invest in rubber gloves too ;).  </li>
            <li> No matter how many coats of this I put on, my nails still cracked the next day.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re such a Budapest, then gelous, and sally hasen intra-dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I had no cracking, chipping, or peeling till exactly on day seven.</li>
            <li> Put a layer of this in between each layer of color and then put this on top of the final coat of color.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t try hide my nails when pointing to something or doing something with my hands.</li>
            <li> First time I applied this polish, my manicure lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well to lengthen the life of a manicure.  </li>
            <li> : lasts longer than regular polish, it&#x27;s easier to apply (it&#x27;s all more forgiving, compared to Gels) and easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: I&#x27;d recommend using a cuticle softener and being sure to push back your cuticles.</li>
            <li> However the first time I bathe, it begins to peel.</li>
            <li> I definitely allow more drying time and I finish with drying drops or drying spray.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, thank you so much, a friend gave me some of this</li>
            <li> so this is about as fast right</li>
            <li> Sure, by that point my cuticles are a mess, but the Gelous keeps the polish I put on securely in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Essie Gel Setter top coat is the only one that really works for me, so that&#x27;s what I use now.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is good, not doubt, but you&#x27;re only gonna get an extra day or two of wear with it.</li>
            <li> I got it at Sally&#x27;s, along with Seche Vite top coat which I&#x27;ve been wanting to try for a long time.</li>
            <li> I should mention that the fairly cheap Wet n Wild polish I used held up better than my China Glaze.</li>
            <li> Works really well to thicken the nail and, when used as a layering between coats of color, really gives the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect!</li>
            <li> far my nail polish has lasted around 5 full days with no chips.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using more then one coat, I actually used 3.&lt;br /&gt;First used a nail strengthener, coat of gelous nail, nail color, gelous nail, nail color, clear top coat and a last coat of gelous.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend this product to anyone that paints their nails on a regular basis and does not want to ruin their nails or change the color more that once a week or pay for the pros to do it.</li>
            <li> It made my manicures last 4-5 days, which is AWESOME for me because previously my nails would chip the first or second day.</li>
            <li> It also is easily removed with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Can be removed easily using standard nail polish remover</li>
            <li> I also have a problem with my nails cracking and peeling when they get a certain length.</li>
            <li> I use a nail dehydrator, then a coat of Gelous, two coats of colored polish, another coat of Gelous, and then Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Gelous, Color, Gelous, Color, Fast dry top coat.    </li>
            <li> It removes just fine with regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> For the price this stuff is actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, it makes doing your nails so much easier!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this lasts long!!! :)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, haven&#x27;t had enough time to really test it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the wide brush, so much easier to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> I really hope this stuff does what it promises.</li>
            <li> When I stopped making weekly trips to the salon my nails really suffered.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, I no longer have either one of these problems.</li>
            <li> I used this with Sinful Colors &amp;#34;Cinderella&amp;#34; which is a light blue glittered polish.</li>
            <li> I really want to try this with OPI Neon nail polishes because those chip on my nails within a day.</li>
            <li> Also my nails grew so much and are so much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> IT DRIES FAST AND GLASS</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an intense  color but stays on for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very protective and it lasts for awhile</li>
            <li> As much as she does her nails</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It lasted about three days vefore the tips of my nails started chipping, without doing much of anything except maybe washing my hands.  </li>
            <li> and i wanted to try this so that i could save money and also not damage my nails as much.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice that this product keeps my nail polish on longer.</li>
            <li> Yes, I danced a happy dance for a broken nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it dries incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for a manicure that lasts 3-6 days.  </li>
            <li> So much for Gel nails.</li>
            <li> Its so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> you really have to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really compare to a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> This stuff also makes my fingernails and toenails much stronger</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really wimpy nails.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And on top of everything, I was never really a fan of having to stick my hands into a UV &amp;#34;nail oven&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll start to harden up much quicker.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep polish longer.</li>
            <li> With this process i get about 7-8 days out of my polish and they really are not chipped on the ends</li>
            <li> Takes ~5-6 days to start chipping (when worn on its own)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 medium coats are enough to get your nails smooth &amp; shiny&lt;</li>
            <li> Reasonable dent-resistance while drying&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polish lasts much longer with Gelous application.</li>
            <li> Really does help nail polish stay on longer ...</li>
            <li> Only challenge is figuring out which polishes won&#x27;t bubble up when used in conjunction with it; so far the winners are OPI and most Loreal and Sally Hanson polishes.</li>
            <li> one thing that DID make my nails long and strong were gel manicures</li>
            <li> well this did help my nails grow strong and long when i wore it alone.</li>
            <li> Pretty good last longer than normal but not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and will dry relatively fast, but I did not feel it made my nails</li>
            <li> I was so excited and thought I had finally found my go-to!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I also ended up buying this quick dry top coat from American Classic as well</li>
            <li> But compared with the time I would&#x27;ve spent at the salon, driving there and back, and paying a whole lot more, I think it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> Just make sure you let each coat dry completely before adding another.</li>
            <li> so a lot of product gets wasted and makes cleaning less than ideal</li>
            <li> and I can work my full 12 hour shift at a hospital constantly washing my hands with out getting an embarrassing chip during the day.</li>
            <li> nail polish helps my nail color last so much longer than it would by just applying two coats of regular polish and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this product along with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat and following very specific application instructions, I was able to get my nail color to last exactly seven days before it even started chipping off.</li>
            <li> Multiple blogs and social media sites rave about how wonderful this product due to how long it extense a nail color manicure.</li>
            <li> Good get base; I have to say it doesn&#x27;t cling to my nails as long as I was hoping, but better than many</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly with minimal chemical smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway this stuff is an OK alternative to an actual gel manicure but definitely doesn&#x27;t replace it in longevity.  </li>
            <li> Now looks fabulous, lasting one week so far.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had was it peeded off quickly</li>
            <li> So shiny and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Seriously - no chipping, no peeling - up to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I read up how this product can make your regular nail polish last longer, and have more of that &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect without having to use the gel/shellac polishes.</li>
            <li> but I have definitely noticed that it seems to work much better with sheer colors.</li>
            <li> I do one coat gelous, one coat regular nail polish, one coat gelous, 2nd coat regular nail polish, another coat gelous, finish with a quick drying high-end top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quick dryn( Seche Vite), and even a commercial dryer.</li>
            <li> I use 3-4 coats of this first, then a few coats of any nail polish, and clear coat on top</li>
            <li> and it is a good alternative to shellac, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so my hopes are quite high.</li>
            <li> It would have been a little more helpful to have instructions.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to prevent early chipping of nail polish.</li>
            <li> a normal manicure lasts for like a day if i&#x27;m cautious).</li>
            <li> (Normally I get two days tops.)</li>
            <li> most likely you&#x27;re using the wrong kind of nail polish.</li>
            <li> With putting this many coats of polish on, your polish is very thick and it&#x27;s super noticable at the cuticles when it grows out</li>
            <li> This get coat helps any nail color stay chip free for longer than any other top/base coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it does make my polish chip free for a day or two extra but definitely not like a week longer or anything.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry quickly</li>
            <li> Also, if you have short nails like mine, make sure you drag each coat of this over the tips of your nails (basically painting a little on your fingertip skin, which you can then easily remove with acetone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it with a color coat because I normally prefer the natural look.</li>
            <li> It leaves my polish looking fresh for almost a week, and that is a long time for me.</li>
            <li> So I bought this probably about two months ago, and have been using Selche Vita, (not sure on the spelling) as a top coat.</li>
            <li> My first bottle is almost done and my mom&#x27;s only used it once.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tested to see how many days past 7 it will go.</li>
            <li> It keeps my natural nails looking manicured for over a week!  </li>
            <li> I can only give 4 stars, because I just used it for the first time today, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells a little strong but whatever, it&#x27;s nailpolish</li>
            <li> But I recently saw this product on Pinterest, and decided to give it a shot because it was decently priced (cheaper if you buy straight from Sally&#x27;s Beauty).</li>
            <li> it off with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat  to dry your &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; instantly and keep it shiny</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t let it dry fast enough or is it because I use cheap color polish that it flakes off instead of actually chips.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions below carefully for that perfect gel like manicure ... DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID OF THE COATS</li>
            <li> She applied one clear coat then one polish color, then one coat gellous, another coat polish, and another coat gellous.</li>
            <li> My manicure has lasted for 10 days so far with no chips.  </li>
            <li> through 2 bottles so far</li>
            <li> This product has been able to keep my nail color in tact for at least a week if not longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had manicures last a whole week, which is unheard of with how often I was my hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like Gel UV, except to harsh light</li>
            <li> I opted with checking with a professional at a nail salon to see if it needed primer etc.  </li>
            <li> My manicure is now a week old and loss like I got it done a day ago</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and was pleased, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> The old saying goes, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t believe everything you read on the internet&amp;#34; is the reason why I tried this product out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper than actually going to the salon</li>
            <li> As Nails, Nailtiques, professional manicures, eating jello, vitamins...</li>
            <li> It helps my nail polish last longer and stay much shinier.</li>
            <li> Never really dried on the nails.  </li>
            <li> You have to complete the manicure as directed by applying a coat of this then a coat of your nail polish and repeat by layering.</li>
            <li> This base coat is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used Gelous base coat as a top coat on the regular polish that&#x27;s put on acrylic nails for a while now and have had good results.</li>
            <li> Not the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used though.</li>
            <li> If you want a DIY gel manicure, this base coat is great for that!</li>
            <li> No different than any other basic top coat.</li>
            <li> Even if they don&#x27;t chip right away, they look dull and lose their shine right away.</li>
            <li> major con and minus one star is that this stuff starts to congeal and thicken in the bottle pretty quickly, especially if you keep it in a hot place</li>
            <li> Take alcohol or vinegar to your nails first then apply when dry.</li>
            <li> Depending on how many coats you apply, it also seriously thickens the nail.</li>
            <li> I have been doing the same exact routine and using the same polish that I had been using</li>
            <li> I get manicures maybe once every 4-5 months but try to paint my nails at home regularly (trying to break that nail-biting habit, per usual), and this has made my at-home attempts a million times more legit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my polish on a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> but now they are so healthy and LONG after going through a few bottles of this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent most of my life picking and biting at them, and then been ashamed of the mess I have on my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am pretty rough on my nails; lots of dishes, cleaning, yard work...</li>
            <li> it has wide brush and very convenient!</li>
            <li> This product has done everything that other products have promised, but for less (in most cases).</li>
            <li> I put sally hansen hard as nails - wraps on top of it for extra protection</li>
            <li> fast dry.</li>
            <li> that last pretty long.</li>
            <li> This product helps my DIY manicures last much longer than just painting my nails with polish only.  </li>
            <li> I was told to put on two coats of the Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat, then put on a coat of your favorite nail polish, another coat of the Gelous Nail Gel and then a Top Coat.  </li>
            <li> The brush is thick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with different top coats, with no top coat, with different polish brands.</li>
            <li> The only time it hasn&#x27;t completely ruined my mani as it dries is if I use it just as a clear coat over bare nails.</li>
            <li> worry about the layers, if you use Seche Vite it dries hard in seconds and super shine!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails.</li>
            <li> The process is a little time consuming, but well worth</li>
            <li> read in other reviews that this product may dry out the nails, on my first try I did not see that at all, my nails werehealthy and normal.  </li>
            <li> The only plus was that it made my nails super shiny, but other than that it was just like using a regular topcoat.</li>
            <li> For reference, before when I just used seche clear and vite, my polish would last two to three days.</li>
            <li> just a regular clear coat</li>
            <li> While this still isnt as long as real gel, it is a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something under $40 to give me a lasting clear shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far</li>
            <li> but mine didn&#x27;t last anywhere near the promised time.  </li>
            <li> Even then my polish can sometimes get prints/indentations in it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> My nails look professionally done and last for days if well cared for.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and normally can only go a day before my nails start chipping.</li>
            <li> Apply thin coat of favorite color.</li>
            <li> within two days it would chip with most colors... and after a few wks of using it it got really gooey and thick in the bottle and would leave air bubbles when i would apply it...</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> This made my manicure last a full week but after continued use, my nails really dried out and started peeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a professional expensive gel manicure, but it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li> One more thin coat of Nail Polish (and nail art, if you&#x27;re into it)&lt;br /&gt;J.</li>
            <li> Applied a thin layer of Northern Lights Hologram Top Coat for a sparkly affect (OPTIONAL)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail polish person because it always looks chipped and thin, but this keeps me on top of maintaining my nails.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear, not tacky at all and dries quickly giving yoi rock hard nails that don&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> AMAZING)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, 7 coats of polish but it dries just as fast to the touch as any other manicure.</li>
            <li> but with other colors it didnt really prevent my polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> This base coat is so good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as tough as gel nail polish but very much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li> The very tip end of the nails wore down very slightly but it just made the manicure look better with a smoothed down tip.</li>
            <li> That might sound like a bad thing, but it means that it was finally strong enough to not tear, but break.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish far as I can tell...</li>
            <li> Serving as an important part in growing out my natural nails after leaving the world of acrylics behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and have never made it more than a few days without having to re-do my nails.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more frustrating than doing your nails and having them chip the next day.</li>
            <li> This method requires so many coats that it simply does not work with thick polish (thick from being old or just thick like many china glaze polishes or say, an Essie ballet slippers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying for a second time and this time I filed my nail surface a bit and wiped down with rubbing alcohol hoping to get a better bond, not sure if that was the issue....  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am following the instructions properly, but I do a base coat, let it dry, do my color, let it dry, do a top coat of clear shiny polish and the top it off with the gel again.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and makes your nails hard as rocks.</li>
            <li> Typically my manicures are chip free for about 2 days and unwearable by day 5 (with base coat, 2 coats of high end polish plus top coat, seche or out the door).</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It helps the manicure last longer,  but certainly not as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but using this base coat under my polish and then the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce on top made my nails look like I have a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to let each layer dry completely, or the color comes onto the brush.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails and have tried many remedies.</li>
            <li> This gel really helps keep my clear polish in tact for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to go to the nail salon and paying $25 just get a gel manicure and most of time it would be the same color because they never really had a big variety of colors to chose from like the regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> So far the base coat works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I always see shilling for Seche Vite and other top coats, which I&#x27;ve tired.</li>
            <li> I usually used to get gel nails at the nail spa and it does give almost the same effect and much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> It seems easier to get it done, because it took over an hour for all drying to happen, and then the clean up was a bit frustrating (I ended up trimming it from the cuticles, rather than put Acetone on it).</li>
            <li> My polish seems to have lasted a few days longer than usual and it looks even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It works as promised and keeps a manicure for at least a week - possibly more, but I usually re-do my nails every Sunday night for the week</li>
            <li> I actually put this on at home after a salon manicure and it makes it last twice as long.</li>
            <li> -The drying time is average for a clear coat.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really give it a lot of drying time in between coats, I usually allow for a longer drying period at the end of painting them to prevent denting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought just about every long lasting product there is.</li>
            <li> this has made my manicure last a really long time.</li>
            <li> this stuff is supposed to make your nail polish last as long as gel nail polish does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in place of investing in gel nails and my manicures last just as long.</li>
            <li> Gelous nail does not, like others have said would, last long.</li>
            <li> I used this with a Sinful shine color, which is supposed to be a long lasting color to begin with.</li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t last as long as a gel nail manicure, but it&#x27;s not that, so there.</li>
            <li> so I can review how long the color actually</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Lasts a long time (even w/o regular use); my bottle has lasted over a year w/o drying out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Also make sure you seal the edge of your nails with this base coat, it will really make it last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty thick</li>
            <li> I picked up this little gem at my local Sally&#x27;s after having seen a few how to do light less gel manicures at home on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then stuck me under regular heat lamp to dry.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing out rough polishes or as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> not a fan - just use a regular base coat and good polish</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my nails are growing, they are harder, they don&#x27;t peel and I&#x27;m not pestered by little rough spots that lend to picking or biting.</li>
            <li> Painted my own natural nails and although there were slight dings and chips, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite mastered a blend or routine like some people seem to have done, but this polish keeps even dark colors chip free for at least five days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removing this mani was no different than removing any other nail polish, just used regular acetone with glycerin in it to moisturize my nails.  </li>
            <li> I am not great with doing my nails, but wanted to enjoy my nail polish a little bit longer than, say, 10 minutes when I use traditional polish.</li>
            <li> Stay at home mom who washes dishes and stuff all day long</li>
            <li> color has lasted as long as 1.5 - 2 weeks with this method and my nails continue to grow and look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long it lasts because I remove it every three days or so to shape my nails and oil my cuticles, but I believe those that say it sticks around for a week plus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I will like it long term.  </li>
            <li> My nails looked salon-quality after they were done, however the manicure did not last as long as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I skip the normal top coat and just use the Gelous base</li>
            <li> and I needed a really good base coat.</li>
            <li> This might have been good, if, as the Sally&#x27;s clerk told me, and the name implies, it was a gel base coat, or had anything to do with gel nails.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other topcoats (namely Seche Vite)&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes prone to bubbles</li>
            <li> I probably could have gone more than 7 days, but I painted my nails for Halloween and peeled off the color when I got bored with it!</li>
            <li> Comes with a wide flat brush which makes getting it on a bit quicker.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help nail polish to last any longer than any other base/top coat.</li>
            <li> Why did it take so long for me to find this?!</li>
            <li> This polish chips after a day, just like any other regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Not as tough as real gel nails, but also no UV lights or acetone soak is necessary.</li>
            <li> My nail polish lasts a week with absolute minimal wear, and I&#x27;m hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> I am a classy lady who isn&#x27;t afraid to get down and dirty, but I sure as hell hope I still have a kickass manicure once I clean that dirt off of my hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff bubbles and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I have waited over 1.5 hours for this to dry and it will still end up smudging.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get it to dry.</li>
            <li> one coat of ACG one coat of color one coat of ACG one coat of color one coat of seche vite allowed about 1-2 minutes to dry between coats  </li>
            <li> This does dry the fastest of the three.</li>
            <li> (Allowing time for each coat to dry in between coats)</li>
            <li> I just recommend using seche Vite as your topcoat; any non-fast drying topcoat will not work well, takes forever to dry and ends with smudging.</li>
            <li> and I found that it helps the gel dry faster.</li>
            <li> Applied a second layer of the Coca Cola Red and let it dry for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Usually my nails start chipping within 1 or 2 days after applying polish and I&#x27;ve had polish on with this for over a week now with only barely noticeable chips at the tips of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush is too big and the polish is too thick to easily apply a thin coat without it being streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails hard, but it&#x27;s not a thick gel-type consistency.</li>
            <li> As it dries, it becomes very hard to clean up without making the bottom edges look uneven.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this polish to anyone who is as obsessed with nail products as I am or to anyone who wants the gel nail look without having to get an actual gel manicure done.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes a manicure last longer than usual.</li>
            <li> That is including me doing the regular stuff that usually tears my nail polish to shreds after just one day (like washing my hands regularly, doing the dishes, bathing, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To get the longest lasting manicure, I usually apply it in the following order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> super expensive)...</li>
            <li> but, once again, SUPER expensive....</li>
            <li> The only negative I have found with this after a couple months is it slightly yellows my natural nail</li>
            <li> It made my polish look gelish and gave that wet look</li>
            <li> Be careful or it will smudge...</li>
            <li> You must carefully wrap your nails or you&#x27;ll still get tipwear.  </li>
            <li> I have two things to add though, the polish does tend to peel off in big chunks after a few days, so I purchased Oraly Bonder tonight</li>
            <li> Helps my manicure last a few days longer</li>
            <li> It chipped after only a few days.</li>
            <li> It not really like a gel for the nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t see myself using this product on my regular few times a week manicures as it is a time consuming procedure</li>
            <li> I still apply my regular nail polish on top of this gel base.</li>
            <li> : First, the key seems to be to apply thin coats... not so thin that they&#x27;re spotty, but not thick and or &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; - or else all of the layers will get too thick and will take FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> and it is the final step before the top coat, and your coats are too thick and look like they&#x27;ll take ages to dry, fill a shallow bowl with cold water and dip your nail tips in and out for about ten seconds at a time for a couple of minutes...</li>
            <li> I have honestly not noticed a major difference if my polish laster longer or not.</li>
            <li> I will always use this now and am amazed that the price is so affordable in comparison to some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I do change my polish every other day.</li>
            <li> I am always cleaning so my manicures chip, this one lasted 4 days with no chips even when I was cleaning and doing other household chores.</li>
            <li> When i get anxious i peel off my nail polish and when i have this gel on it peels off the entire polish without having to struggle.</li>
            <li> Usually my nail polish only stays on for a day or two before a have to replace it.</li>
            <li> suggest: one thin coat gelous on nail, one thin coat polish, one thin coat gelous, one thin coat polish, one thin coat gelous, one thin coat top coat (i use seche vite fast dry top coat)</li>
            <li> gives thicker glossier look what i was looking for ... took a little while longer to dry would purchase again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good gel base coat nail polish</li>
            <li> This trick is to paint the color when the base is still wet, so it will adhere to it better.</li>
            <li> applied three thin coats already, dried fast</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat then use my regular polish &amp; then a layer of quick dry.</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down, this stuff truly makes my manicure last days longer than it usually did before.</li>
            <li> My polish did last longer than usual, with much less chipping.</li>
            <li> I also find that one additional coat of gelous is required before the top coat for very thin polishes (like Essie turks and caicos which is really thin).   </li>
            <li> It definitely protects the nail and doesn&#x27;t dull out the color.</li>
            <li> This stuff, on the other hand, makes my polish last for at least a week and a half with NO CHIPS.</li>
            <li> this stuff lets me go about 5 days without changing on average as opposed to 3 days)</li>
            <li> To say the least, it has been lasting around 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> This makes my manicures last for at least 2 weeks, and longer if I reapply.</li>
            <li> However over the past few weeks, my nails have been chipping on the second day.</li>
            <li> With this &amp;#34;gel like&amp;#34; polsih, my DIY mani can last AT LEAST 5 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I had the same issue with the gel polish at the nail salon (the stuff that is supposed to stay on for at least 10 days)</li>
            <li> Apply favorite base coat/hardener.</li>
            <li> (I also did a layer of this as a base coat then between each layer of color and top coat.)</li>
            <li> I have tried ORLY&#x27;s line of base coats, top coats, etc.</li>
            <li> I did a base coat of this, the color, this, the color, this, and a top coat of Seche Vite</li>
            <li> I used it as a base coat and then top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it between layers of polish, just as a base coat, just as a top coat, and as both base and top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a base coat and as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.</li>
            <li> I used this as my base coat AND my top coat and my nails are invincible.</li>
            <li> I have been doing two coats of the Gelous Base, than a coat of polish, another coat of Gelous, another coat of polish, and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> LOVE this as a base and a topcoat.</li>
            <li> Really, really love this base coat.</li>
            <li> I use gelous as a base coat and then ONE coat of nail polish and finish it off with a top coat of gelous.</li>
            <li> Applied a thin layer of any color of choice, I did OPI Coca Cola Red, let it dry for a minute or so  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my trial and error run down:  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it last any longer than it would without this base coat, even when following specific DIYs for longest lasting polish.</li>
            <li> and I only have 2 very small chips.</li>
            <li> Want a gel manicure like the ones at the salons, but half the cost?&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> I have always had nail polish peel off within less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> , I have a nervous habit of rubbing my nails when ive got polish on and literally by the end of the day ive rubbed half of it off.  </li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin when i use the gelous nail my nails are harder and alittle less likely to break</li>
            <li> Not only did it fail to make my manicure last longer than 3 maybe 4 days before chipping, it ruined my nails.  </li>
            <li> When I received the product, the bottle was slightly opened and had leaked out all over the bottle and the inside of the package.</li>
            <li> nail polish chips less often with this polish than without</li>
            <li> You can get this from sallybeauty.com for about half the price.</li>
            <li> I am too angry to review it as such; will try to get my money back for the misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Slightly strengthens nails (leaves a matte coating that adheres to the nail after removed with nail polish remover)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not dry as fast as other base coat</li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin and usually tear straight off if they grow past my fingertip.</li>
            <li> With this stuff I can (usually) go up to 4 days with minimal chipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also just apply this base coat, apply your polish color as usual, then top with this gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the probem I had were little smudges.</li>
            <li> Allow a few minutes between each coat.</li>
            <li> The key is to do THIN layers of everything...</li>
            <li> but then it loses it&#x27;s wet look.</li>
            <li> I use one coat and change it every few days.</li>
            <li> This stuff dried my nails out and now they are peeling.</li>
            <li> search for gel manicure on Pinterest and follow the instructions - multiple thin layers.</li>
            <li> The polish lasted a few days before chipping.</li>
            <li> No light needed.</li>
            <li> few tips</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this product or waste my money.</li>
            <li> Lastly I applied a thin layer of the Gelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last longer and dries much faster when I use this base.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase of the Gelous Base Coat - I will always keep it on hand and will never use another base coat again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that they would chip, but no matter what I used if my hands got wet</li>
            <li> Has cut my manicure time by half!</li>
            <li> Gel look for pennies,less than half the time and no UV!</li>
            <li> Have to apply this base coat to clean nails.</li>
            <li> I use rubbing alcohol to clean my nails before the base coat.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> lasts for at least a week, if not more with minimal chips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person where my polish usually chips within a day and is horrible after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easy on my nails either.</li>
            <li> I am on my 7th day of my manicure typing this with minimal chips and hard nails!</li>
            <li> but you have to be patient and let each layer of polish fully dry and apply thin coats.</li>
            <li> Applied a thin layer of Gelous and allowed it to dry for</li>
            <li> Applied a thin layer of Gelous and allowed it to dry for a minute or so</li>
            <li> One more thin coat of Gelous Nail Base Coat&lt;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find using it as a base coat instead of a top coat decreased chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all of the hype is about this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Im not sure how to prevent that</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite base coat!</li>
            <li> I love Gelous Base Coat!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really sure what has changed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Looks like a couple people have mentioned it here, but to reiterate, I do six steps: thin coat of this, thin coat of color, another thin coat of this, another thin coat of color, another thin coat of this, top coat.</li>
            <li> Used this on splitting nails a few times and WA-LA, they don&#x27;t split anymore!</li>
            <li> I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> My polish usually chips within a day or two</li>
            <li> this usually lasts me about 2-3 weeks on my finger nails (and i work with my hands a lot doing things.</li>
            <li> if not better for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> usual routine is this:&lt;br /&gt;Base</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle, shipping was as usual</li>
            <li> I usually change my polish every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed and annoyed that I wasted money on it</li>
            <li> I do gelous as a base, one coat color, second coat gelous, second coat color, seche Vite.</li>
            <li> After 2 hours of curing and reapplying, I finally looked it up, and found it is a traditional nail base coat.  </li>
            <li> This base coat also dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I already used half the bottle in hopes that it might start helping my weak nails grow by protecting them for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I used the Orly bonder base coat first, then the gelous, the Opi</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a regular base coat that lasts this long</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed because I expected the color to last at least a week before it started to chip.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, you need to put a base coat on before using it, otherwise, it could dry out your nails.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hard on your nails or wash your hands a lot you will still have chipping.</li>
            <li> and I am hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> My nails hardly ever break.</li>
            <li> so I tried really hard to figure something</li>
            <li> Hard</li>
            <li> It works well and brings out the color and doesn&#x27;t dull it what so ever.</li>
            <li> Dries hard</li>
            <li> have used this for EVERY manicure since I have purchased, and my manicure lasts at least five days, without chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, IT DRIES SLOW.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too thick</li>
            <li> but I do not like how thick it is.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it was not so globby and thick.</li>
            <li> This gives a thick, fully sealed layer of protection to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it is a stand out product!</li>
            <li> not sure if it will help keep polish on!</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I wish i found this before I got my Orly Rubberized bonder...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong, but my polish peels right off my nails after using this base coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s gel coat for a base and top coat and was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> it will never dry / bubble up and smear / other horrible things.</li>
            <li> When you apply your color over this, don&#x27;t be afraid to put a lot on, as this Gel Base coat just soaks your color right up.</li>
            <li> and I am very hard on my nails,  </li>
            <li> I use hard as wraps as a base coat, then color, gelous, color, gelous, and a speed dry topcoat.</li>
            <li> im tough on my nails</li>
            <li> Apply another thin coat of color.</li>
            <li> Even when your nail polish starts to chip this base coat will allow you to peal the entire sheet of polish off the nail in one strip!</li>
            <li> My polish will easily last a week with this base coat.</li>
            <li> ( if it&#x27;s cheaper polish that tends to bubble use a thin layer ...</li>
            <li> Trick is to apply thin coats and allow some drying time in between.</li>
            <li> The packaging was poor quality which allowed the bottle to spill and had caked the lid shut w excess polish.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to using another base coat again.</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t thin, and they grow - but polish just wouldn&#x27;t stick to them.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of this base, but it is indeed the only one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Now my nails are finally starting to grow out with the help of this base coat.</li>
            <li> One thin coat of Nail Strengthener (I use OPI Nail Envy</li>
            <li> /&gt;E. One thin coat of Nail Polish</li>
            <li> but I really hated the soaking and the scraping that had to be done and the damage it was doing to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I use the Gelous by starting with two coats as a base.</li>
            <li> THIN THIN THIN is the operative word or</li>
            <li> Keep the coats thin, and don&#x27;t allow too much dry time in between, the base needs something to set on.  </li>
            <li> apply this polish as my base coat and let it dry for about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With this polish, if I gently rough my nail and use it as a base and between each layer of polish (covering the edge of the nail with each Gelous coat) the polish stays until I remove it.  </li>
            <li> i use a base coat, followed by this, and while it is still slightly wet, apply the nail color.</li>
            <li> I usual don&#x27;t use polish on my nails because a few hours after doing them they chip and look horrible!</li>
            <li> And it works well with both expensive and in-expensive nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I am usually unable to keep polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> ran around like a maniac at work,  worked out,  my nails have not once broken!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I went home and re-did my nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for my wedding as an alternative to an expensive manicure.</li>
            <li> ..guess I don&#x27;t know tge secret!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Consider me addicted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry 2.</li>
            <li> Sadly, nothing I can find compares to a salon gel or shellac manicure.</li>
            <li> The instructions i have read say to use a very thin coat between layers</li>

            <li> expensive gel nails that weakened my nails to begin with!  </li>
            <li> I hate the look of chipped nails, so this drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> but since I started using this product, I already broke two nails :(&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My manicure has lasted for 10 days so far with no chips.  The ends are wearing off but I do ALOT of typing!  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> For the price this stuff is actually pretty decent. I wear it as an overcoat UNDER my top coat (does that make sense?) and it does make my polish chip free for a day or two extra but definitely not like a week longer or anything. The instructions i have read say to use a very thin coat between layers and i did try that and my nail polish and it just did not work for me. the brush is too big and the polish is too thick to easily apply a thin coat without it being streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this stuff is an OK alternative to an actual gel manicure but definitely doesn&#x27;t replace it in longevity.  (side note: i replace my nail polish as soon as it starts chipping so this stuff lets me go about 5 days without changing on average as opposed to 3 days)</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff. My nails usually reject color after a few days, but this gel clear coat gives me 7 full days of shiny, lasting color. I probably could have gone more than 7 days, but I painted my nails for Halloween and peeled off the color when I got bored with it! My tips for lasting color (lots of steps, I know...but it works!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply favorite base coat/hardener. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply 1 coat Gelous. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply thin coat of favorite color. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply coat of Gelous. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply another thin coat of color. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply coat of Gelous. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;7. Top with favorite top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty rough on my nails; lots of dishes, cleaning, yard work... I really hope this stuff does what it promises. I am a classy lady who isn&#x27;t afraid to get down and dirty, but I sure as hell hope I still have a kickass manicure once I clean that dirt off of my hands. As mentioned, though, I am impressed so far and will continue to use it with my at home manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, you can&#x27;t beat the price. A 7 day gel manicure at the salon would cost easily $20, so $8 on a bottle of this magnificent miracle worker is a bargain if you ask me.</li>
            <li> My wife and Daughters really like this product! They use it often.</li>
            <li> Want a gel manicure like the ones at the salons, but half the cost?&lt;br /&gt;Want your nail polish to last 2+ weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;Been through 2 bottles so far and I swear by it.  I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top it off with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat  to dry your &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; instantly and keep it shiny longer!&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00150LT40/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35)</li>
            <li> I have always been one to love painting my nails, but I can&#x27;t stand when it chips... But I recently saw this product on Pinterest, and decided to give it a shot because it was decently priced (cheaper if you buy straight from Sally&#x27;s Beauty). To say the least, it has been lasting around 2 weeks...it might have actually lasted longer but I like changing colors.... BUT for best results...I use the Gelous then any nail polish color/brand...then repeat (Gelous and colored nail polish) after they seem to be somewhat dried I use a fast drying top coat (In a Hurry by Sally&#x27;s). Since I don&#x27;t really give it a lot of drying time in between coats, I usually allow for a longer drying period at the end of painting them to prevent denting. Hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> Best gel base coat love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You need to use 5 or 6 coats to get a &amp;#34;gel-like&amp;#34; manicure with this stuff. Then it peels off 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Finally a way to get my manicures to last longer than 2 days without chipping. 5 days! And it works well with both expensive and in-expensive nail polishes. One coat of this, one coat of nail polish, another coat of this, one coat of nail polish, fast drying top coat and you&#x27;re set. Allow a few minutes between each coat.</li>
            <li> This makes my polish last longer which is a plus, but I wouldn&#x27;t replace my gel polish with it for manicures. If you&#x27;re hard on your nails or wash your hands a lot you will still have chipping. I got about 4-5 days out of my mani with Miracle Gel. (I also did a layer of this as a base coat then between each layer of color and top coat.)</li>
            <li> When I stopped making weekly trips to the salon my nails really suffered. This product has been able to keep my nail color in tact for at least a week if not longer. I do not want to have to repaint my nails between our regular Thursday night girls night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this is used in between coats of polish and then on the top it work great.</li>
            <li> Nail hardener and shiny coat - perfect for me trying to grow my nails!</li>
            <li> This stuff bubbles and takes forever to dry. I have waited over 1.5 hours for this to dry and it will still end up smudging.</li>
            <li> it has wide brush and very convenient!</li>
            <li> It works! I am usually unable to keep polish on my nails. I also have a problem with my nails cracking and peeling when they get a certain length. Thanks to this product, I no longer have either one of these problems. I recommend going to Pinterest and looking at pins on how to use it. This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Seriously the best stuff I have tried. I usual don&#x27;t use polish on my nails because a few hours after doing them they chip and look horrible! I tried this and have had them painted for a week now with NO chips. I would recommend using more then one coat, I actually used 3.&lt;br /&gt;First used a nail strengthener, coat of gelous nail, nail color, gelous nail, nail color, clear top coat and a last coat of gelous.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy about 3 every 2 months because I use it so often. Even when your nail polish starts to chip this base coat will allow you to peal the entire sheet of polish off the nail in one strip! (usually.. which is very convenient!) However, it is nothing like a true salon gel nail manicure but I highly recommend this product to anyone that paints their nails on a regular basis and does not want to ruin their nails or change the color more that once a week or pay for the pros to do it. They also have very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Serving as an important part in growing out my natural nails after leaving the world of acrylics behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all of the hype is about this product. I apply two coats of gelous, then two coats of reg nail polish, then another coat of gelous, and my nails last three days max without chipping. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and have never made it more than a few days without having to re-do my nails. I painted my nails on Friday, and it is Tuesday and I have chips all along the tops. I was incredibly hopeful after reading the reviews, but haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product made my polish last longer</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Get what you want!!!!</li>
            <li> keeps the nail polish on longer. Stay at home mom who washes dishes and stuff all day long</li>
            <li> this stuff rocks. i love how my nails look when i go to get gel manicures at salons, but i was starting to worry that i was stripping my nails each time i would take the stuff off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this product, i use it as i&#x27;ve read others suggest: one thin coat gelous on nail, one thin coat polish, one thin coat gelous, one thin coat polish, one thin coat gelous, one thin coat top coat (i use seche vite fast dry top coat) and my nails have never looked this great, doing it alone. nor have they lasted this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;awesome product. would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have always had nail polish peel off within less than 24 hours. I hate the look of chipped nails, so this drove me crazy. I have tried ORLY&#x27;s line of base coats, top coats, etc. I&#x27;ve bought just about every long lasting product there is. This product has changed all that. I use a nail dehydrator, then a coat of Gelous, two coats of colored polish, another coat of Gelous, and then Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat. I always end up with perfect nails and usually take my polish off simply because I want a color change rather than because it&#x27;s chipping. I&#x27;ve had manicures last a whole week, which is unheard of with how often I was my hands. I will always use this now and am amazed that the price is so affordable in comparison to some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried that haven&#x27;t worked. Will be a staple in my nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> I used this with Sinful Colors &amp;#34;Cinderella&amp;#34; which is a light blue glittered polish. I find that this brand (even though it&#x27;s the cheapest) stays on the longest with my nails. I did a base coat of this, the color, this, the color, this, and a top coat of Seche Vite fast dry. I painted them on Thursday and they started peeling by Tuesday. I liked that i could peel this off in a whole piece because once my nails start to chip I peel off my polish. It was easy to peel off in full pieces. I really want to try this with OPI Neon nail polishes because those chip on my nails within a day. I want to put it to the test and then hopefully update this and let you know if it works well. I wish it would have lasted closer to a week, but I still thought it did well. since it kept my nails shiny and they feel hardened.</li>
            <li> better than shellac at the nail salon. My polish will easily last a week with this base coat. Have to apply this base coat to clean nails. I use rubbing alcohol to clean my nails before the base coat.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Clean nails&lt;br /&gt;2.  Base coat&lt;br /&gt;3.  First coat of color/polish&lt;br /&gt;4. Another coat of base coat&lt;br /&gt;5. 2nd coat of color/polish&lt;br /&gt;6. Another coat of base coat&lt;br /&gt;7.  Best if you use Seche Vite Top Coat it dries instantly and lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wait between coats. Just keep applying. Top coat dries instantly and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I use mine as a top coat and my nails stay done and shiny for about one week without chipping. If I reapply it, it can stay on for two weeks without chipping. I want to try it as a base coat. Also my nails grew so much and are so much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> such an awesome alternative to getting gel nails at the salon.  this stuff works miracles.  im tough on my nails, I have a nervous habit of rubbing my nails when ive got polish on and literally by the end of the day ive rubbed half of it off.  if had this on (with another color) going on two days and they still look freshly painted.  ive also had NO problems w/ taking it off. I had non acitone  polish remover and it came right off.</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails hard, but it&#x27;s not a thick gel-type consistency. -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it if you want  -</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER : THIS ISNT A TOP COAT PEOPLE! AND TECHNICALLY NOT A TRUE BASE COAT !This is my addiction!  I have the worst nail chemical balance.  No matter what brand I use my nails always seem to chip within hours!.  Granted I do change my polish every other day. I paint my nails with this and I can work my full 12 hour shift at a hospital constantly washing my hands with out getting an embarrassing chip during the day. Follow the instructions below carefully for that perfect gel like manicure ... DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID OF THE COATS IT DRIES FAST AND GLASS LIKE!&lt;br /&gt;2 coats of gelous ( or one base coat and one gelous)&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of your preferred color ( if it&#x27;s cheaper polish that tends to bubble use a thin layer ... the gelous will &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; the bubbles in the end)&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of gelous&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of the color ( if your color is a one coater skip this step and go straight to your top coat)&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of gelous&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of your fav top coat (I&#x27;ve used seche vite and julep top coats both work AMAZING)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, 7 coats of polish but it dries just as fast to the touch as any other manicure. I do this before bed and never wake up with bed sheet marks. Seche Vite is also the best top coat. I&#x27;ve never looked back since. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of gelous. I don&#x27;t know what I did without it! My nails don&#x27;t grow bc they break ... I&#x27;ve cleaned my pool this summer... ran around like a maniac at work,  worked out,  my nails have not once broken!</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t grow...they just simply don&#x27;t...they get a certain length and then just break!  I&#x27;ve tried everything, even getting acrylics put on (which is super expensive)...one thing that DID make my nails long and strong were gel manicures but, once again, SUPER expensive....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started searching one day for an at-home alternative to gel manicures and I came across this product...now, I can&#x27;t do my nails without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are growing, they&#x27;re hardened, they&#x27;re stronger than ever and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  The key is to do THIN layers of everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do:&lt;br /&gt;one coat Gelous&lt;br /&gt;one coat nail color&lt;br /&gt;one coat Gelous&lt;br /&gt;one coat nail color&lt;br /&gt;one coat Gelous&lt;br /&gt;Clear top coat (quick drying is best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Dry for a bit between coats*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My color has lasted as long as 1.5 - 2 weeks with this method and my nails continue to grow and look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Ah ha.....I added my favorite polish color to Gelous and it works just fine.  It isn&#x27;t an intense  color but stays on for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I never painted my finger nails because the polish always chipped so quickly. This gel really helps keep my clear polish in tact for at least a week. Haven&#x27;t tried it with a color coat because I normally prefer the natural look.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to make your polish last all week!! Make sure to apply it directly to clean nails. Take alcohol or vinegar to your nails first then apply when dry. Dries quickly and makes your nails hard as rocks. This is a must have girls!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like Gel UV, except to harsh light</li>
            <li> I had a $5 off coupon from Sally Beauty and decided to purchase this. It is pricy but I think it&#x27;s worth it. It made my polish look gelish and gave that wet look -which I love. I used it as a base coat and then top coat. HOWEVER, IT DRIES SLOW. Be careful or it will smudge... but you can always fix it. It&#x27;s very protective and it lasts for awhile but then it loses it&#x27;s wet look. Still, it does it&#x27;s job on anti-chipping. Use a shiny top coat to maintain it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> Made the mistake of taking it to the nail salon and having it applied after a manicure. She applied one clear coat then one polish color, then one coat gellous, another coat polish, and another coat gellous. Then stuck me under regular heat lamp to dry. When I left I noticed I had bubbles and roughness over each nail. Needless to say I went home and re-did my nails. Trick is to apply thin coats and allow some drying time in between. Now looks fabulous, lasting one week so far. Good bye expensive gel nails that weakened my nails to begin with!  Highly recommend. But go buy it at Sally&#x27;s ...much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have not had a manicure last longer than 24 hours with this stuff. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Now my wife&#x27;s nails last all week</li>
            <li> I bought this for me girlfriend and she loves the shine it brings to her nails.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails really pretty and shiny but it still chips. Im not sure how to prevent that</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, haven&#x27;t had enough time to really test it. However my step mother told me about it and says it works great. As much as she does her nails I trust her and Im sure it will do exactly as espected</li>
            <li> I have honestly not noticed a major difference if my polish laster longer or not.</li>
            <li> Great top coat, keeps polish adhered and shiny.</li>
            <li> Comes with a wide flat brush which makes getting it on a bit quicker. Really does hold polish on!! I always chip polish (first day) and this has made my manicure last a really long time.</li>
            <li> this stuff is supposed to make your nail polish last as long as gel nail polish does. i should have known there was no way that was true, but i was hopeful. it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it last any longer than it would without this base coat, even when following specific DIYs for longest lasting polish. it also seemed to really stick to my nails and make it so that pieces of the top layer of my nails peeled off. not a fan - just use a regular base coat and good polish and you&#x27;ll get the same results.</li>
            <li> The best price and delivered to your door! This base coat is the best out there. I&#x27;m using it in place of investing in gel nails and my manicures last just as long. I do my nails at home now and I save money and time. This base coat makes all the difference. I have my hands in water off and on all day and I am hard on my nails. If my manicures last for a week anyone&#x27;s will. This product really works.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry..</li>
            <li> For me this product is multipurpose. I use it as a basecoat/topcoat over nail decals, rhinestones &amp; smoothing out textured glitters. The formula is thick like gel, easy to work with &amp; completely levels out creating the perfect finish for your nail designs. The shine &amp; wear is phenomenal (picture below is 8 days &amp; counting ). Although I have to mention that I always wear rubber gloves while doing work around the house. It doesn&#x27;t discolor or shrink your polish, plus it keeps my rhinestones from falling off much better than Seche Vite.  It&#x27;s my absolute favorite for nail art. I truly recommend this brand to anyone that loves nail art &amp; anyone who likes wearing their polish for more than a week.</li>
            <li> The packaging was poor quality which allowed the bottle to spill and had caked the lid shut w excess polish.  I had to soak the bottle in some polish remover to be able to open.  There was not enough polish lost to warrant the time or effort to return for a replacement.  So far the base coat works fairly well.  Only frustration was the condition of the product upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I have seen this all over Pinterest and I wanted to know if it could work for me. It makes the manicure last longer and feel stronger. I need to do more testing with different brand combinations. but I defiantly think this is a good ting to have in a collection!</li>
            <li> I found a video on how to use this product.  I was told to put on two coats of the Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat, then put on a coat of your favorite nail polish, another coat of the Gelous Nail Gel and then a Top Coat.  It lasted about three days vefore the tips of my nails started chipping, without doing much of anything except maybe washing my hands.  I didn&#x27;t do any cleaning, and use gloves anyway.  So, for me, this product did not work.</li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin when i use the gelous nail my nails are harder and alittle less likely to break</li>
            <li> This get coat helps any nail color stay chip free for longer than any other top/base coat I&#x27;ve tried. Turn any regular nail polish into a gel manicure with no need for a uv lamp!</li>
            <li> This makes my manicures last for at least 2 weeks, and longer if I reapply. Depending on how many coats you apply, it also seriously thickens the nail. My nails hardly ever break.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this my nails look like its been professionally done. The gloss is perfect. Will definitely be buying more from this seller...</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat not a base.  It makes my nail polish last a week if I use gloves when doing the dishes.</li>
            <li> I know everybody loves this stuff so I tried really hard to figure something out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with different top coats, with no top coat, with different polish brands. I&#x27;ve tried it between layers of polish, just as a base coat, just as a top coat, and as both base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t matter what I try. On me, this polish bubbles every time. The only time it hasn&#x27;t completely ruined my mani as it dries is if I use it just as a clear coat over bare nails. I&#x27;ve never had bubbling issues with anything else.</li>
            <li> Not as durable as a salon gel manicure,  but definitely more durable than anything else I have ever used at home.  I can get a good week out of any color I choose when I use this under!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!!  When I&#x27;d self-manicure I used to just use 2 coats of polish... And the color would chip in a day.  I now do two coats of polish then 2 coats of this, and my manicure will go 2 weeks.  Love it!!!  Such a time saver.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, thank you so much, a friend gave me some of this and I bought myself and her one too!!  Great product, keeps my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> I got this from sallys beauty supply and i really like it! The only problem i had was it peeded off quickly</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite base coat! It goes on thick, but dries quickly. I like to use it as a base coat and as a top coat. It leaves my polish looking fresh for almost a week, and that is a long time for me.</li>
            <li> I love Gelous Base Coat! My nails look presentable for 4-5 days instead of only 2-3. That works for me!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do more than a clear coat... Super disappointed and annoyed that I wasted money on it</li>
            <li> I usually used to get gel nails at the nail spa and it does give almost the same effect and much easier to remove. it works with all nail paints. Really happy with the purchase as it is very easy to apply and not at all expensive when compared to getting a gel color at a nail spa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used Gelous base coat as a top coat on the regular polish that&#x27;s put on acrylic nails for a while now and have had good results. It stays shiny for weeks  at a time.  I found that it is best to dry the color polish with a blow dryer for a while before applying the top coat so that the color is partially dry and doesn&#x27;t bleed through when the top coat is applied. Then I put the nails under a uv light  for 4 to 8 minutes to finish  them for a truly professional job. I find that after a week or so that a light buffing with a soft cloth renews the shine. This removes  any residue from soap, etc that has accumulated during the week. I do this often to keep them shiny.  Hope this helps as many of the tips I&#x27;ve read in reviews of products has helped me.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using another base coat again. Honestly, I use it as a top coat too because of how quickly it dries. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have watched videos and read up on this polish. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to dry. I would think it would work better with a UV light.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to go the salon route and followed YouTube suggestions. Well worth the price and very satisfied with the results. Dries very quickly with minimal chemical smell. Will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> This has helped to keep my nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> I still apply my regular nail polish on top of this gel base. They last longer and dries much faster when I use this base. Has cut my manicure time by half!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my gelous! I read about it online and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I painted my nails a week ago and they are still going strong!</li>
            <li> As alot of reviewers have said, I read about this base coat from Pintrest. I got it at Sally&#x27;s, along with Seche Vite top coat which I&#x27;ve been wanting to try for a long time. Once you get the technique down, this stuff truly makes my manicure last days longer than it usually did before. Here&#x27;s my trial and error run down:  First try: one coat of ACG one coat of color one coat of ACG one coat of color one coat of seche vite allowed about 1-2 minutes to dry between coats  Maybe it was the type of polish I used, China Glaze (it was matte) but I found that by day 4 I could almost peel the polish off. I did apply the seche vite every couple of days and I think that top coat doesn&#x27;t play nice with my China glaze polish because it shrunk the polish on my nails.  The sequence that i did after the third application was this: two coats of ACG one coat of color one coat of ACG one coat of color one coat of seche vite  Wrapping the polish over each nail tips, every coat works wonders. I should mention that the fairly cheap Wet n Wild polish I used held up better than my China Glaze. Keep the coats thin, and don&#x27;t allow too much dry time in between, the base needs something to set on.  I&#x27;m on day 5 and I only have 2 very small chips. Between washing dishes every night, and washing my hair, typing, and moving furniture I am impressed at the staying power. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> i really wanted this to be great... but its okay... i was a nail salon gel mani girl for months and i wanted to try this so that i could save money and also not damage my nails as much. well this did help my nails grow strong and long when i wore it alone. but with other colors it didnt really prevent my polish from chipping. within two days it would chip with most colors... and after a few wks of using it it got really gooey and thick in the bottle and would leave air bubbles when i would apply it... oh well...</li>
            <li> Bought this as an alternative to buying a UV light for gel manicures at home. Painted my own natural nails and although there were slight dings and chips, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be. I would definitely buy this again and would recommend this as a cheap substitute for salon gel manicures for those who like to dabble in doing their own nails.</li>
            <li> I use before every nail painting, and sometimes between coats. When you apply your color over this, don&#x27;t be afraid to put a lot on, as this Gel Base coat just soaks your color right up. Which is a good thing for me, making my manicure last longer. Don&#x27;t forget a really good top coat.</li>
            <li> No different than any other basic top coat. Nails still chip after a day or so. It does make them shiny, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ve found Essie Gel Setter top coat is the only one that really works for me, so that&#x27;s what I use now.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my nail polish last over a week.</li>
            <li> I got this at Sally Beauty products. I was looking for a nail strengthener and bought this one as per the recommendation of one of the salesladies.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if its a coincidence or not, but since I started using this product, I already broke two nails :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and will dry relatively fast, but I did not feel it made my nails any stronger at all.&lt;br /&gt;AS per another recommendation (this time, from a friend), I&#x27;m going to order the Nail Tek. the difference is only a dollar and I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed for better results.</li>
            <li> I found a Pinterest about how to create your own gel nails.. instead of spending a fortune at the nail salon. I bought this and OMG! It works so well :) Very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I love using this as a topcoat.  It helps manis/pedis last two plus weeks, and gives a gel look without the drying.</li>
            <li> So I bought this probably about two months ago, and have been using Selche Vita, (not sure on the spelling) as a top coat. Well for about the first month Gelous was working GREAT. I would layer gelous, nail polish, gelous, nail polish, then Selche as my top coat. It made my manicures last 4-5 days, which is AWESOME for me because previously my nails would chip the first or second day. I was so excited and thought I had finally found my go-to! However over the past few weeks, my nails have been chipping on the second day. I have been doing the same exact routine and using the same polish that I had been using so I&#x27;m not really sure what has changed. Very disappointing. I am going to repurchase when my bottle runs up to see whether or not this happens again.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice that this product keeps my nail polish on longer. It seems the same time as when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping to extend the life of my at home manicures and was very disappointed.  Not only did it fail to make my manicure last longer than 3 maybe 4 days before chipping, it ruined my nails.  It took about 8 weeks for my nails to stop peeling and breaking after using this product just once.</li>
            <li> This product works, but if you get it on your cuticles at all (even with the vaseline trick) it sticks.  As it dries, it becomes very hard to clean up without making the bottom edges look uneven.  Also, if you have a dark nail polish, the layers can be cumbersome time wise.  You definitely have to let each layer dry completely, or the color comes onto the brush. Magically, though, the color does not transfer into the gelous.  It seems easier to get it done, because it took over an hour for all drying to happen, and then the clean up was a bit frustrating (I ended up trimming it from the cuticles, rather than put Acetone on it).</li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin and usually tear straight off if they grow past my fingertip. I got an itch to be girly and try to grow them out. My local Sally&#x27;s recommended this product as a way to strengthen my nails. Holy schmoly! My fingernail BROKE for the first time ever. That might sound like a bad thing, but it means that it was finally strong enough to not tear, but break. Yes, I danced a happy dance for a broken nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As awesome as it makes my nails feel, I am equally if not more so impressed by its performance as a clear coat. For me it dries incredibly fast. I put it on two minutes ago and I&#x27;m typing this review fearlessly. I can&#x27;t say how long it lasts because I remove it every three days or so to shape my nails and oil my cuticles, but I believe those that say it sticks around for a week plus.</li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t this stuff talked about more?! I always see shilling for Seche Vite and other top coats, which I&#x27;ve tired. Seche Vite is good, not doubt, but you&#x27;re only gonna get an extra day or two of wear with it. This stuff, on the other hand, makes my polish last for at least a week and a half with NO CHIPS. Just make sure you let each coat dry completely before adding another. I actually put this on at home after a salon manicure and it makes it last twice as long. It also comes off with regular nail polish remover like a regular polish would and doesn&#x27;t require the acetone soak like regular gels. Bottom line: you need this in your life.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li> When I use this, my manicure lasts incredibly longer than without its use.  I apply in this order:&lt;br /&gt;- One coat of your choice of basecoat (my go-to is Revlon colorstay gel smooth nail enamel)&lt;br /&gt;- Two coats of Gelous&lt;br /&gt;- One coat of your nail color of choice&lt;br /&gt;- One coat of Gelous&lt;br /&gt;- One coat of your nail color of choice&lt;br /&gt;- Apply topcoat (my go-to is HK Girl topcoat...no shrinkage and fantastic shine)&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for EVERY manicure since I have purchased, and my manicure lasts at least five days, without chipping or peeling. I don&#x27;t see how one would not want to use this to extend nail polish wear!  In my opinion, a hands-down must-have!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  On natural nails it can be used as top and bottom coat.  It really helps keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> Gives a gel shine and keeps my manicure going for two weeks without chipping.Saw it on Youtube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for gel nail polish look:1st coat Gelous, second coat nail polish, third coat Gelous, fourth nail polish, fifth Gelous and sixth Seche Vite Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about the layers, if you use Seche Vite it dries hard in seconds and super shine! Gel look for pennies,less than half the time and no UV! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> I am not great with doing my nails, but wanted to enjoy my nail polish a little bit longer than, say, 10 minutes when I use traditional polish. I&#x27;m super hard on my nails and this stays on a full 3-7 days, which is awesome for me. I use hard as wraps as a base coat, then color, gelous, color, gelous, and a speed dry topcoat.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for a manicure that lasts 3-6 days.  I am always cleaning so my manicures chip, this one lasted 4 days with no chips even when I was cleaning and doing other household chores. Maybe I should invest in rubber gloves too ;).  I do one coat Gelous, one coat nail color, one coat gelous, one coat nail color, top coat then last coat Gelous.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  This product is amazing!  I honestly don&#x27;t think my nails have ever looked better.  So shiny and vibrant.  This product is a holy grail product for me.  I used this during the holiday season and I got so many compliment.  If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get a gel nail look with having to fork over 30-40 dollars this is for you!</li>
            <li> So much for Gel nails. No matter how many coats of this I put on, my nails still cracked the next day. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Pretty good last longer than normal but not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right. I will reorder better than nothing</li>
            <li> Works really well to thicken the nail and, when used as a layering between coats of color, really gives the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect! My only problem with this polish is the brush! It&#x27;s way too thick so a lot of product gets wasted and makes cleaning less than ideal</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this polish yesterday and I was super excited. I used the Orly bonder base coat first, then the gelous, the Opi you&#x27;re such a Budapest, then gelous, and sally hasen intra-dry top coat. Now the probem I had were little smudges. I applied the top coat again and I was good. What I realized it the gelous nail polish works but you have to be patient and let each layer of polish fully dry and apply thin coats. I redid my nails and I love them!I purchased my at Sally Beauty. Its so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use 3-4 coats of this first, then a few coats of any nail polish, and clear coat on top and it looks and lasts just like a salon gel mani. I absolutely LOVEEE this :) :)</li>
            <li> need more time to evaluate this product but it seems to be working to a degree.  some of my nails are still peeling.  will come back to  give a fuller review later.</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t thin, and they grow - but polish just wouldn&#x27;t stick to them.  I don&#x27;t mean that they would chip, but no matter what I used if my hands got wet the polish would peel off in sheets.  With this polish, if I gently rough my nail and use it as a base and between each layer of polish (covering the edge of the nail with each Gelous coat) the polish stays until I remove it.  Seriously - no chipping, no peeling - up to 3 weeks.  Sure, by that point my cuticles are a mess, but the Gelous keeps the polish I put on securely in place.  I can use my nails for things and they stay strong with no chipping or ripping of the nail.  It removes just fine with regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat. It&#x27;s better than any other that I&#x27;ve ever tried. No joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/27/15  I used this with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat and my manicure is still going strong.  No chips, after 3 days!!  This base coat also dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far but I think I like it.  My polish seems to have lasted a few days longer than usual and it looks even and smooth.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> No chipping or cracking after using this base coat.  My manicures last days longer now and I am very happy about that!</li>
            <li> It would have been a little more helpful to have instructions. I opted with checking with a professional at a nail salon to see if it needed primer etc.  Works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> The best product in nail care. My manicure is now a week old and loss like I got it done a day ago</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the bottle was slightly opened and had leaked out all over the bottle and the inside of the package. I did not receive a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to prevent early chipping of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Note: I&#x27;m reordering this again after a year since I last had a bottle, so this is based on memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: when done correctly, this is a phenomenal substitute for a professional gel mani (or really any mani). I get manicures maybe once every 4-5 months but try to paint my nails at home regularly (trying to break that nail-biting habit, per usual), and this has made my at-home attempts a million times more legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you really have to use it correctly. Looks like a couple people have mentioned it here, but to reiterate, I do six steps: thin coat of this, thin coat of color, another thin coat of this, another thin coat of color, another thin coat of this, top coat. THIN THIN THIN is the operative word or it will never dry / bubble up and smear / other horrible things. Also, if you have short nails like mine, make sure you drag each coat of this over the tips of your nails (basically painting a little on your fingertip skin, which you can then easily remove with acetone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major con and minus one star is that this stuff starts to congeal and thicken in the bottle pretty quickly, especially if you keep it in a hot place (actually, what would happen if I froze it?) You&#x27;ll want to ditch the bottle once you use up about 2/3rds, which will probably get you through 10ish manis.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Before, my manicure might last a week...maybe...With this gelous, my manicure lasts over two weeks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> I use it to sandwich in between my layers of polish, add one final coat before I put on Seche Vite topcoat to prevent shrinkage, and voila!  A mani that lasts me over a week with no chips!  You must carefully wrap your nails or you&#x27;ll still get tipwear.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my polish on a decent amount of time.  Not as tough as real gel nails, but also no UV lights or acetone soak is necessary.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product. I did like it and it is a good alternative to shellac, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long. Mine lasted 1 1/2 weeks before it chipped off. Which is longer than most nail polishes last, but still is all the great when compared to shellac.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and thick. Layer it as a Basecoat and a top coat for gel like nails that last pretty long.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a wrap  base coat and a rubber base coat  to compare. This does dry the fastest of the three. However all three start chipping within two to three days after application. So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails. It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li> This made my manicure last a full week but after continued use, my nails really dried out and started peeling. I recommend using it once in a while.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.  Followed the instructions from Pinterest.  Polish stayed on a week.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. My nail polish came right off hours after it was put on</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Polish tends to come off in one sheet.  I wanted the look of gel nails.  I get about 10 days of chipless wear without using this and sticking to OPI.  With it, it&#x27;s only 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> gives thicker glossier look what i was looking for ... took a little while longer to dry would purchase again</li>
            <li> I have never wanted to give a rave review more than I do right now! I am constantly redoing my nails after only a day or two without chips. Even if they don&#x27;t chip right away, they look dull and lose their shine right away. I used this as my base coat AND my top coat and my nails are invincible.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle works great! Easy to take off too!</li>
            <li> Used this on splitting nails a few times and WA-LA, they don&#x27;t split anymore! Awesome! So nice to have a product actually WORK!</li>
            <li> Good get base; I have to say it doesn&#x27;t cling to my nails as long as I was hoping, but better than many I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product on Pinterest. It made my nail polish last for 7 days. I am brutal on my nails too. With all of my daily tasks, the kids and yardwork, this stuff passed the test! I used this gel polish over my regular nail polish I bought at the drug store (Sally Hansen). I&#x27;m very pleased with this stuff!</li>
            <li> This polish is great because it does not mirror and actually help your base color.</li>
            <li> It feels tacky for about an 2 hours even after putting it in an LED light</li>
            <li> I thought this was just OK. You can&#x27;t really compare to a gel manicure. I followed the instructions and was pleased, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Great results at a fraction of the cost. Why spend more when you can get this easy to use product.</li>
            <li> The old saying goes, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t believe everything you read on the internet&amp;#34; is the reason why I tried this product out. Multiple blogs and social media sites rave about how wonderful this product due to how long it extense a nail color manicure. There are claims of it making a manicure last up to 12 days with chip free, peel free results. But all these sites do not state *what* routines were endured by the nails that had this product on them. As a homemaker and full time parent, I decided to put this product through the wringer. Using this product along with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat and following very specific application instructions, I was able to get my nail color to last exactly seven days before it even started chipping off. During the seven days, the hands and nails underwent my daily routine of house cleaning and scrubbing (no gloves), food prep, hand washings, laundry folding, working out, and everything in between. The very tip end of the nails wore down very slightly but it just made the manicure look better with a smoothed down tip. I had no cracking, chipping, or peeling till exactly on day seven. That fact that my nail color last that long really impressed me. I am really glad I tried this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it gives you a gel manicure at home! I got 2 one for my daughter and one for myself I would order and will again and again. I think you would love it too.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes the polish last longer!</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out, I saw this on pinterest and had to try the &amp;#34;at home gel nails&amp;#34; I also bought the suggested top coat (AMAZING top coat).  They looked awesome to start with but mine didn&#x27;t last anywhere near the promised time.  My polish usually chips within a day or two and I started having chips after just 2 days.  I&#x27;m trying for a second time and this time I filed my nail surface a bit and wiped down with rubbing alcohol hoping to get a better bond, not sure if that was the issue....  Seems to dry quickly and I LOVE the wide brush, so much easier to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> This totally works.  Base coat, gelous coat, paint color, gelous coat, another color coat and then a top coat - your nails will look perfect for 5 days.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This nail polish stays on for 2 or more weeks. I wore it by itself. It&#x27;s also pretty thick so it sort of fills in the ridges on my nails.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i use a base coat, followed by this, and while it is still slightly wet, apply the nail color. Put a layer of this in between each layer of color and then put this on top of the final coat of color. Then use a quick dry shiny top coat! and you are done! this usually lasts me about 2-3 weeks on my finger nails (and i work with my hands a lot doing things. a normal manicure lasts for like a day if i&#x27;m cautious). This stuff also makes my fingernails and toenails much stronger and therefore they are able to grow and do not break as easily. The only downside is that you have to use acetone nail polish remover to get rid of it. IF you try to peel it off, it will take part of your nail with it.</li>
            <li> My nails looked salon-quality after they were done, however the manicure did not last as long as I expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I bought because I saw it Pinterest and I needed a really good base coat. It still is a good coat but it still chips on me, however I do use my hands more than most people. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product</li>
            <li> I read up how this product can make your regular nail polish last longer, and have more of that &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; effect without having to use the gel/shellac polishes. It&#x27;s true, it does work. My polish did last longer than usual, with much less chipping. It isn&#x27;t 100% like gel polish, but it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish helps my nail color last so much longer than it would by just applying two coats of regular polish and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nail polish chips less often with this polish than without it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two bottles of this, one for me and one for my mom. My first bottle is almost done and my mom&#x27;s only used it once. I can&#x27;t do my nails anymore if it isn&#x27;t without this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product:&lt;br /&gt;I apply this polish as my base coat and let it dry for about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I then apply a coat of my regular nail polish color.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I apply another coat of the Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat.&lt;br /&gt;I then apply my second coat of my nail polish color.&lt;br /&gt;Top coat&lt;br /&gt;Then the Gelous base coat.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I skip the normal top coat and just use the Gelous base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem like I&#x27;m using a lot this product but I like to make sure my nails stay as nice as possible for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;You can also just apply this base coat, apply your polish color as usual, then top with this gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this polish to anyone who is as obsessed with nail products as I am or to anyone who wants the gel nail look without having to get an actual gel manicure done. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than actually going to the salon and you get great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really wimpy nails. They peel, split and tear.  I&#x27;ve spent most of my life picking and biting at them, and then been ashamed of the mess I have on my hands. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Hard As Nails, Nailtiques, professional manicures, eating jello, vitamins... nothing made a difference until I got this product on a whim. It is the only thing that has actually made a difference in my nails. I use one coat and change it every few days. For the first time in my life, my nails are growing, they are harder, they don&#x27;t peel and I&#x27;m not pestered by little rough spots that lend to picking or biting. For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t try hide my nails when pointing to something or doing something with my hands. This product has done everything that other products have promised, but for less (in most cases). Well worth the $6.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I bought this product. First time I applied this polish, my manicure lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> This product helps my DIY manicures last much longer than just painting my nails with polish only.  I have been doing two coats of the Gelous Base, than a coat of polish, another coat of Gelous, another coat of polish, and then a top coat. (Allowing time for each coat to dry in between coats) It lasts for days, even through the rigors of housework and daily life with 4 kids.  I find my polish to be a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for a while afterward, making it easy to dent.  But after it hardens, my nails look fantastic and my polish lasts without chipping.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions that I found online for a Gelous manicure, but my polish started to chip the next day.  This stuff dried my nails out and now they are peeling.</li>
            <li> You can get this from sallybeauty.com for about half the price. I love this basecoat, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for it!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this base, but it is indeed the only one I have ever used! I&#x27;m not really sure if it is a stand out product! I have two things to add though, the polish does tend to peel off in big chunks after a few days, so I purchased Oraly Bonder tonight not sure if it will help keep polish on! And if drying is a problem , I use a quick coat and it works great afterwards...</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. It covers wonderfully and is fairly priced.  I love being able to do my own gels!!</li>
            <li> search for gel manicure on Pinterest and follow the instructions - multiple thin layers. lasts for at least a week, if not more with minimal chips. highly recommended! (but you&#x27;ve got to do the multiple layers)</li>
            <li> Love it worth every penny!!  I saw on pinterest how to do gel nails with this. Works great eveytime and a lot. Cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Love it use it everytime i do my nails!</li>
            <li> Amazing! My nail polish lasts a week with absolute minimal wear, and I&#x27;m hard on my hands. I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;ll listen. I just recommend using seche Vite as your topcoat; any non-fast drying topcoat will not work well, takes forever to dry and ends with smudging. For reference, before when I just used seche clear and vite, my polish would last two to three days. I see varying instructions online for this product. I do gelous as a base, one coat color, second coat gelous, second coat color, seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item twice. One for my friend and one for myself. Unfortunately, did not work out for me. Gelous nail does not, like others have said would, last long. My manicure chips within a day or two, but does give the gel-like look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable!  I haven&#x27;t been able to grown nails since i hit 50; now I can again! Only challenge is figuring out which polishes won&#x27;t bubble up when used in conjunction with it; so far the winners are OPI and most Loreal and Sally Hanson polishes.</li>
            <li> This might have been good, if, as the Sally&#x27;s clerk told me, and the name implies, it was a gel base coat, or had anything to do with gel nails.  Fool that I am, I used it as the base for gel nails.  After 2 hours of curing and reapplying, I finally looked it up, and found it is a traditional nail base coat.  I am too angry to review it as such; will try to get my money back for the misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> Not like gel at all. just a regular clear coat</li>
            <li> Saw this on Pinterest and it is the answer to my prayers. Nothing is more frustrating than doing your nails and having them chip the next day. With this &amp;#34;gel like&amp;#34; polsih, my DIY mani can last AT LEAST 5 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I am not getting 3 weeks out of it but I do get about 1 week and I am very hard on my nails,  It does a great job strengthening my nails so they are not breaking like were so for that reason I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for my wedding as an alternative to an expensive manicure. My nails looked great and my polish stayed in perfect condition for well over a week. It works so well and goes on very smooth. My wedding was august 30th and a majority of the color I used is actually still on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/20/2015: I still like this but I have definitely noticed that it seems to work much better with sheer colors. Shimmery ones are best because it is less noticeable when it starts chipping or fading at the edges.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Keeps the polish for over a week. I was using Deborah Lippmann Gel Lab at $45 but I find this is just as good if not better for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I used it the way everybody is saying to use it, gelous, color, gelous, color, top coat. I used this with a Sinful shine color, which is supposed to be a long lasting color to begin with. The polish lasted a few days before chipping. I am a bit disappointed because I expected the color to last at least a week before it started to chip.</li>
            <li> Works amazing when latered with regular nail polish!!!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this. its just like a gel manicure except without the UV light which can be very harmful. It dries fairly quickly. When i get anxious i peel off my nail polish and when i have this gel on it peels off the entire polish without having to struggle. This is great i very much recommend this gel coat.</li>
            <li> LOVE this as a base and a topcoat. I use this with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and my manicure lasts for two weeks! Best topcoat I have come across.</li>
            <li> This is truly great for a lasting manicure at home which looks professional.  Easy to apply and can be used as a top coat as well. You will love it!!</li>
            <li> This works great and had strengthened my nails so they don&#x27;t tear in the corners anymore.</li>
            <li> It is a goodproduct but I still don&#x27;t get more than 7 days outof manicure...easy to remove..guess I don&#x27;t know tge secret! Lol</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to go to the nail salon and paying $25 just get a gel manicure and most of time it would be the same color because they never really had a big variety of colors to chose from like the regular nail polish. And on top of everything, I was never really a fan of having to stick my hands into a UV &amp;#34;nail oven&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s gel coat for a base and top coat and was greatly disappointed. It tore off the second I did some vigorous or even went to open a can which was aggravating. So I was in Sally&#x27;s and saw this and decided to give it a try. I did not regret it! I love it! It comes out just as beautiful and durable as a salon gel manicure. You just have to have patience with it and it will come out perfect. It definitely protects the nail and doesn&#x27;t dull out the color. I also ended up buying this quick dry top coat from American Classic as well and I found that it helps the gel dry faster. All in all, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this my nails would peel and break. I couldn&#x27;t even get them to grow out. Now my nails are finally starting to grow out with the help of this base coat. The smell is a little strong but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but using this base coat under my polish and then the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce on top made my nails look like I have a gel manicure. Fantastic! No light needed. Will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Before gelous, my nail polish would only last 2 days max. With gelous, it lasts around 5 days. While this still isnt as long as real gel, it is a big improvement. It comes off like regular nail polish and is inexpensive. I have yet to find a regular base coat that lasts this long so I will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. It definitely makes a manicure last longer than usual. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a professional expensive gel manicure, but it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like gold! I will totally be ordering more for myself, sisters and friends! I just love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help nail polish to last any longer than any other base/top coat.</li>
            <li> Polish definitely lasts longer with this gel polish</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong, but my polish peels right off my nails after using this base coat.  I have not been able to get this to work for me.  I had the same issue with the gel polish at the nail salon (the stuff that is supposed to stay on for at least 10 days) as well.  So I am thinking there must be something with the hand soap or lotions I use.</li>
            <li> Why did it take so long for me to find this?! Love it. Perfect for gel mani/pedi out of the salon.</li>
            <li> Helps my manicure last a few days longer</li>
            <li> this stuff actually stays on my fingernails for many days - and nothing I have found has been able to do that! I put sally hansen hard as nails - wraps on top of it for extra protection</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Goes on clear, not tacky at all and dries quickly giving yoi rock hard nails that don&#x27;t chip. Dream product, very happy to have discovered this,</li>
            <li> I bought this after a co-worker of mine told me about it. I was looking for a UV-free (and DIY) gel manicure that was inexpensive. This nail gel did NOT let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usual routine is this:&lt;br /&gt;Base coat by Beauty Secrets&lt;br /&gt;Gel coat&lt;br /&gt;Gel coat&lt;br /&gt;Any nail polish I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; that day&lt;br /&gt;Gel coat&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Top coat by Beauty Secrets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my nail polish has lasted around 5 full days with no chips. That is including me doing the regular stuff that usually tears my nail polish to shreds after just one day (like washing my hands regularly, doing the dishes, bathing, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one downfall: you have to be willing to sit around with the many polish coats drying for around an hour. Even then my polish can sometimes get prints/indentations in it if I&#x27;m not careful. But compared with the time I would&#x27;ve spent at the salon, driving there and back, and paying a whole lot more, I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stuff a million times over.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase of the Gelous Base Coat - I will always keep it on hand and will never use another base coat again. It works as promised and keeps a manicure for at least a week - possibly more, but I usually re-do my nails every Sunday night for the week so I haven&#x27;t tested to see how many days past 7 it will go. :) I attached pictures from last Sunday, right before I took my nail polish off and re-did them. It still looked almost as good as the day I applied. To get the longest lasting manicure, I usually apply it in the following order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. One thin coat of Nail Strengthener (I use OPI Nail Envy Original)&lt;br /&gt;B. Wait 2 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;C. One thin coat of Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat&lt;br /&gt;D. Wait 2 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;E. One thin coat of Nail Polish&lt;br /&gt;F. Wait 4 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;G. One more thin coat of Gelous Nail Base Coat&lt;br /&gt;H. Wait 2 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;I. One more thin coat of Nail Polish (and nail art, if you&#x27;re into it)&lt;br /&gt;J. Wait 5-10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;K. One or two coats of good quality top coat - I use Seche Vite or Out The Door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips: First, the key seems to be to apply thin coats... not so thin that they&#x27;re spotty, but not thick and or &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; - or else all of the layers will get too thick and will take FOREVER to dry. Second, if you get to the end and it is the final step before the top coat, and your coats are too thick and look like they&#x27;ll take ages to dry, fill a shallow bowl with cold water and dip your nail tips in and out for about ten seconds at a time for a couple of minutes... they&#x27;ll start to harden up much quicker. :) And third, this may seem like an aint-nobody-got-time-for-that kind of thing, but for a week-long, chip-free manicure that I can do while watching a 30 minute episode of something on Netflix, it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to extend your nail polish life!  Use as a base coat and in between color coats!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish far as I can tell...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It helps my nail polish last longer and stay much shinier.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well to lengthen the life of a manicure.  Put a coat between each coat of color and on top.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Nothing special. The only plus was that it made my nails super shiny, but other than that it was just like using a regular topcoat. It chipped after only a few days. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Nothing compares to a salon gel nanicure</li>
            <li> I bought this accidentally while buying stuff for a Gelish manicure. The names are similar. I apply a Gelous coat, wait 2 minutes, apply OPI regular nail polish, wait 4 minutes and repeat x 2. I finish with the Gelous. Then, from what I read on Pinterest you are supposed to apply a top coat, but of what I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as tough as gel nail polish but very much better than regular polish. There is a learning curve for me with the Gel stuff so this is about as fast right now.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: lasts longer than regular polish, it&#x27;s easier to apply (it&#x27;s all more forgiving, compared to Gels) and easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t last as long as a gel nail manicure, but it&#x27;s not that, so there.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle, shipping was as usual didn&#x27;t take long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells a little strong but whatever, it&#x27;s nailpolish it&#x27;s not gonna smell like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied three thin coats already, dried fast BUT I don&#x27;t feel like my nails are super strong, nothing incredible. they do look nice. I&#x27;m going to write a review after I apply nail color and a topcoat of this nail polish so I can review how long the color actually lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do lots of dishes, cleaning, etc. so I&#x27;m hoping this lasts long!!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good gel base coat nail polish but I think I found one I like! It works well and brings out the color and doesn&#x27;t dull it what so ever.</li>
            <li> This gel polish is the best I&#x27;ve tried. My nails are growing well. They are strong and healthy. I use it as a base coat then use my regular polish &amp; then a layer of quick dry. The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is INM Out The Door. My polish lasts 15 days plus. I usually change my polish every two weeks. It also is easily removed with regular nail polish remover. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep polish longer. I haven&#x27;t quite mastered a blend or routine like some people seem to have done, but this polish keeps even dark colors chip free for at least five days! (Normally I get two days tops.)</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again that&#x27;s for sure. Chips off too easily. Thought it would work since on Pinterest it says it works as a pseudo gel polish but I guess if you work with your hands it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This polish is okay. It makes my polish stay on for 3 days without chipping instead of 2. It stays shiny until you remove it, not salon shiny, but shinier than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t expect a miracle as these reviews suggest, but I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;- I use this product as a top coat for the shine. I didn&#x27;t find using it as a base coat instead of a top coat decreased chipping. -The drying time is average for a clear coat.</li>
            <li> Never really dried on the nails.  I was left with a gummy nail surface.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this product or waste my money.</li>
            <li> Omg! I am in love with this stuff!! My nails always chip, within hours of a manicure. I&#x27;m currently 4 days into this manicure and NO CHIPS! None!!! Consider me addicted!</li>
            <li> Arrived early and works great.</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish addict. Typically my manicures are chip free for about 2 days and unwearable by day 5 (with base coat, 2 coats of high end polish plus top coat, seche or out the door). I have very weak nails and have tried many remedies. (side note, I usually find supplements (like viviscal) more effective than nail polish treatments) I am on my 7th day of my manicure typing this with minimal chips and hard nails! This product is awesome. I did two gelous base coats, color, gelous, color, gelous, seche. I know is a lot  but totally worth it.  Update: 6/15 I still absolutely love this stuff and hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.  I use it every week and have mastered how to apply it. Gelous, Color, Gelous, Color, Fast dry top coat.    That said, for people who use this method and still get chips 1. I&#x27;m sorry 2. It may be your nail chemical structure or 3. most likely you&#x27;re using the wrong kind of nail polish. This method requires so many coats that it simply does not work with thick polish (thick from being old or just thick like many china glaze polishes or say, an Essie ballet slippers). I also find that one additional coat of gelous is required before the top coat for very thin polishes (like Essie turks and caicos which is really thin).   Also, I had no idea this stuff was going to make my nails healthier. I could never grow my nails because they would peel and rip but now they are so healthy and LONG after going through a few bottles of this stuff and I have not been taking any supplements.  LOVE THIS POLISH!</li>
            <li> Really, really love this base coat. My nails look professionally done and last for days if well cared for.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work with any regular nail polish. It keeps my polish about 7-8 days but I do not like how thick it is. I am sure that is part of the reason it keeps the polish on but it gets kind of chunky and globby. I do one coat gelous, one coat regular nail polish, one coat gelous, 2nd coat regular nail polish, another coat gelous, finish with a quick drying high-end top coat. With this process i get about 7-8 days out of my polish and they really are not chipped on the ends it&#x27;s the outgrowth at the cuticle that bothers me. With putting this many coats of polish on, your polish is very thick and it&#x27;s super noticable at the cuticles when it grows out and my hair does get caught in that area when I wash it. The best part is it comes up with regular acetone and there is no soaking or scaping needed. I loved getting gel nails done at the salon on my regular length nails but I really hated the soaking and the scraping that had to be done and the damage it was doing to my natural nails. The only negative I have found with this after a couple months is it slightly yellows my natural nail but that is much better than the severe damage salon gel polish was doing from the scraping process. I would give this 5 stars if it was not so globby and thick.</li>
            <li> It not really like a gel for the nails. I recommend getting a led or uv lamp and good gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t let it dry fast enough or is it because I use cheap color polish that it flakes off instead of actually chips. I will try again with Essie polish and change my review if it lasts 7 days :)</li>
            <li> it works fine and gives my nail quite a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Great polish but the bottle had opened in shipping I&#x27;m guessing and about a fourth of the product was on the outside of the bottle. Easy clean up but did lose some of the polish.</li>
            <li> I cannot keep nail polish on my nails. It starts to chip within hours after polishing. It doesn&#x27;t matter the brand or application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has allowed my polish to stay on for a week!!! I can do anything, and it doesn&#x27;t start to chip/peel until about 6 days in. The process is a little time consuming, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: 1. light gel coat  2. Polish  3. Light gel coat.  4. Polish.  5. Light gel coat.  6.Top coat</li>
            <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;| Pros |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Dries hard&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly strengthens nails (leaves a matte coating that adheres to the nail after removed with nail polish remover)&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pick up dirt (can be worn without an additional topcoat)&lt;br /&gt;- Takes ~5-6 days to start chipping (when worn on its own)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 medium coats are enough to get your nails smooth &amp; shiny&lt;br /&gt;- Can be removed easily using standard nail polish remover&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts a long time (even w/o regular use); my bottle has lasted over a year w/o drying out.&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonable dent-resistance while drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Cons |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other topcoats (namely Seche Vite)&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes prone to bubbles&lt;br /&gt;- Not entirely scratch resistant (metal zipper put a noticeable rift in mine today)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Tips&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;- Thicker layers &#x3D; noticeably longer drying time</li>
            <li> I picked up this little gem at my local Sally&#x27;s after having seen a few how to do light less gel manicures at home on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My manicures usually last two/three days, four if I&#x27;m luck, before I start to see tip wear. But with this product my first manicure lasted a full seven days and I removed it cause I wanted to change out the color but I had not one chip nor any tip wear at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here what I did.&lt;br /&gt;1. Applied my nail hardener which is Quimica Alemana, http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;nb_sb_ss_i_0_7?url&#x3D;search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords&#x3D;quimica%20alemana%20nail%20hardener&amp;sprefix&#x3D;quimica%2Caps%2C300&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied a thin layer of Gelous and allowed it to dry for a minute&lt;br /&gt;3. Applied a thin layer of any color of choice, I did OPI Coca Cola Red, let it dry for a minute or so  http://www.amazon.com/OPI-Nail-Lacquer-Coca-Cola-Ounce/dp/B000NG90NE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409925780&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;opi+coca+cola+red&lt;br /&gt;4. Applied a thin layer of Gelous and allowed it to dry for a minute or so&lt;br /&gt;5. Applied a second layer of the Coca Cola Red and let it dry for a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;6 Applied a thin layer of Northern Lights Hologram Top Coat for a sparkly affect (OPTIONAL) http://www.amazon.com/Northern-Lights-Hologram-Top-Coat/dp/B000PZA1MC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409925961&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;holographic+top+coat&lt;br /&gt;7. Lastly I applied a thin layer of the Gelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CAP THE EDGE OF YOUR NAILS WITH EACH AND EVERY LAYER OF POLISH.  This gives a thick, fully sealed layer of protection to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing this mani was no different than removing any other nail polish, just used regular acetone with glycerin in it to moisturize my nails.  http://www.amazon.com/Glycerin-Vegetable-Kosher-USP-Quart/dp/B004C7MTLA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409926351&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in other reviews that this product may dry out the nails, on my first try I did not see that at all, my nails werehealthy and normal.  I&#x27;m thinking that after removing this product, just do a nice oil or paraffin treatment just in case or apply so cuticle oil and it would be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t see myself using this product on my regular few times a week manicures as it is a time consuming procedure HOWEVER, I will most definitely keep this in product handy for those special occasions such as vacations, holidays and so on.</li>
            <li> I wish this worked, but it doesn&#x27;t. I already used half the bottle in hopes that it might start helping my weak nails grow by protecting them for two weeks. This polish chips after a day, just like any other regular nail polish. I used it as instructed. My friend at work had the same experience. If I could  have my money back for every gel product and nail strengthener I&#x27;ve tried, I could probably go on a world cruise. The truth is none of them is really effective. They all chip or don&#x27;t do what they promise. I suppose better nutrition has to be the answer. Wish I knew!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Usually my nails start chipping within 1 or 2 days after applying polish and I&#x27;ve had polish on with this for over a week now with only barely noticeable chips at the tips of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: Apply 1 coat of gelous, then 1 coat of polish, 1 coat of gelous, 1 coat of polish, then 1 top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: I&#x27;d recommend using a cuticle softener and being sure to push back your cuticles. Don&#x27;t get the gelous on or against your cuticles as it will make a visible line once the nail grows out a bit. Brush it on just short of the cuticle and then just use your regular polish to fill in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Yes, this stuff is great at resisting chips, but if it does happen to chip or get a deep scratch, it will probably end up peeling off a good bit of extra polish with it as opposed to just chipping right where the damage is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail polish person because it always looks chipped and thin, but this keeps me on top of maintaining my nails.  I&#x27;m always showing them off now, waving them around in business meetings lol.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best stuff ever invented! I don&#x27;t know if I am following the instructions properly, but I do a base coat, let it dry, do my color, let it dry, do a top coat of clear shiny polish and the top it off with the gel again. No chips for two weeks, and still going strong! I highly recommend this, it makes doing your nails so much easier!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! I read about it on Pinterest to have &amp;#34;fake salon gel&amp;#34; nails. Doing 2 coats of this, 1 coat of color, another coat of this, another coat of color, and a final coat of topcoat makes my nails last longer than a week! I work with children so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and normally can only go a day before my nails start chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this base coat about 5 or 6 times already. My biggest issue with this product is that with some nail polishes the nail polishes will peel off in a day or two, even with using a top coat.</li>
            <li> I purchase this constantly. Makes your nail polish last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Works great. It lasts and keeps the shine</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! I bought some for myself &amp; for my sister &amp; we both have been using it regularly. I will say the application process takes kind of a while but it helps my nail polish actually stay on. I&#x27;m the kind of person where my polish usually chips within a day and is horrible after 2 days. With this stuff I can (usually) go up to 4 days with minimal chipping. For my sister it lasts even longer! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does last multiple days!</li>
            <li> The only thing is, you need to put a base coat on before using it, otherwise, it could dry out your nails.  I use my own basecoat, then this Gelous Nail, then my color, then top it with another coat of the Gelous Nail and it&#x27;s amazing.  It keeps my natural nails looking manicured for over a week!  No chips!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I can only give 4 stars, because I just used it for the first time today, so I don&#x27;t know how I will like it long term.  But..I purchased it because I read a lot of good reviews on this product...so my hopes are quite high.</li>
            <li> Not the equivalent of UV gel manicure, but it will extend the life of basic manicure.</li>
            <li> I use this over nail color, then use one layer of a shiny top coat over this.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my manicure last 7+ days.</li>
            <li> Got the gel polish, hoping to a diy mani, and I was SO happy with the results! Used many layers of this polish with a quick dry top coat &amp; normal colored polish, and it literally stayed on 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told others about the product and converted many new fans!</li>
            <li> It works great! I bought this based on these reviews and YouTube reviews and it truly does work! I&#x27;m not easy on my nails either. I use gelous as a base coat and then ONE coat of nail polish and finish it off with a top coat of gelous. Make sure to coat the tips of the nail as well.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing out rough polishes or as a base coat.  Not the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used though.</li>
            <li> Best ever! You must buy! Increases the wear of the your favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> Good Product. Polish lasts much longer with Gelous application.</li>
            <li> It helps the manicure last longer,  but certainly not as long as they claim. I use the Gelous by starting with two coats as a base. then two coats of my color, another Gelous and then a top coat. Sadly, nothing I can find compares to a salon gel or shellac manicure.</li>
            <li> Really does help nail polish stay on longer ... About 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something under $40 to give me a lasting clear shine. This looks great going on. The brush is thick and easy to use. My issue is peeling. I&#x27;ve tried quick dryn( Seche Vite), and even a commercial dryer. However the first time I bathe, it begins to peel. I&#x27;m open to suggestions. It&#x27;s so affordable, I want to make it work.</li>
            <li> as a nurse I wash my hands many times a day. Usually my nail polish only stays on for a day or two before a have to replace it. This polish it stays on for almost 2 weeks. Love it. Will definitely be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! You have to complete the manicure as directed by applying a coat of this then a coat of your nail polish and repeat by layering. Go on Pinterest for details directions. My nails are on day 7 and are perfect! I even do my nails right before bed. I definitely allow more drying time and I finish with drying drops or drying spray.</li>
            <li> One-two day manicure at best</li>
            <li> ooommmgggg!!! Seriously, I wish i found this before I got my Orly Rubberized bonder... This base coat is so good! I did a test and this based helped my nails last for 2 weeks with no chip it in compared to Orly Rubberized Bonder. This trick is to paint the color when the base is still wet, so it will adhere to it better. It does not dry as fast as other base coat so it is really good. Also make sure you seal the edge of your nails with this base coat, it will really make it last.  If you want a DIY gel manicure, this base coat is great for that!</li>
