            <li>My beard was so smooth afterwards; I&#x27;m so happy with this</li>
            <li>it smells nice and a bearded mans scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m honestly torn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sized block of it</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is one of the finest products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband is using this in conjunction with Honest Amish Beard Balm and let me tell you, his beard is glorious.</li>
            <li>This coupled with some beard oil, a nice brush and some trimming scissors makes any beard manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week, maybe more if I smoke a cigar and then follow it up with some good beard oil.  </li>
            <li>Forget touched by a rose.</li>
            <li>Couple it with a nice beard lube</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>He said he liked it.</li>
            <li>I use this and Honest Amish Beard Balm after I shower.</li>

            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>And this product has a nice spicy scent that does not irritate the senses.</li>
            <li>Kind of a leathery pepper smell, but disappears after washing.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice too.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Love the scent - I was expecting a liquid shampoo but the bar is good.</li>
            <li>Lots of lather and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying Beard Oil by Leven Rose.</li>
            <li>Plus fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li>I do not mind the smell, actually kind of like the manly wooded smell.</li>
            <li>It is a cube kind of like a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>And has a very unique, but good smell to it.</li>
            <li>Suds up great and smells just as good as it did when i first opened it.  </li>
            <li>Great woodsy scent that leaves your beard clean.</li>
            <li>Amazing, beard get soft and smells great!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant to those around; though my boyfriend did say that the taste transferred to his lips.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin and the smell is a piney fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>The only reason we didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because he found it works best with a leave in conditioner rather than on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent, gentle shampoo that lathers into a rich wash for the face fur.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my beard nice and clean and helps keep the texture of my beard nice.  </li>
            <li>This goes in easy and has a nice &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation while it works.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant, and we both enjoy it.</li>
            <li>As far as receiving product on time very good.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of beard wash and shampoo but this is by far the best soap available.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did, after just one use my beard is softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more manageable as well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the conditioner and my husband is pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>What more should be said?</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about making the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>fabulous!  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s found it makes his beard softer and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>But I also take a healthy dose of fish oil pills to assist with beard health.</li>
            <li>Me and my man both love this shampoo</li>
            <li>Anyway I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells okay, but my husband&#x27;s beard isn&#x27;t any softer after using it.</li>
            <li>and i really satisfied about the all shipment</li>
            <li>I have very much so enjoyed Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Shampoo.</li>
            <li>love this item.</li>
            <li>will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I quite like this product and fully intend to purchase more when this bar runs out (which should take a while).</li>
            <li>I had never used a shampoo bar before and am quite liking how much more efficient it is than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li>, I only use this product at night, but it helps my beard look awesome!.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Since using it there has been a noticeable difference in how healthy the skin is below the beard.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to store it some place out of your shower stall when you&#x27;re not using it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>but I love it now.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I cut mine into 3 even pieces to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s made with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>love the way it feels in my beard.</li>
            <li>It keeps it healthy, shiny, hydrated and tamed.</li>
            <li>and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li>much like their conditioning gloss, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>My favorite wash to date</li>
            <li>so I kept adding more.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some top quality stuff contained within this pint sized cube.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this when I ordered it as it doesn&#x27;t look like any &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend love the smell it leaves on my beard.</li>

            <li>has never looked better.</li>
            <li>He has really enjoyed the lather that this bar forms while in the shower and the aroma is spicy which I like.</li>
            <li>Seems like an OK product.</li>
            <li>Some times after I shave my head, I even use some up top.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and i use it on my head now, too.</li>

            <li>Overall, this is a great product and I will probably stick with it unless someone suggests another product that they feel makes their beard smoother than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells fantastic and manly -</li>
            <li>but after using the shampoo it started to improve, my beard is smooth, shiny and doesn&#x27;t fall off  like it used to.</li>
            <li>This makes my beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Think it&#x27;s manly to have an all-natural, unkempt, untreated brillo pad filled with tasty morsols of food on your face?  </li>
            <li>But your partner may think so, and that&#x27;s mildly important.</li>
            <li>it may be theregular shampoo and conditioner i always used, but the beard never felt comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great smell and appears to actually bring out some highlights on my beard.  </li>

            <li>leaves my beard soft and smelling good.</li>

            <li>my beard is clean and shiny.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelming smell and so far has been enjoyed by everyone around me.</li>
            <li>and leaves my beard and skin below feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it looks more full, and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard feeling clean, bushy, and i&#x27;d even say lighter.</li>
            <li>Clean beard, no problems.</li>

            <li>This works on getting it clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Makes me smell like a pine forest, but keeps my beard neat and clean.</li>
            <li>soap comes in a nice cube which you just rub directly onto your beard and you create an incredibly rich lather, and then just massage your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes his beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have used regular shampoo and conditioner with fairly good results.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Smells good, wish the sent  would last longer.</li>
            <li>He also uses the shampoo for his Friar Tuck-style hair, and it&#x27;s still lasted a full eight weeks.</li>
            <li>It smells natural and kind of earthy.</li>
            <li>I work outside in the construction industry and get a fair share of dirt and grime in my beard.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, very &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; and lathers almost like a shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It gets a nice lather and leaves my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>He also liked that it came in solid soap form - easy to put in the shower and not another bottle to worry about.</li>
            <li>you want an incredibly smooth beard, buy this right now.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, rubbing an ashtray into my face first thing in the morning is incredibly unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lathered up very nice with minimal soap needed.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a square and easy to fit in my giant man-bear hands.</li>
            <li>It leaves your beard feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Okay I must be a sucker because I bought into their marketing and some of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, and I can&#x27;t simply can&#x27;t help myself from constantly running my hands through it.</li>
            <li>Trying to find a good way to secure it for travel when wet.</li>
            <li>Make it feel so soft and it feels so soft and smell great</li>
            <li>Excellent product and a great base to have to extend the help from post shower oils or balm.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to work through it too quickly.</li>
            <li>Be real its an all natural Soap that does a good job of cleaning and conditioning.</li>
            <li>So I got this for my bearded man because we are in a dryer area and his beautiful beard was getting a little crispy crunchy...</li>
            <li>This product worked not only kept my beard soft and tangle free, but kept my skin under the beard in great shape, no drying of flaking.</li>
            <li>And it is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>clean&amp;#34;-- that is, clean and healthy, NOT DRIED OUT.</li>
            <li>Great beard shampoo, hands down.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was a bit surprised to discover this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; actually resembles a cube of soap, but it really does a GREAT job on my beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my skin less itchy.</li>
            <li>On one hand, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger much after washing and any beard wax/cream will easily cover it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving my beard!!</li>
            <li>Lathers up great, love how it smells, and it seems like it will be long lasting...will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>He has had his beard for 10 years and there have been times when his face gets dry so regular shampoo on his beard is not the best option.</li>
            <li>Just a little will give you a great lather, and wash away yesterday&#x27;s lunch.</li>
            <li>Or it might just be that you don&#x27;t need to use very much for a full lather.</li>
            <li>The wife loves the smell almost as much as i do, which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>Anti Itch beard wash, amazing lather, comes in a pump and only takes one squirt to fully lather your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>I bought it off the recommendation of a coworker and was not disappointment.</li>
            <li>I am now using this beard shampoo on a daily basis and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my beard feels and looks much more sleek and is considerably easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and leaves the beard soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few beard shampoo&#x27;s to date and Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s has worked the best so far.</li>
            <li>He used to get compliments before, but now he gets them far more</li>
            <li>Next to deodorant, this is the most important product in my bathroom...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really convinced a beard shampoo is necessary, but this was an awesome product.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it feels so good on my face that I want to use it too fast</li>
            <li>Well worth it to purchase.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for that freshly shampooed feeling, not the almost dry/tacky feeling you get when using soap...</li>
            <li>Well first off I&#x27;m new to the beard thing,been growing mine for 6 months or so,I tried the same brand fuzzworthy for the beard care and gloss first,thought it was great</li>
            <li>I run it my across my beard in the shower and just a little bit suds up very nicely.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and my son really likes it!</li>
            <li>I just wet my beard, rub the bar across it a few times, and then work the rich lather in for an excellent clean.</li>
            <li>His beard is far more contained and generally looks a lot better after use.</li>
            <li>Cleans my scruffy beard right and smells manly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans my beard very well and you can tell when its clean.</li>
            <li>It smells really earthy and spicy but doesn&#x27;t linger long afterwards, which is good.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard clean and ready for after shower treatments (either oil or balm).  </li>
            <li>He has been growing out his beard for a while and has tried different products to make the appearance more full as opposed to scraggly and for a softer touch.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to strong scents, etc</li>
            <li>Soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It lathers with just a tiny amount into a huge white foam and is basically scentless which is good too.</li>
            <li>Great lather with a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I certainly think that it&#x27;s doing a great job of cleaning my my beard with ought being too harsh.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, and you get a big chunk that&#x27;ll last quite some time.</li>
            <li>Helps with the dry and unruly hairs, and the scent works nicely.  </li>
            <li>With a quick google search, I realized there was a whole world of beard products that I had never known about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make hair super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The key to having a good beard, that isn&#x27;t wild and itchy, is using a shampoo that&#x27;s made for beards.....and not washing it every night.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product again a week ago, and I am writing this review now, with a very clear and smooth face.</li>
            <li>Wet your beard, slide this over the top of your whiskers two or three times and then lather up!</li>
            <li>We received this way faster than expected and love the product!</li>
            <li>No itching or dandruff, Very Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it once a week right now and am excited with how soft my beard has become.</li>
            <li>I now only use this soap along with a good beard balm, as it did get rid of the dry skin and beard dandruff that was caused by my original method of care (shampoo and conditioner) .</li>
            <li>Overall we are pleased with this product and will continue buying it and recommend it to our friends.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had always stuck to the bottled stuff that&#x27;s more like traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know nothing about washing hair, you&#x27;ve been bald for 20 years, you&#x27;re washing it too much!</li>
            <li>With this shampoo, I wake up with a nice, in-control, roughly 3-4&amp;#34; beard.</li>
            <li>The first cube lasted him about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>but I can say that I really do like this product and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo &amp; so does my beard!</li>
            <li>His whatever that is on his face got soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would lather well and do a better job than regular shampoo...something that was made for beards, ya know?  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that where I leave it seems to degrade it more than my actual use.  </li>
            <li>When my boyfriend tried the shampoo for the first time, I almost wrecked my car because I touched his cheek.</li>
            <li>This beard gloss shampoo is pretty</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>My beard is much easier to comb and style and the number of ingrown hairs has plunged to zero!  </li>
            <li>First beard shampoo I ever bought and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>Love the small of this stuff and makes my beard feel really healthy.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a different condition that is working out much better.</li>
            <li>anyway my hubby raves about it and says he wished he had this from the beginning a facial hair growth :)</li>
            <li>They sport some pretty badass whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got a bit of chin hair and keep the top quite short</li>
            <li>My beard is not only softer but also more manageable, so it did as it said it would.  </li>
            <li>I will by more in the future when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will last a while.</li>
            <li>I tried it out for the first time today and this product really works well!</li>
            <li>I use this product a few times a week and am getting reasonably good life out of the bar.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to keep my beard fluffy and smelling good</li>
            <li>It produces a great, thick lather and when I rinse it out my beard and mustache feel incredibly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Great lather after only minimal application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid block of shampoo not liquid, but it has a great lather once you wet it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves the beard feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My beard is so soft,  nourished and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Left my beard super clean.</li>
            <li>After more than a month, it really doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s gotten much smaller.</li>
            <li>It makes my boyfriends beard really soft and he loves it and it has a nice smell to it definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Very cool and different.</li>
            <li>I had been trying a little bit of everything to keep my beard clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It really has left my beard feeling much softer and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Cleans my beard and leaves it full and soft.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the bar will last a good long time</li>
            <li>A bottle of shampoo and conditioner together cost more than a single brick of this manly product.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t dislike this product</li>
            <li>THE SOAP COMES IN A LARGE CUBE.  </li>
            <li>so he would always shave it off at a certain point.</li>
            <li>Second, the smell is interesting - not bad per se but definitely earthy smelling...</li>
            <li>Has great lather and has done wonders to make my beard feel soft and straighten some of my curlier hairs and has cut down on the amount of beard oil I have had to apply since this helps my beard grow uniformly and have a bit of natural shine.</li>
            <li>It comes cube shape, it has a woodsy and a tea tree kind a like smell, it makes a lot of lather with just a little amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel very soft afterward!!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my future son-in-law and he said it made a huge difference in the feel of his beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lathers up really really well.</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;m really growing it out (to the point where I have to trim with shears instead of an electric trimmer</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun idea to buy an old school product</li>
            <li>I get the sense this product is marketed toward modern day hipsters (no offense</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It makes the beard much softer.</li>
            <li>and he said that his beard is no longer itchy and is much softer.</li>
            <li>and you really feel like a man scrubbing your beard with a block of man soap instead of using your wife&#x27;s herbal essence shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest (and I have to my friends) to buy this for the bearded guy (or gal) in your life!</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>He is very picky when it comes to what he uses on his beard.  </li>
            <li>It has a real manly smell.</li>
            <li>stern yet gentle beard care</li>
            <li>I must&#x27;ve missed the part where it&#x27;s really just a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyone that disagrees should really give it another go.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo bar isn&#x27;t really so much of a bar as it is a cube.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and has helped shine up my beard.</li>
            <li>I never thought a beard shampoo can make so much difference.</li>
            <li>The soap comes as a cube, so I took the liberty of buying a travel soap dish and cutting the bar into fourths, which works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Didnt understand how to really use it, should have come with instructions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to come straight out and say it.</li>
            <li>YES it is a very Earthy / Wood Scent.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well, cleans very well and leaves beard feeling softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will get all the dirt and old wax and nonsense out, so you have a fresh beard to start the day with.</li>
            <li>cleans and protects with lovely essential oils that leave my beard soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>He had previously used another product (whose name I cannot recall) but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it as it smelled very strongly of bread.</li>
            <li>WoW!!!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I just rub the bar in a beard a few circles and it suds right up.</li>
            <li>Really works well; left my beard clean and shine</li>
            <li>i also use the amish soap and these both clean the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even found shampoos as basic as Johnson&#x27;s Baby makes it feel clean and healthy/shiny.</li>
            <li>I also expect that it will last quite some time as it doesn&#x27;t take much to come to a full lather.</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using just shampoo and a good quality conditioner on a daily basis to keep my beard from being the Brillo pad/ wire brush constancy</li>
            <li>(I just pick up the cube and rub it across my beard a few times, then lather), smells nice and natural, and really leaves the hair feeling &amp;#34;conditionally</li>
            <li>I literally gasped at how soft his beard was after the FIRST shampooing.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box I was surprised that the bar of soap was brown and square in shape.</li>
            <li>it does get a good lather in the beard, but I did not notice an actual difference between using this and using regular soap or facial wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little unusual, and the &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; description sounds appropriate.  </li>
            <li>My husband is new to beard care products, but loves this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I use it three times per week in combination with a nice beard oil and have seen a dramatic improvement in my beard, both in softness and in overall \\&quot;health\\&quot; (not as many wiry, prickly ends).  </li>
            <li>I really like how soft this makes my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, and he really likes how moisturizing his skin underneath feels.</li>
            <li>and I have tried my fair share of beard products over the last few years.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t try everything at once, but this is a decent place to start.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a serious &#x27;beardsman&#x27;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>If you want your beard to be both daunting and voluptuous, I highly suggest this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I understand why this stuff is so highly rated now.</li>
            <li>I highly advise you to grab a cube of this, slap it on your face and start feeling and looking like a man again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend HIGHLY</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>IT WILL NOT make your beard shine like your super dope wheels on your 90&#x27;s Honda, but will be shinier than the flat paint or powder coat on your fixie bike.</li>
            <li>I have a very long beard and this shampoo keeps it under control as well as keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li>As far as &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t really say,</li>
            <li>The soap seems to get soft fast.</li>
            <li>As my beard got longer it started to get a lot more dried out and wirey,</li>
            <li>I have a full, fairly long beard</li>
            <li>I use beard balm every day and it sometimes doesn&#x27;t wash out with normal water.</li>
            <li>I have been growing my beard for the past 6 months, which I believe is the longest it&#x27;s ever been (nothing impressive, but quite thick).  </li>
            <li>This is a really good shampoo for your beard cleans well only gripe I have about the product I&#x27;m not really into the smell to earthy and hippyish for me but use on my beats daily</li>
            <li>it normally is.</li>
            <li>You want to keep your facial hair fresh.  </li>
            <li>Next day after those shampoos, the beard is okay, but it&#x27;s feeling dry.</li>
            <li>bought this one month ago, and there&#x27;s still enough to last me easily another month, maybe two.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend whom has a very long, full beard.</li>
            <li>Builds a rich lather with minimal usage of the bar.</li>
            <li>This is not a &amp;#34;see instant results&amp;#34; product, but it&#x27;s a great addition to a simple regimen to keep your beard soft and tame (or untamed if that&#x27;s your thing).  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can think, is that it may help dull the points of the hair, which would be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s is gentle enough to use every day and effective enough to use every other day, depending on how my day went.  </li>
            <li>, I guess I&#x27;d expected something more like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard very soft and maintains softness between washes - which occur about every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li>The scent is very natural smelling</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that it was a bar or rather a cube of soap.</li>
            <li>The bar is very dense and long lasting - just a couple of swipes across my wet beard and it soaps up nicely.</li>
            <li>But I just got out of the shower and wow its soft and a ton of color showed up that I did not Know was there !!</li>
            <li>First time I have ever used beard specific products.</li>
            <li>Have been using for the past week and am really glad I got it.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard specific product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that has cured that.</li>
            <li>Keeps your beard healthy or maybe that&#x27;s just me, not sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used regular shampoos and products specifically for beards but nothing left my beard feeling this clean.  </li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week to really deep clean my beard, and this soap does the trick.</li>
            <li>Huge block of soap, that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>just ordered my second bar, even though my first is still half full.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to get away from using my normal shampoo, which dried out my beard and mustache significantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried growing a beard for ages only to shave it off largely cause of the itching and dandruff</li>
            <li>Should definitely store in a small tupperware or similar to increase the life, particularly if your shower is not just your own.</li>
            <li>and it has become wild and untamed.  </li>
            <li>By using this shampoo it leaves it soft and gives me the ability to comb through and set it the way I want it to.  </li>
            <li>it makes my beard so soft that my fiance even enjoys it.</li>
            <li>She immediately wrinkled her nose said &amp;#34;It smells like an old ashtray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I am an old school hipster myself).</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well, so the bar should last a while.</li>
            <li>With your products, he now has a soft, touchable beard.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft and easier to comb.</li>
            <li>So soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO HAVE KEPT MY BEARD SOFTER, NOT BABY SOFT</li>
            <li>I use it on my young beard.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised when this came</li>
            <li>If I leave it in the shower it gets soft and dissolves quicker like any soap bar would.</li>
            <li>And The Wife Digs How Soft It Is.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and no stinky smell in my mustache area.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It resides on a shower caddy under my showerhead, and while the water doesn&#x27;t drip onto it directly, I&#x27;m sure it catches some splashes at least.  </li>
            <li>I have had a beard of varied thickness for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The receiver of this gift was pleasantly surprised by the smell of this item.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really buy any regular shampoo</li>
            <li>Completely eliminates &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Beard is soft and manageable and paired with the wax/conditioner, it is looking like I want it to look.  </li>
            <li>I apply this to my beard in the shower, and when it lathers up the beard is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried different types of soaps but this one really cleans your beard and keeps your skin moisturized .</li>
            <li>It leaves his beard soft.  </li>
            <li>I imagine someone with a thick beard would benefit from it most.</li>
            <li>The soap cleans my beard and &#x27;stache well, but the lather is thick and takes a bit more time and effort to rinse out.</li>
            <li>A little bit creates a really rich lather.</li>
            <li>I first received the product, it was actually a lot smaller than I assumed it would be, maybe 2&amp;#34; cubed, but I have been using for about a month and don&#x27;t feel I will need to reorder for about 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li>My full and soft beard is now fuller, softer and oh so fluffy.</li>
            <li>Now just a little works and it help with the dry skin under the hair way better and faster than oils added after the shower.</li>
            <li>Basically I drag it down each side and across my chin, and get more lather than I could ever need.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and will be purchasing again when necessary.</li>
            <li>personally cannot keep a beard without a product like this, and I look like I&#x27;m in high school without one.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m new to the beard thing, and normally shave it when it gets too long.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - wet your beard and wet the soap.</li>
            <li>I think a fair price should be at least half for what it sells for.</li>
            <li>No more lady soap just to get a smooth looking</li>
            <li>only complaint, is I wish this conditioned the beard a bit more.</li>
            <li>First soap that actually works for long beards.</li>
            <li>This bar format reduces wasted product and is cheap enough to use every day (like it should be)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hypothesized to myself (and now you) that this is partly due to the cube having a higher volume to surface area ratio than a longer, flatter bar.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit drying on my husband beard, may just be because of his type of facial hairs that are pretty dry to start with.</li>
            <li>The soap bar was somewhat large, compared to what I expected.</li>
            <li>Should last a long time - highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I started using this daily every time I showered and it fixed my beard dandruff and any leftover dirt and garbage in it.</li>
            <li>The masculine scent of eucalyptus and testosterone assaulted my nostrils like a tiny team of bearded lumberjacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can barely tell that it&#x27;s even been used.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft and manageable and i am constantly getting complimented on my beard.</li>
            <li>He says it makes his beard soft and manageable, and his skin is not irritated as with regular soaps and shampoos.</li>
            <li>So far, i&#x27;ve used it daily with no complaints.</li>
            <li>The only product that leaves my beard soft after washing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get a lot of use as I have a long beard and the bar is pretty small , but in two week of everyday use it seems like it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>It dries out and can become a hot mess if you don&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
            <li>,the fuzz products compliment each other very well,I&#x27;m growing my beard and I will try competing some day.</li>
            <li>I wasted so much time and money!</li>
            <li>Bought this for the boyfriend, and he brags about it the way a 12 year old girl would brag about meeting Justin Bieber (that must mean he loves it, right?)</li>
            <li>So after reading the mixed reviews on this product I have come to the conclusion, that some people expect miraculous change overnight or after a single use from a bar of soap (because they aren&#x27;t realistic enough to realize its just soap, or that they lack a brain) .</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a cube with hard edges) but lathers quickly</li>
            <li>There can be a bit of a tingling on dry or sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative that I found to this block that will likely last me at least 2 months is the $12 price point, But that&#x27;s for you to decide if a product that can replace two others and keep your beard clean is worth it...</li>
            <li>Rinses cleanly (not greasy/oily) and leaves a nice fragrance behind.</li>
            <li>, the block of soap is pretty substantial for my use, and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>Wife cut down the complaints about scratchy whiskers within those first two days, and it also seems to be moisturizing the skin under my beard, because that feels better, less dry, less tight.</li>
            <li>He uses it every other day in the shower and his beard is much softer and he scratches it far less often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t stick around, which isn&#x27;t really a good or bad thing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly torn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sized block of it</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is one of the finest products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this in conjunction with Honest Amish Beard Balm and let me tell you, his beard is glorious.</li>
            <li> This coupled with some beard oil, a nice brush and some trimming scissors makes any beard manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, maybe more if I smoke a cigar and then follow it up with some good beard oil.  </li>

            <li> And this product has a nice spicy scent that does not irritate the senses.</li>
            <li> Kind of a leathery pepper smell, but disappears after washing.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nice too.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Love the scent - I was expecting a liquid shampoo but the bar is good.</li>
            <li> Lots of lather and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Beard Oil by Leven Rose.</li>
            <li> Plus fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I do not mind the smell, actually kind of like the manly wooded smell.</li>
            <li> It is a cube kind of like a bar of soap.</li>

            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and the smell is a piney fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only reason we didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because he found it works best with a leave in conditioner rather than on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent, gentle shampoo that lathers into a rich wash for the face fur.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my beard nice and clean and helps keep the texture of my beard nice.  </li>
            <li> This goes in easy and has a nice &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation while it works.</li>

            <li> As far as receiving product on time very good.</li>

            <li> I have tried many types of beard wash and shampoo but this is by far the best soap available.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did, after just one use my beard is softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more manageable as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the conditioner and my husband is pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> What more should be said?</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about making the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> fabulous!  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s found it makes his beard softer and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> But I also take a healthy dose of fish oil pills to assist with beard health.</li>
            <li> Me and my man both love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Anyway I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells okay, but my husband&#x27;s beard isn&#x27;t any softer after using it.</li>
            <li> and i really satisfied about the all shipment</li>

            <li> I had never used a shampoo bar before and am quite liking how much more efficient it is than liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> , I only use this product at night, but it helps my beard look awesome!.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Since using it there has been a noticeable difference in how healthy the skin is below the beard.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s smells fantastic and manly -</li>

            <li> This makes my beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s manly to have an all-natural, unkempt, untreated brillo pad filled with tasty morsols of food on your face?  </li>

            <li> It smells like mahogany and rich leathers.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unique, and I like it.  </li>
            <li> Working with my first beard, and this shampoo has made it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> my beard is clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> this has a manly smell i think fits more men, the amish soap has a more natural smell....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overwhelming smell and so far has been enjoyed by everyone around me.</li>
            <li> and leaves my beard and skin below feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it looks more full, and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard feeling clean, bushy, and i&#x27;d even say lighter.</li>
            <li> Clean beard, no problems.</li>
            <li> That said, I really like this shampoo, YES its a BAR form, or more precisely a block.</li>
            <li> This works on getting it clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Makes me smell like a pine forest, but keeps my beard neat and clean.</li>
            <li> soap comes in a nice cube which you just rub directly onto your beard and you create an incredibly rich lather, and then just massage your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes his beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used regular shampoo and conditioner with fairly good results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Smells good, wish the sent  would last longer.</li>
            <li> He also uses the shampoo for his Friar Tuck-style hair, and it&#x27;s still lasted a full eight weeks.</li>
            <li> It smells natural and kind of earthy.</li>
            <li> I work outside in the construction industry and get a fair share of dirt and grime in my beard.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; and lathers almost like a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It gets a nice lather and leaves my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> He also liked that it came in solid soap form - easy to put in the shower and not another bottle to worry about.</li>
            <li> you want an incredibly smooth beard, buy this right now.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, rubbing an ashtray into my face first thing in the morning is incredibly unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lathered up very nice with minimal soap needed.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s a square and easy to fit in my giant man-bear hands.</li>
            <li> It leaves your beard feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Okay I must be a sucker because I bought into their marketing and some of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, and I can&#x27;t simply can&#x27;t help myself from constantly running my hands through it.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a good way to secure it for travel when wet.</li>
            <li> Make it feel so soft and it feels so soft and smell great</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a great base to have to extend the help from post shower oils or balm.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to work through it too quickly.</li>
            <li> Be real its an all natural Soap that does a good job of cleaning and conditioning.</li>
            <li> So I got this for my bearded man because we are in a dryer area and his beautiful beard was getting a little crispy crunchy...</li>
            <li> This product worked not only kept my beard soft and tangle free, but kept my skin under the beard in great shape, no drying of flaking.</li>
            <li> And it is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> clean&amp;#34;-- that is, clean and healthy, NOT DRIED OUT.</li>
            <li> Great beard shampoo, hands down.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was a bit surprised to discover this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; actually resembles a cube of soap, but it really does a GREAT job on my beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my skin less itchy.</li>
            <li> On one hand, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger much after washing and any beard wax/cream will easily cover it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for saving my beard!!</li>
            <li> Lathers up great, love how it smells, and it seems like it will be long lasting...will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> He has had his beard for 10 years and there have been times when his face gets dry so regular shampoo on his beard is not the best option.</li>
            <li> Just a little will give you a great lather, and wash away yesterday&#x27;s lunch.</li>
            <li> Or it might just be that you don&#x27;t need to use very much for a full lather.</li>
            <li> The wife loves the smell almost as much as i do, which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> Anti Itch beard wash, amazing lather, comes in a pump and only takes one squirt to fully lather your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> I bought it off the recommendation of a coworker and was not disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am now using this beard shampoo on a daily basis and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my beard feels and looks much more sleek and is considerably easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and leaves the beard soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few beard shampoo&#x27;s to date and Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s has worked the best so far.</li>
            <li> He used to get compliments before, but now he gets them far more</li>
            <li> Next to deodorant, this is the most important product in my bathroom...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really convinced a beard shampoo is necessary, but this was an awesome product.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it feels so good on my face that I want to use it too fast</li>
            <li> Well worth it to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for that freshly shampooed feeling, not the almost dry/tacky feeling you get when using soap...</li>
            <li> Well first off I&#x27;m new to the beard thing,been growing mine for 6 months or so,I tried the same brand fuzzworthy for the beard care and gloss first,thought it was great</li>
            <li> I run it my across my beard in the shower and just a little bit suds up very nicely.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and my son really likes it!</li>
            <li> I just wet my beard, rub the bar across it a few times, and then work the rich lather in for an excellent clean.</li>
            <li> His beard is far more contained and generally looks a lot better after use.</li>
            <li> Cleans my scruffy beard right and smells manly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans my beard very well and you can tell when its clean.</li>
            <li> It smells really earthy and spicy but doesn&#x27;t linger long afterwards, which is good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard clean and ready for after shower treatments (either oil or balm).  </li>
            <li> He has been growing out his beard for a while and has tried different products to make the appearance more full as opposed to scraggly and for a softer touch.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to strong scents, etc</li>
            <li> Soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It lathers with just a tiny amount into a huge white foam and is basically scentless which is good too.</li>
            <li> Great lather with a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I certainly think that it&#x27;s doing a great job of cleaning my my beard with ought being too harsh.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, and you get a big chunk that&#x27;ll last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Helps with the dry and unruly hairs, and the scent works nicely.  </li>
            <li> With a quick google search, I realized there was a whole world of beard products that I had never known about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make hair super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The key to having a good beard, that isn&#x27;t wild and itchy, is using a shampoo that&#x27;s made for beards.....and not washing it every night.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product again a week ago, and I am writing this review now, with a very clear and smooth face.</li>
            <li> Wet your beard, slide this over the top of your whiskers two or three times and then lather up!</li>
            <li> We received this way faster than expected and love the product!</li>
            <li> No itching or dandruff, Very Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it once a week right now and am excited with how soft my beard has become.</li>
            <li> I now only use this soap along with a good beard balm, as it did get rid of the dry skin and beard dandruff that was caused by my original method of care (shampoo and conditioner) .</li>
            <li> Overall we are pleased with this product and will continue buying it and recommend it to our friends.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had always stuck to the bottled stuff that&#x27;s more like traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know nothing about washing hair, you&#x27;ve been bald for 20 years, you&#x27;re washing it too much!</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, I wake up with a nice, in-control, roughly 3-4&amp;#34; beard.</li>
            <li> The first cube lasted him about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that I really do like this product and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo &amp; so does my beard!</li>
            <li> His whatever that is on his face got soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would lather well and do a better job than regular shampoo...something that was made for beards, ya know?  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that where I leave it seems to degrade it more than my actual use.  </li>
            <li> When my boyfriend tried the shampoo for the first time, I almost wrecked my car because I touched his cheek.</li>
            <li> This beard gloss shampoo is pretty</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> My beard is much easier to comb and style and the number of ingrown hairs has plunged to zero!  </li>
            <li> First beard shampoo I ever bought and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> Love the small of this stuff and makes my beard feel really healthy.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a different condition that is working out much better.</li>
            <li> anyway my hubby raves about it and says he wished he had this from the beginning a facial hair growth :)</li>
            <li> They sport some pretty badass whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got a bit of chin hair and keep the top quite short</li>
            <li> My beard is not only softer but also more manageable, so it did as it said it would.  </li>
            <li> I will by more in the future when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the first time today and this product really works well!</li>
            <li> I use this product a few times a week and am getting reasonably good life out of the bar.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to keep my beard fluffy and smelling good</li>
            <li> It produces a great, thick lather and when I rinse it out my beard and mustache feel incredibly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Great lather after only minimal application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid block of shampoo not liquid, but it has a great lather once you wet it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves the beard feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My beard is so soft,  nourished and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Left my beard super clean.</li>
            <li> After more than a month, it really doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s gotten much smaller.</li>
            <li> It makes my boyfriends beard really soft and he loves it and it has a nice smell to it definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very cool and different.</li>
            <li> I had been trying a little bit of everything to keep my beard clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It really has left my beard feeling much softer and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Cleans my beard and leaves it full and soft.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the bar will last a good long time</li>
            <li> A bottle of shampoo and conditioner together cost more than a single brick of this manly product.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t dislike this product</li>
            <li> THE SOAP COMES IN A LARGE CUBE.  </li>
            <li> so he would always shave it off at a certain point.</li>
            <li> Second, the smell is interesting - not bad per se but definitely earthy smelling...</li>
            <li> Has great lather and has done wonders to make my beard feel soft and straighten some of my curlier hairs and has cut down on the amount of beard oil I have had to apply since this helps my beard grow uniformly and have a bit of natural shine.</li>
            <li> It comes cube shape, it has a woodsy and a tea tree kind a like smell, it makes a lot of lather with just a little amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel very soft afterward!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my future son-in-law and he said it made a huge difference in the feel of his beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lathers up really really well.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;m really growing it out (to the point where I have to trim with shears instead of an electric trimmer</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun idea to buy an old school product</li>
            <li> I get the sense this product is marketed toward modern day hipsters (no offense</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It makes the beard much softer.</li>
            <li> and he said that his beard is no longer itchy and is much softer.</li>
            <li> and you really feel like a man scrubbing your beard with a block of man soap instead of using your wife&#x27;s herbal essence shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest (and I have to my friends) to buy this for the bearded guy (or gal) in your life!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> He is very picky when it comes to what he uses on his beard.  </li>
            <li> It has a real manly smell.</li>
            <li> stern yet gentle beard care</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve missed the part where it&#x27;s really just a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anyone that disagrees should really give it another go.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo bar isn&#x27;t really so much of a bar as it is a cube.</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and has helped shine up my beard.</li>
            <li> I never thought a beard shampoo can make so much difference.</li>
            <li> The soap comes as a cube, so I took the liberty of buying a travel soap dish and cutting the bar into fourths, which works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Didnt understand how to really use it, should have come with instructions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to come straight out and say it.</li>
            <li> YES it is a very Earthy / Wood Scent.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well, cleans very well and leaves beard feeling softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will get all the dirt and old wax and nonsense out, so you have a fresh beard to start the day with.</li>
            <li> cleans and protects with lovely essential oils that leave my beard soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> He had previously used another product (whose name I cannot recall) but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it as it smelled very strongly of bread.</li>
            <li> WoW!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I just rub the bar in a beard a few circles and it suds right up.</li>
            <li> Really works well; left my beard clean and shine</li>
            <li> i also use the amish soap and these both clean the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found shampoos as basic as Johnson&#x27;s Baby makes it feel clean and healthy/shiny.</li>
            <li> I also expect that it will last quite some time as it doesn&#x27;t take much to come to a full lather.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using just shampoo and a good quality conditioner on a daily basis to keep my beard from being the Brillo pad/ wire brush constancy</li>
            <li> (I just pick up the cube and rub it across my beard a few times, then lather), smells nice and natural, and really leaves the hair feeling &amp;#34;conditionally</li>
            <li> I literally gasped at how soft his beard was after the FIRST shampooing.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box I was surprised that the bar of soap was brown and square in shape.</li>
            <li> it does get a good lather in the beard, but I did not notice an actual difference between using this and using regular soap or facial wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little unusual, and the &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; description sounds appropriate.  </li>
            <li> My husband is new to beard care products, but loves this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I use it three times per week in combination with a nice beard oil and have seen a dramatic improvement in my beard, both in softness and in overall \\&quot;health\\&quot; (not as many wiry, prickly ends).  </li>
            <li> I really like how soft this makes my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, and he really likes how moisturizing his skin underneath feels.</li>
            <li> and I have tried my fair share of beard products over the last few years.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t try everything at once, but this is a decent place to start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a serious &#x27;beardsman&#x27;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> If you want your beard to be both daunting and voluptuous, I highly suggest this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I understand why this stuff is so highly rated now.</li>
            <li> I highly advise you to grab a cube of this, slap it on your face and start feeling and looking like a man again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend HIGHLY</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> IT WILL NOT make your beard shine like your super dope wheels on your 90&#x27;s Honda, but will be shinier than the flat paint or powder coat on your fixie bike.</li>
            <li> I have a very long beard and this shampoo keeps it under control as well as keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> As far as &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t really say,</li>
            <li> The soap seems to get soft fast.</li>
            <li> As my beard got longer it started to get a lot more dried out and wirey,</li>
            <li> I have a full, fairly long beard</li>
            <li> I use beard balm every day and it sometimes doesn&#x27;t wash out with normal water.</li>
            <li> I have been growing my beard for the past 6 months, which I believe is the longest it&#x27;s ever been (nothing impressive, but quite thick).  </li>
            <li> This is a really good shampoo for your beard cleans well only gripe I have about the product I&#x27;m not really into the smell to earthy and hippyish for me but use on my beats daily</li>
            <li> it normally is.</li>
            <li> You want to keep your facial hair fresh.  </li>
            <li> Next day after those shampoos, the beard is okay, but it&#x27;s feeling dry.</li>
            <li> bought this one month ago, and there&#x27;s still enough to last me easily another month, maybe two.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend whom has a very long, full beard.</li>
            <li> Builds a rich lather with minimal usage of the bar.</li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;see instant results&amp;#34; product, but it&#x27;s a great addition to a simple regimen to keep your beard soft and tame (or untamed if that&#x27;s your thing).  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can think, is that it may help dull the points of the hair, which would be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s is gentle enough to use every day and effective enough to use every other day, depending on how my day went.  </li>
            <li> , I guess I&#x27;d expected something more like regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard very soft and maintains softness between washes - which occur about every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li> The scent is very natural smelling</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that it was a bar or rather a cube of soap.</li>
            <li> The bar is very dense and long lasting - just a couple of swipes across my wet beard and it soaps up nicely.</li>
            <li> But I just got out of the shower and wow its soft and a ton of color showed up that I did not Know was there !!</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used beard specific products.</li>
            <li> Have been using for the past week and am really glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard specific product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that has cured that.</li>
            <li> Keeps your beard healthy or maybe that&#x27;s just me, not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular shampoos and products specifically for beards but nothing left my beard feeling this clean.  </li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week to really deep clean my beard, and this soap does the trick.</li>
            <li> Huge block of soap, that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> just ordered my second bar, even though my first is still half full.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to get away from using my normal shampoo, which dried out my beard and mustache significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried growing a beard for ages only to shave it off largely cause of the itching and dandruff</li>
            <li> Should definitely store in a small tupperware or similar to increase the life, particularly if your shower is not just your own.</li>
            <li> and it has become wild and untamed.  </li>
            <li> By using this shampoo it leaves it soft and gives me the ability to comb through and set it the way I want it to.  </li>
            <li> it makes my beard so soft that my fiance even enjoys it.</li>
            <li> She immediately wrinkled her nose said &amp;#34;It smells like an old ashtray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I am an old school hipster myself).</li>
            <li> It lathers up really well, so the bar should last a while.</li>
            <li> With your products, he now has a soft, touchable beard.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> So soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO HAVE KEPT MY BEARD SOFTER, NOT BABY SOFT</li>
            <li> I use it on my young beard.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised when this came</li>
            <li> If I leave it in the shower it gets soft and dissolves quicker like any soap bar would.</li>
            <li> And The Wife Digs How Soft It Is.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and no stinky smell in my mustache area.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It resides on a shower caddy under my showerhead, and while the water doesn&#x27;t drip onto it directly, I&#x27;m sure it catches some splashes at least.  </li>
            <li> I have had a beard of varied thickness for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The receiver of this gift was pleasantly surprised by the smell of this item.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really buy any regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Completely eliminates &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Beard is soft and manageable and paired with the wax/conditioner, it is looking like I want it to look.  </li>
            <li> I apply this to my beard in the shower, and when it lathers up the beard is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried different types of soaps but this one really cleans your beard and keeps your skin moisturized .</li>
            <li> It leaves his beard soft.  </li>
            <li> I imagine someone with a thick beard would benefit from it most.</li>
            <li> The soap cleans my beard and &#x27;stache well, but the lather is thick and takes a bit more time and effort to rinse out.</li>
            <li> A little bit creates a really rich lather.</li>
            <li> I first received the product, it was actually a lot smaller than I assumed it would be, maybe 2&amp;#34; cubed, but I have been using for about a month and don&#x27;t feel I will need to reorder for about 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> My full and soft beard is now fuller, softer and oh so fluffy.</li>
            <li> Now just a little works and it help with the dry skin under the hair way better and faster than oils added after the shower.</li>
            <li> Basically I drag it down each side and across my chin, and get more lather than I could ever need.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and will be purchasing again when necessary.</li>
            <li> personally cannot keep a beard without a product like this, and I look like I&#x27;m in high school without one.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m new to the beard thing, and normally shave it when it gets too long.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - wet your beard and wet the soap.</li>
            <li> I think a fair price should be at least half for what it sells for.</li>
            <li> No more lady soap just to get a smooth looking</li>
            <li> only complaint, is I wish this conditioned the beard a bit more.</li>
            <li> First soap that actually works for long beards.</li>
            <li> This bar format reduces wasted product and is cheap enough to use every day (like it should be)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hypothesized to myself (and now you) that this is partly due to the cube having a higher volume to surface area ratio than a longer, flatter bar.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit drying on my husband beard, may just be because of his type of facial hairs that are pretty dry to start with.</li>
            <li> The soap bar was somewhat large, compared to what I expected.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I started using this daily every time I showered and it fixed my beard dandruff and any leftover dirt and garbage in it.</li>
            <li> The masculine scent of eucalyptus and testosterone assaulted my nostrils like a tiny team of bearded lumberjacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can barely tell that it&#x27;s even been used.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard soft and manageable and i am constantly getting complimented on my beard.</li>
            <li> He says it makes his beard soft and manageable, and his skin is not irritated as with regular soaps and shampoos.</li>
            <li> So far, i&#x27;ve used it daily with no complaints.</li>
            <li> The only product that leaves my beard soft after washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get a lot of use as I have a long beard and the bar is pretty small , but in two week of everyday use it seems like it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It dries out and can become a hot mess if you don&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
            <li> ,the fuzz products compliment each other very well,I&#x27;m growing my beard and I will try competing some day.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much time and money!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the boyfriend, and he brags about it the way a 12 year old girl would brag about meeting Justin Bieber (that must mean he loves it, right?)</li>
            <li> So after reading the mixed reviews on this product I have come to the conclusion, that some people expect miraculous change overnight or after a single use from a bar of soap (because they aren&#x27;t realistic enough to realize its just soap, or that they lack a brain) .</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a cube with hard edges) but lathers quickly</li>
            <li> There can be a bit of a tingling on dry or sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative that I found to this block that will likely last me at least 2 months is the $12 price point, But that&#x27;s for you to decide if a product that can replace two others and keep your beard clean is worth it...</li>
            <li> Rinses cleanly (not greasy/oily) and leaves a nice fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> , the block of soap is pretty substantial for my use, and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> Wife cut down the complaints about scratchy whiskers within those first two days, and it also seems to be moisturizing the skin under my beard, because that feels better, less dry, less tight.</li>
            <li> He uses it every other day in the shower and his beard is much softer and he scratches it far less often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t stick around, which isn&#x27;t really a good or bad thing.</li>
            <li> Got my d!@# stuck in a vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for beardsmen with allergies to colognes and heavy scents.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get a thick lather</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve got a pretty mean looking set of whiskers myself and I can&#x27;t believe I used to use just regular ol&#x27; shampoo and conditioner on my man parts - my whiskers.</li>
            <li> AND HAVE ONLY BURNED THROUGH HALF OF IT SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Will only soften your beard for about five minutes, then it&#x27;ll go back to being all frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> My beard was starting to feel dry and look unruly, despite my using my regular shampoo and conditioner on it, and I needed to do something.  </li>
            <li> I like to call myself a hipster dad who grows his annual winter beard but this product fell flat in terms of performance.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos make it soft but softness fizzled out after a few hours and beard returned to its natural manly toughness (both shampoos specific for beards and whatever fancy shampoo my lady has).</li>
            <li> I’m not sure what’s in this stuff, but my beard, which normally feels like a rough Brillo pad, is now soft and a lot easier to groom.  </li>
            <li> I came across this little bad boy and saw it had great reviews, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Can also be use to wash your entire head area - will not over dry skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I use it, dry it with the towel and put it back in the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The block of this is much larger than i had expected, i think it will last a year.</li>
            <li> Also, I was curious what to do with a square cube of shampoo, but I&#x27;ve had this thing for several months and it never seems to get any smaller!</li>
            <li> a single use it tamed my unruly jaw mane making me the envy of fierce badgers and urban beavers across the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,I then ordered the same fuzzworthy brand shampoo soap bar/block,follow the directions,it&#x27;s real natural soap type texture, it has a trippy smell at first,wash beard well lathered in shower using the beard shampoo,wait for beard to dry then scrape a small amount of the beard care gloss with your finger nail and rub it to together,massage into your skin under the beard and around, then get out the comb and take your time combing through beard</li>
            <li> After receiving this item I was a little surprised.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s soap that comes in a hard block that you need to get wet and lather.</li>
            <li> I WILL be buying again when this runs out, which will probably be a long time from now.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I only use it a few times a week, so if you plan on using it daily it may not last as long for you.  </li>
            <li> I expected the shampoo to take a while to soften his facial hair</li>
            <li> As long as you have some sort of conditioner or leave in balm to put in afterwards, you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake botox injected catfish looking women don&#x27;t like beards or hair in general,my beard is all real no fake extensions.men stop being p-whipped and grow a beard, it&#x27;s free,so take your freedom back!real</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhere between sandalwood and bay rum, though it doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who was suffering from a dry and itchy beard.</li>
            <li> , this made my skin really dry</li>
            <li> For now I just remove it from the shower when I exit it and store the bar on a dry dish.</li>
            <li> Rinse well after use, dry then use  Professor Fuzzworth&#x27;y  Beard Care Gloss as a followup.</li>
            <li> Keep the bar dry when not in use.</li>
            <li> Afterwards let it dry and follow up with beard oil.</li>
            <li> In fact I use the lather to shape up my beard on my neck with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well without leaving a dry brittle beard.</li>
            <li> a single use my beard was relaxed, soothed, and pampered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small square chunk but suds quickly and thickly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product--incredibly gentle and lathers up like crazy, even in the hard water we have here at our residence.  </li>
            <li> A little will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> SO WITH REGULAR USE MAYBE A CUBE EVERY MONTH AND A HALF OR SO.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting mine in half so that it was easier to use and more convenient to store.</li>
            <li> I was using regular shampoo and conditioner every few days and my 3 month beard was brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> (The manufacturer is correct about needing only a little of the product.)</li>
            <li> The picture gives the impression that the bar of soap is larger than it is and when we took it out of the box, It was a little square bar of soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Block was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> There are way to many factors to say this is a cure all for all that is bad about your beard.</li>
            <li> Not necessary to use it everyday</li>
            <li> Wet your face, slide the block of shampoo over it one time.</li>
            <li> Wet your hands again and start massaging, lathering it.</li>
            <li> I was having a really crummy time growing my beard, to make matters worse</li>
            <li> This product destroyed the wet dog stink and flaking without making my face smell like a field of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just rub it across your wet beard once or twice from ear to ear ...</li>
            <li> I have zero regrets.  </li>
            <li> However, I quite like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to remain after rinsing, so it&#x27;s really not an issue either way.  </li>
            <li> Then I expected the softness to plateau, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> He has a used a few and this is the only one he has asked me to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It also never really conditioned my mans beard the way we thought it would.</li>
            <li> Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations.</li>
            <li> I wash it out, by beard feels rough -- but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Its lasted me a few months already and still has plenty of life left in it.</li>
            <li> I just get it wet and rub it around on m beard.</li>
            <li> Thick, soft, manageable.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed in the size of the bar, but after using it for the first time I realized how concentrated the shampoo is.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried that using a bar on my face would be weird, but it&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus points: A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I tried it out in shower and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I store mine in the shower high on the shelf to prevent unnecessary water wearing away at it.</li>
            <li> , I wash with it every other day.</li>
            <li> normal shampoos and conditioners just seemed to make it worse</li>
            <li> If you cut off small pieces at a time and use it that way, it should last months.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and plan to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Lasts a lot longer than some of the other soaps out there.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me and I will continue to recommend this to other friends.</li>
            <li> soap comes in a small cube but with a beard comes wisdom so don&#x27;t be fooled by outside appearances.</li>
            <li> While I was disappointed there is no storage container, I was able to store it in my shaving bowl which I use to lather up my shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar is in the sz of a small cube, could be bigger</li>
            <li> Now my students no longer confuse me with other students.</li>
            <li> It is small, but when used correctly will last.</li>
            <li> I live in Bakersfield and to make matters worse</li>
            <li> I was using shampoos to wash my beard and they always gave it a crispy dry feeling after it dried out.</li>
            <li> Had it three months and can hardly even tell the block has gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li> Should last me for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> Until about two years ago, I was a heavy smoker and as soon as I got this wet</li>
            <li> shape is akward with harsh corners and really not something you want to rub on your face and or in your beard.</li>
            <li> I was coming down with the gnarliest case of beard dandruff in the history of humanity.</li>
            <li> Unless the price goes down to .25 cents</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week (along with some other beard care products), and I can already tell a difference in my beard..</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo also adds some shine and health to my beard compared to previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used as well.</li>
            <li> I imagine it will last at least a few months.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hurt the ladies and less itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought other liquid beard shampoos, but they don&#x27;t last very long and can get very expensive for daily use.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected.</li>
            <li> Scent takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> This little square cube of heaven lives up to the reputation forecasted by it&#x27;s reviewers.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of lather that comes off that little cube.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the shampoo bar takes the shape of the grate it rests on, so I know I&#x27;m losing a little bit of longevity out of it from my placement.  </li>
            <li> This little cube contains all of the oils/conditioning products I used to use</li>
            <li> I use it usually once every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND USE IT ALONG WITH MY MORNING AND EVENING ROUTINES.  </li>
            <li> The secret is moderation, use only what works.</li>
            <li> Use to use everyday shampoo and conditioner and it dried out my skin and beard.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days the itching and dandruff are gone.</li>
            <li> I massage it into the beard and leave it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use everyday as I feel there is no need to shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> and he says his face is less itchy!</li>
            <li> While the dimensions might make you think it&#x27;s very small, it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a &#x27;fun&#x27; gift for a friend and his crazy beard -- he ended up using it and loves it!</li>
            <li> It makes my very stiff and kinky beard loosen up and relax a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest anyone working on (or maintaining) their beard to only use this bad boy once a week and supplement it with beard oils and the occasional conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vikings, Paul Bunyan, Chuck Norris, heavy metal bands the world over, some women, and YOU!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive/good to let any go to waste!</li>
            <li> Only con is the awkward square shaped bar, but even that can be overlooked</li>
            <li> They all have one thing in common -</li>
            <li> No more itching!</li>
            <li> Support small business!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s simply not worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small cube of product.</li>
            <li> Dudes seriously, get this soap.  </li>
            <li> Does your weak chin cry out for follicle support?</li>
            <li> but my use has definitely decreased with use of this</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation with either product.</li>
            <li> I put it in a Ziploc baggie in my shampoo rack when not using to keep it from melting away unnecessarily when not in use.</li>
            <li> My wife complained I was stabbing her when we kiss</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the reports that you shouldn&#x27;t use hair shampoo on your beard, I&#x27;d done it for years and had never experienced any issues.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than an out of control beard!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
            <li> I started off on the wrong foot.</li>

            <li> Do you yearn for an organic face sweater on those cold days?</li>
            <li> and this is all ill use now!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> See my post on beard care gloss.</li>
            <li> My beard looks good, smells good and stays in place.</li>
            <li> This is great product, I&#x27;ve been growing my beard since Dec 1st and it has become wild and untamed.  By using this shampoo it leaves it soft and gives me the ability to comb through and set it the way I want it to.  It sits there for the remainder of the day.  It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I just rub the bar in a beard a few circles and it suds right up. it makes my beard so soft that my fiance even enjoys it. It did not however make me look like Professor Fuzzworthy, which was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME cube, leaves my whiskers nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great and keeps beard soft as well as conditioning the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for me beard it smells nice and a bearded mans scent. Keeps my beard soft and clean. I dig</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have tried many types of beard wash and shampoo but this is by far the best soap available. If you have a beard buy this soap.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft and it smells great! The only beard shampoo he will use now!</li>
            <li> Cleans my scruffy beard right and smells manly.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up really really well.</li>
            <li> Scent takes a little getting used to. Definitely helped with beard itch and flaking. I also combined it with a regular butter and oil treatment. I like it!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have a beard of similar length to the cartoon guy in the product picture. The soap works great and my beard is definitely softer. Unfortunately, the soap smells terrible. Until about two years ago, I was a heavy smoker and as soon as I got this wet it reminded me of how my clothes used to smell at the end of the day. I thought I was imagining it and had my wife smell it. She immediately wrinkled her nose said &amp;#34;It smells like an old ashtray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly torn. The product works great, but the smell is horrendous. On one hand, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger much after washing and any beard wax/cream will easily cover it. On the other hand, rubbing an ashtray into my face first thing in the morning is incredibly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - 5 star product with a 1 star smell. I&#x27;m only taking off one star since the smell doesn&#x27;t hang around.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the reports that you shouldn&#x27;t use hair shampoo on your beard, I&#x27;d done it for years and had never experienced any issues. But now that I&#x27;m really growing it out (to the point where I have to trim with shears instead of an electric trimmer I thought I should take extra care in my beards care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after reading up a bit I decided to try Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Shampoo. I am really glad I did, after just one use my beard is softer than it has ever been. It&#x27;s a bit more manageable as well. The bar is a bit to get use to (it&#x27;s a cube with hard edges) but lathers quickly and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like it says there is a woodsy sent, perhaps including a touch of sandalwood? I wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t quite as strong. It overpowers the lighter sent of my beard oil. Otherwise it would get a five.</li>
            <li> Okay I must be a sucker because I bought into their marketing and some of the great reviews. I certainly don&#x27;t dislike this product but it&#x27;s simply not worth the expensive price. Their writeup makes it sound likes it does wonders. Well it does not. It&#x27;s a fun idea to buy an old school product but that is just about it. I think a fair price should be at least half for what it sells for. Maybe around $4-7. I get the sense this product is marketed toward modern day hipsters (no offense - I am an old school hipster myself). I like to call myself a hipster dad who grows his annual winter beard but this product fell flat in terms of performance. Save your money and use a good quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This beard shampoo is amazing! I run it my across my beard in the shower and just a little bit suds up very nicely. It&#x27;s easy to rub into my beard and rinses out well. It really has left my beard feeling much softer and looking healthy. The best thing this shampoo has done for me is get rid of the dry skin under my beard. No more itching! I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Works great my beard is clean and shiny. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I have a very long beard and this shampoo keeps it under control as well as keeping my face clean. I absolutely love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my boyfriend and he loves it! This product works great and keeps his beard shiny and soft. The only reason we didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because he found it works best with a leave in conditioner rather than on its own. We will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Makes me smell like an Australian dandy lumberjack. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> as ordered.  would order again</li>
            <li> Really works well; left my beard clean and shine</li>
            <li> Great product! It cleans my beard very well and you can tell when its clean.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that it is a bar of soap rather than a splurge liquid.  It has a great smell and it definitely helps.  I use it because my face tends to flake when I grow out my luscious beard.  Helps combat that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who was suffering from a dry and itchy beard. He had previously used another product (whose name I cannot recall) but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it as it smelled very strongly of bread. I ordered this and the conditioner and my husband is pleased with the result. The smell is light and pleasant, and we both enjoy it. He uses it every other day in the shower and his beard is much softer and he scratches it far less often. His beard is far more contained and generally looks a lot better after use. Overall we are pleased with this product and will continue buying it and recommend it to our friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my future son-in-law and he said it made a huge difference in the feel of his beard. Said it made it silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> Best beard shampoo I have found!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great. It makes the beard much softer. It lathers up really well, so the bar should last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. What more should be said?</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! Really lathers up nicely. Makes his beard much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT beard soap. Not necessary to use it everyday but it doesn&#x27;t hurt the condition of your beard if you do. Leaves it feeling very soft and manageable. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good lather - excellent product!</li>
            <li> My husband used to have a beard like a rabid marmont. With your products, he now has a soft, touchable beard.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted. Makes my beard soft and easier to comb. Great product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I love this!!!! His beard feels and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I had never used a beard wash bar before this product. I had always stuck to the bottled stuff that&#x27;s more like traditional shampoo. I was hesitant about making the switch, but I&#x27;m glad I did. This stuff smells great, and you get a big chunk that&#x27;ll last quite some time. I just wet my beard, rub the bar across it a few times, and then work the rich lather in for an excellent clean.</li>
            <li> Great soap! this stuff smells amazing. i also use the amish soap and these both clean the same. this has a manly smell i think fits more men, the amish soap has a more natural smell....just get both and switch them up, that&#x27;s what i do.&lt;br /&gt;The block of this is much larger than i had expected, i think it will last a year.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard soap. He uses it in the shower daily and he said that his beard is no longer itchy and is much softer. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, feels good.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft this makes my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, and he really likes how moisturizing his skin underneath feels.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li> As the 5 stars indicate I am loving this product!  It produces a great, thick lather and when I rinse it out my beard and mustache feel incredibly clean and soft.  This is a must have for anyone, man or woman, with a beard!!</li>
            <li> My goodness Professor Fuzzworthy, what have you done to me and my beard? I had been trying a little bit of everything to keep my beard clean and healthy. Those Argan shampoos work pretty good as do the conditioners. I&#x27;ve even found shampoos as basic as Johnson&#x27;s Baby makes it feel clean and healthy/shiny. It doesn&#x27;t last very long. Next day after those shampoos, the beard is okay, but it&#x27;s feeling dry. The following day I wake up and look like an afro formed on my face. I&#x27;ve heard different advices about &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t know nothing about washing hair, you&#x27;ve been bald for 20 years, you&#x27;re washing it too much! That&#x27;s drying it out.&amp;#34; Possibly, but how else do you expect me to get the sandblast and dirt out of it from work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s shampoo. I&#x27;ve used a product similar to this on my skin. While the dimensions might make you think it&#x27;s very small, it&#x27;s really not. It&#x27;s a nice sized block of it and it&#x27;s made in the perfect shape to use sparingly. Since I have some experience with this type of soap, this is what you do: Wet your face, slide the block of shampoo over it one time. Stop. Wet your hands again and start massaging, lathering it. It&#x27;s as easy as that. Lather will be going everywhere. I expect to get about 2-3 months use out of each block of it. The smell is somewhere between sandalwood and bay rum, though it doesn&#x27;t stay very long. I don&#x27;t even smell it once out of the shower. With this shampoo, I wake up with a nice, in-control, roughly 3-4&amp;#34; beard. It has a gleam or maybe it&#x27;s a glow to it. My wife and daughter love touching the freshly washed beard. They say the texture is similar to our puppy&#x27;s hair. So soft and shiny. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> fabulous!  I like grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap a lot, but this is far superior!  cleans and protects with lovely essential oils that leave my beard soft and luxurious.  my girl loves the feel of my beard on her face and her.... well you get the idea.  my beard salutes you professor!</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used beard specific products. Could tell a difference in the feel of my beard after just one use. Beard is softer feeling and easier to comb. Recommending it to my fuzzy faced friends!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for beards... My wife complained I was stabbing her when we kiss and that is no longer the case. Thanks for saving my beard!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for the past week and am really glad I got it. Lathers up great and you really feel like a man scrubbing your beard with a block of man soap instead of using your wife&#x27;s herbal essence shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and my son really likes it!</li>
            <li> This is the first beard specific product I have tried. I the past I have used regular shampoo and conditioner with fairly good results. This product worked not only kept my beard soft and tangle free, but kept my skin under the beard in great shape, no drying of flaking. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> The bar wasn&#x27;t as good as shampoo bottles</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leavesbeard soft, I wash with it every other day. Good smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  As my beard got longer it started to get a lot more dried out and wirey, normal shampoos and conditioners just seemed to make it worse but this stuff works great!  Works best when paired with a purpose made beard conditioner and some beard oil.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it!! Going back to get the rest of the products in this line.</li>
            <li> The BEST beard shampoo I have used. Has great lather and has done wonders to make my beard feel soft and straighten some of my curlier hairs and has cut down on the amount of beard oil I have had to apply since this helps my beard grow uniformly and have a bit of natural shine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I would highly suggest (and I have to my friends) to buy this for the bearded guy (or gal) in your life!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is really into his beard and he loved this product. I got it for him as a stocking stuffer and he uses it to wash his hair now as well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  He&#x27;s found it makes his beard softer and much more manageable.  He also likes the smell.  This was our second order.  The first cube lasted him about 3 months.  He uses it daily in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was having a really crummy time growing my beard, to make matters worse I was coming down with the gnarliest case of beard dandruff in the history of humanity. I live in Bakersfield and to make matters worse I work out a lot, this made my skin really dry and my beard really dirty. I started using this daily every time I showered and it fixed my beard dandruff and any leftover dirt and garbage in it. This product is marvelous, lasts for a very long time. The smell is nothing bad, but its also nothing to write home about. If you are suffering from beard dandruff give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week as I read online to do. Works great!</li>
            <li> A must buy for beard grooming</li>
            <li> Smells like a forest of pine and ruggedness when lathering during shower but is not overpowering afterwards. I use a beard balm and a beard oil afterwards so the smell of the shampoo is at it highest during the shower. It makes my beard very soft and maintains softness between washes - which occur about every 2 days or so. Other shampoos make it soft but softness fizzled out after a few hours and beard returned to its natural manly toughness (both shampoos specific for beards and whatever fancy shampoo my lady has). I prefer the softness. This shampoo also adds some shine and health to my beard compared to previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used as well. But I also take a healthy dose of fish oil pills to assist with beard health.</li>
            <li> This product destroyed the wet dog stink and flaking without making my face smell like a field of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a sweltering heat that causes my beard to trap constant sweat and a lot of acrid burnt metal smoke.  Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s is gentle enough to use every day and effective enough to use every other day, depending on how my day went.  Plus the bar seems to last FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Me and my man both love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Left my beard super clean. And has a very unique, but good smell to it. It&#x27;s a small square chunk but suds quickly and thickly. Lol</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I bought it about 4 or 5 months ago and am just running out now, and I use it 3-4 times a week, for my beard and hair. It smells really earthy and spicy but doesn&#x27;t linger long afterwards, which is good. If you cut off small pieces at a time and use it that way, it should last months. Purchasing more right now.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wonderful service. I will absolutely be a repeat customer. Support small business!</li>
            <li> This soap is great. Smell good and it make the difference. Since I  begin to use it  my beard look perfect.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I decided to purchase for my husband.  I am very sensitive to strong scents, etc so I was somewhat worrisome.  However, the scent was not overbearing as some had described.  It has a very earthy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  His beard is his pride and joy.  He is very picky when it comes to what he uses on his beard.  My husband loves it and I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Huge block of soap, that will last a long time.  Smells good, lathers well. Just rub in your palms and lather up. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> simple cube of quality stuff.  smells great, feels great. it looks a bit diminutive, but this joker will last for months.</li>
            <li> Best ever glad I tried it very happy will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Feels a bit drying on my husband beard, may just be because of his type of facial hairs that are pretty dry to start with.</li>
            <li> This beard shampoo bar is FANTASTIC. Feels great on my skin and the smell is a piney fresh fragrance. I highly recommend this, and will be purchasing again when necessary. Thank you!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed in the size of the bar, but after using it for the first time I realized how concentrated the shampoo is.  Anyway I love the product.  It produces a ton of lather and smells awesome.  It has a real manly smell. I hate men’s products that smell flowery or like powder.  I’m not sure what’s in this stuff, but my beard, which normally feels like a rough Brillo pad, is now soft and a lot easier to groom.  I use it every day and plan to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not a night-and-day difference, Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Shampoo definitely leaves my beard softer than regular soap or shampoo. It has a pleasant, earthy/woodsy smell to it, which is nice considering it comes about as close to your nose as possible. It lathers up well and rinses easily. There can be a bit of a tingling on dry or sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the cube-shaped package. After more than a month, it really doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s gotten much smaller. I&#x27;ve hypothesized to myself (and now you) that this is partly due to the cube having a higher volume to surface area ratio than a longer, flatter bar. Or it might just be that you don&#x27;t need to use very much for a full lather. I prefer the former, because, you know, science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever get through this block, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard clean and soft smells good and a little goes a long way. Lasts a lot longer than some of the other soaps out there.</li>
            <li> WoW!!! This stuff is crazy nice. I&#x27;ve even wrote about it on a couple of beard forums I belong to. The stuff is amazing and HIGHLY  concentrated. Just rub it across your wet beard once or twice from ear to ear ... that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Easy to use, and smells great.  Leaves my beard clean and ready for after shower treatments (either oil or balm).  I use this product a few times a week and am getting reasonably good life out of the bar.  Should definitely store in a small tupperware or similar to increase the life, particularly if your shower is not just your own.</li>
            <li> I received this product as gift, and I love it! It makes my very stiff and kinky beard loosen up and relax a little. I even like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Do you someday dream of having a beard to make Jack London blush? Do you yearn for an organic face sweater on those cold days? Does your weak chin cry out for follicle support? If you answered yes to any of the above, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a single use it tamed my unruly jaw mane making me the envy of fierce badgers and urban beavers across the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a single use my beard was relaxed, soothed, and pampered. The masculine scent of eucalyptus and testosterone assaulted my nostrils like a tiny team of bearded lumberjacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you experience Professor Fuzzyworths stern yet gentle beard care, you&#x27;ll be a student for life.</li>
            <li> I have a full, fairly long beard and I have tried my fair share of beard products over the last few years. I can honestly say this is one of the finest products I have ever used. I bought it off the recommendation of a coworker and was not disappointment. First off it smells WONDERFUL. It cleans the beard hairs but leaves them moisturized. Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Amazing, beard get soft and smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve missed the part where it&#x27;s really just a bar of soap. It smells okay, but my husband&#x27;s beard isn&#x27;t any softer after using it. Not impressed, and won&#x27;t buy it again. We got some nicer stuff off Etsy before, but I was looking for something that would arrive in 2 days. I&#x27;ll head back to Etsy for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Works great. Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it...</li>
            <li> Bought this based off of reviews and ingredients. It smells great, and the best part is that it lathers up massively and quickly without having to use much. Really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t stick around, which isn&#x27;t really a good or bad thing. I use beard oil which would mask it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, is I wish this conditioned the beard a bit more. Overall, this is a great product and I will probably stick with it unless someone suggests another product that they feel makes their beard smoother than this.</li>
            <li> The item was as described , delivered on time ,quality is really good ,great packaging and i really satisfied about the all shipment,hope to have business together again</li>
            <li> My husband is using this in conjunction with Honest Amish Beard Balm and let me tell you, his beard is glorious. Thick, soft, manageable. After one use of this shampoo we noticed a difference. Kudos!</li>
            <li> I have very much so enjoyed Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Shampoo. It is excellent and helps me manage my ever growing beard. It&#x27;s smells fantastic and manly - anyone that disagrees should really give it another go. It&#x27;s not an overwhelming smell and so far has been enjoyed by everyone around me. I use it once a week right now and am excited with how soft my beard has become. This coupled with some beard oil, a nice brush and some trimming scissors makes any beard manageable.</li>
            <li> love this item. smells good and works well.</li>
            <li> Within two days my beard was noticeably softer. Smell is great, and not overpowering. Wife cut down the complaints about scratchy whiskers within those first two days, and it also seems to be moisturizing the skin under my beard, because that feels better, less dry, less tight. Will DEFINITELY be reordering as I run out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I had a beard and did not know about this wonderful product. I am now using this beard shampoo on a daily basis and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there to wash bears. Will last a loooong time...it lathers well andcsmells great</li>
            <li> Fantastic product--incredibly gentle and lathers up like crazy, even in the hard water we have here at our residence.  I use it twice a week, maybe more if I smoke a cigar and then follow it up with some good beard oil.  Will be a permanent part of my skin care regiment when I&#x27;m sporting facial hair.</li>
            <li> WOW. Ok, so I was a bit surprised to discover this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; actually resembles a cube of soap, but it really does a GREAT job on my beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use (I just pick up the cube and rub it across my beard a few times, then lather), smells nice and natural, and really leaves the hair feeling &amp;#34;conditionally clean&amp;#34;-- that is, clean and healthy, NOT DRIED OUT. I actually also use conditioner on my beard now and then, especially after I had used a &amp;#34;non-beard&amp;#34; shampoo product (because THOSE would leave my beard feeling as if it needed conditioning)-- but my use has definitely decreased with use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really seems to do a great job of cleaning (mostly removing balms and waxes), and leaves my beard refreshed, soft, and pleasant smelling (VERY mildly so). As far as &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t really say, but I can say that I really do like this product and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND USE IT ALONG WITH MY MORNING AND EVENING ROUTINES.  SMELLS NICE, NOT GIRLY BUT CLEAN SMELL.  IT SEEMS TO HAVE KEPT MY BEARD SOFTER, NOT BABY SOFT BUT MY WIFE CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE IN THAT ITS NOT LIKE STEEL WOOL.  THE SOAP COMES IN A LARGE CUBE.  I JUST WHIPPED MY EDC KNIFE AND HACKED IT INTO FOUR PIECES AND JUST PULL OUT A PIECE AT A TIME AND HAVE ONLY BURNED THROUGH HALF OF IT SO FAR. SO WITH REGULAR USE MAYBE A CUBE EVERY MONTH AND A HALF OR SO. REALLY GOOD PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER ANOTHER ONE SOON!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty small bar for the price, but my husband (who has a 10 + inch beard) likes it.  It does smell really good when he gets out of the shower. Hopefully the bar will last a good long time</li>
            <li> Lathers up extremely well, perfect for helping combat beard itch!</li>
            <li> This is our second order of the beard shampoo. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo &amp; so does my beard! Gets my beard clean, it&#x27;s leaves it soft and smells good (she like the smell too!)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  I use it on my young beard.  It&#x27;s kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> Use this every time I shower, makes your beard softer and conditions it to be in the best position for hair growth.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does what is advertised. Wish I had thought about it being in a bar, rather than in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I quite like this product and fully intend to purchase more when this bar runs out (which should take a while). I had never used a shampoo bar before and am quite liking how much more efficient it is than liquid shampoo. This goes in easy and has a nice &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation while it works. Afterwards my beard feels and looks much more sleek and is considerably easier to manage. 5/5 will be buying again.</li>
            <li> its been 1 week since I started using this product and the result is great, I only use this product at night, but it helps my beard look awesome!. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well. It comes in a cube, and is easy to use. Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and leaves the beard soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo hands down I have used on my beard.  I&#x27;ve used regular shampoos and products specifically for beards but nothing left my beard feeling this clean.  It lathers with just a tiny amount into a huge white foam and is basically scentless which is good too.</li>
            <li> Smells manly and tames my beard.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I only use it about once a week to really deep clean my beard, and this soap does the trick. I was using shampoos to wash my beard and they always gave it a crispy dry feeling after it dried out. This soap leaves the beard feeling clean but not dried out. This soap also has a nice manly scent, which is awesome. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the boyfriend, and he brags about it the way a 12 year old girl would brag about meeting Justin Bieber (that must mean he loves it, right?) It smells awesome, and I can&#x27;t simply can&#x27;t help myself from constantly running my hands through it. If you want your beard to be both daunting and voluptuous, I highly suggest this soap.</li>
            <li> OK-where do I start? My bf&#x27;s goatee/beard/whatever died on his face was like getting kissed by a porcupine. Forget touched by a rose. I would get scratched by porcupine needles. I told him he had to shave it off!  Thank Goodness for Professor Fuzzworthy! He made such a difference within just one use! I can&#x27;t believe how using this soap one time took away his beard dandruff-totally gross! I had no idea guy&#x27;s get this....ewWwEeeeewwwww! His whatever that is on his face got soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, any ladies out there who&#x27;s man has something scruffy that died on his face, get him this. You will thank me!</li>
            <li> Smells good, wish the sent  would last longer.</li>
            <li> It comes cube shape, it has a woodsy and a tea tree kind a like smell, it makes a lot of lather with just a little amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard hair used to fall a lot and it was crunchy kinda like, but after using the shampoo it started to improve, my beard is smooth, shiny and doesn&#x27;t fall off  like it used to.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised when this came and I found it was a solid block, I guess I&#x27;d expected something more like regular shampoo.  However once I tried it my concerns went away.  It lathers up great, cleans, smells good and leaves my beard looking great.  I also expect that it will last quite some time as it doesn&#x27;t take much to come to a full lather.</li>
            <li> I bought this and its companion Beard Gloss for my husband on a whim after a friend recommended it. My husband asked this morning if I&#x27;d please order more of both, since he loves how they make his 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; beard feel (so do I!). He also uses the shampoo for his Friar Tuck-style hair, and it&#x27;s still lasted a full eight weeks. (The manufacturer is correct about needing only a little of the product.)</li>
            <li> First soap that actually works for long beards. Works AWESOME with Amish Beard Balm leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my beard nice and clean every day. Couple it with a nice beard lube and you have yourself a great beard!</li>
            <li> awesome! smells great too!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my skin less itchy.</li>
            <li> finally I have found a beard shampoo that actually feels like it is doing something...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it a few times a week (along with some other beard care products), and I can already tell a difference in my beard..it looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that makes you stop feeling like you have steel wool on your face is a winner..and this product does that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points: A little bit goes a long way, I can barely tell that it&#x27;s even been used.</li>
            <li> After receiving this item I was a little surprised. It&#x27;s a very small cube of product. But it has lasted for months and months. I use it about twice a week and it does a great job of cleaning my beard. I use beard balm every day and it sometimes doesn&#x27;t wash out with normal water. This always does the trick. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Your face will literately scream at you &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves bear manageable. Can also be use to wash your entire head area - will not over dry skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very nurturing ALL around and makes your beard, face and hair feel and look great.</li>
            <li> As far as receiving product on time very good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels great. Trying to find a good way to secure it for travel when wet. No. 1 in the one-two punch with the profs beard care gloss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to get away from using my normal shampoo, which dried out my beard and mustache significantly. The shampoo bar isn&#x27;t really so much of a bar as it is a cube. I&#x27;ve cut mine into four even rectandular bits, which will hopefully help it last longer. After using this shampoo I will never go back! This stuff softens and conditions my beard and mustache. If you are someone who has a course or unrully beard, get this shampoo now. I&#x27;ve had no problems with getting knots or tangles out of my beard and it is easier to style now. I will be using this product for the rest of my bearded days.</li>
            <li> This makes my beard shiny and smooth. It goes on smooth, better than wax, and does not flake off.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, but need more time to review.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, only need a very small amount.  Basically I drag it down each side and across my chin, and get more lather than I could ever need.  Had it three months and can hardly even tell the block has gotten smaller.  Helps with the dry and unruly hairs, and the scent works nicely.  Enough that I like it but does not linger enough to compete with others.</li>
            <li> good stuff. I have a ginger beard and my wife complains it&#x27;s bristly. This, plus some beard oil, helps soften it. Manly scent, not frou-frou stuff. Good company, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend...he was totally impressed with the product!</li>
            <li> This product did a great job of getting rid of some beard dandruff I had.  I use it twice a week and it keeps my beard nice and clean and helps keep the texture of my beard nice.  Since using it there has been a noticeable difference in how healthy the skin is below the beard.  I was a little worried that using a bar on my face would be weird, but it&#x27;s really not bad.  Be sure to store it some place out of your shower stall when you&#x27;re not using it so the bar doesn&#x27;t dissolve away from the shower water when it runs.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product, it smells great and leaves his beard beautiful.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a &#x27;fun&#x27; gift for a friend and his crazy beard -- he ended up using it and loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. No itching or dandruff, Very Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband . He LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Just reordered more. Its cube shape is perfect for getting a good lather going on your hands. It leaves my beard soft and manageable and i am constantly getting complimented on my beard. Great smell also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Leaves my beard feeling clean and soft. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice. The soap bar was somewhat large, compared to what I expected. I got this for my son. He says he likes it, so thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Makes a truly noticeable difference and NO beard dandruff anymore!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend whom has a very long, full beard. It smells great and makes his beard soooo soft!!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. He said he liked it. He only uses it when he takes a shower.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than an out of control beard! Beard hair is not the same as the hare on your head. It dries out and can become a hot mess if you don&#x27;t take care of it. I use this and Honest Amish Beard Balm after I shower. It keeps my beard shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Well first off I&#x27;m new to the beard thing,been growing mine for 6 months or so,I tried the same brand fuzzworthy for the beard care and gloss first,thought it was great,I then ordered the same fuzzworthy brand shampoo soap bar/block,follow the directions,it&#x27;s real natural soap type texture, it has a trippy smell at first,wash beard well lathered in shower using the beard shampoo,wait for beard to dry then scrape a small amount of the beard care gloss with your finger nail and rub it to together,massage into your skin under the beard and around, then get out the comb and take your time combing through beard,the fuzz products compliment each other very well,I&#x27;m growing my beard and I will try competing some day. Fake botox injected catfish looking women don&#x27;t like beards or hair in general,my beard is all real no fake extensions.men stop being p-whipped and grow a beard, it&#x27;s free,so take your freedom back!real men wear beards.lick it</li>
            <li> Perfect, everything a man with a beard needs. I love it and this is my 3rd bar. I also love that it&#x27;s a square and easy to fit in my giant man-bear hands.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the way it cleans and conditions his beard. I love the way it smells.  Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo. Gets a great lather and cleans effectively. The block form is the only downfall. If I leave it in the shower it gets soft and dissolves quicker like any soap bar would. For now I just remove it from the shower when I exit it and store the bar on a dry dish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Been Using This For A Couple Of Weeks Now. My Beard Is WAY More Manageable And The Wife Digs How Soft It Is. Plus, It Smells Awesome And Manly. It&#x27;s A Definite Repeat For Me. - BB</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> First time letting my beard grow out this works great makes my beard shine love it and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Only way to go when it comes to beard shampoo. Has a nice sandalwood smell to it. Use it three times a week and the bar lasts about a month. I store mine in the shower high on the shelf to prevent unnecessary water wearing away at it. Lathers good, keeps the beard dust away, smells great. Definitely the way to go in regards to beard shampoos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I was just using soap or occasionally shampoo and never ever ever again! My full and soft beard is now fuller, softer and oh so fluffy. And so easy to manage now. Just love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Father&#x27;s Day, to pamper his beard. He&#x27;s never used beard products before, but he absolutely loved this shampoo. A cube-shaped container to keep it in would have been helpful to come with the product for those who keep this in the shower. But this smells great, and he got a kick out of having dedicated beard soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my beard. Make it feel so soft and it feels so soft and smell great</li>
            <li> Only had this stuff for 2 days and I HAD to come write a review.  I needed something that would lather well and do a better job than regular shampoo...something that was made for beards, ya know?  I came across this little bad boy and saw it had great reviews, so I decided to give it a try.  I have zero regrets.  This little square cube of heaven lives up to the reputation forecasted by it&#x27;s reviewers.  Great lather after only minimal application.  Leaves my beard soft and no stinky smell in my mustache area.  I WILL be buying again when this runs out, which will probably be a long time from now.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I suspected the shampoo I had been using was causing the skin on my face to break out. I used it for a week and the break outs are gone. I also really like the scent. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good.  I opened my mailbox just after the mail man put it in and my mail box smelled great.  I tried it out in shower and a little bit goes a long way.  Suds up great and smells just as good as it did when i first opened it.  It was recommended to me and I will continue to recommend this to other friends. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Builds a rich lather with minimal usage of the bar. Rinses cleanly (not greasy/oily) and leaves a nice fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this twice now.  I&#x27;m happy with the product, but still haven&#x27;t tried any competing  beard soaps/shampoos.  This has been a good option for an all natural beard wash.  You can&#x27;t try everything at once, but this is a decent place to start.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard nice and smooth, has a pretty good shampoo fragrance</li>
            <li> Makes my scruffy beard look and feel great! Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace traditional shampoo and I must say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get a thick lather and it seems to keep my beard fluffy and smelling good</li>
            <li> Started using this a couple weeks ago. It works great. Cleans very well and has helped shine up my beard. Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get a lot of use as I have a long beard and the bar is pretty small , but in two week of everyday use it seems like it will last quite a while. Very happy!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of lather that comes off that little cube. A must for all the bearded.</li>
            <li> My beard feels really great after a shower and cleanse with this stuff. I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I have been growing my beard for the past 6 months, which I believe is the longest it&#x27;s ever been (nothing impressive, but quite thick).  I regularly used the same shampoos and conditioners that I used on my head, but my beard always felt brittle and coarse.  With a quick google search, I realized there was a whole world of beard products that I had never known about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent, gentle shampoo that lathers into a rich wash for the face fur.  The smell is a little unusual, and the &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; description sounds appropriate.  However, I quite like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to remain after rinsing, so it&#x27;s really not an issue either way.  After rubbing the bar on my face, I will give my beard a good rubbing with these tree-cutting, fly-fishing, bear wrestling weapons that I call hands.  After rinsing, my beard feels cleaner than ever.  Make sure not to stop there though.  Get yourself a good conditioner and/or beard oil/wax to make sure you&#x27;re achieving your maximum manly potential.  Think it&#x27;s manly to have an all-natural, unkempt, untreated brillo pad filled with tasty morsols of food on your face?  You&#x27;re wrong.  It&#x27;s 2014.  You&#x27;re not a bum.  You&#x27;re a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one month ago, and there&#x27;s still enough to last me easily another month, maybe two.  Granted, I only use it a few times a week, so if you plan on using it daily it may not last as long for you.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that where I leave it seems to degrade it more than my actual use.  It resides on a shower caddy under my showerhead, and while the water doesn&#x27;t drip onto it directly, I&#x27;m sure it catches some splashes at least.  The bottom of the shampoo bar takes the shape of the grate it rests on, so I know I&#x27;m losing a little bit of longevity out of it from my placement.  I recommend not doing that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First beard-specific shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m so happy with it though, that it may be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Using it once will not makeyou look like that dapper gentleman seen pictured on the box with a raging heart of untamed fire and computer-defeating chess-champion intellect.  But your partner may think so, and that&#x27;s mildly important.</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend tried the shampoo for the first time, I almost wrecked my car because I touched his cheek. I literally gasped at how soft his beard was after the FIRST shampooing. I expected the shampoo to take a while to soften his facial hair but it was instantaneous. Then I expected the softness to plateau, but it didn&#x27;t. The smell is light and pleasant to those around; though my boyfriend did say that the taste transferred to his lips. Aside from that, he&#x27;s as happy with the product as I am.</li>
            <li> I never thought a beard shampoo can make so much difference. I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff....leaves my beard soft and smelling good. The scent took a while to get used to but I love it now. Only con is the awkward square shaped bar, but even that can be overlooked</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good too!!  Makes my beard feel very soft afterward!!</li>
            <li> It leaves your beard feeling clean and fresh. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Lathers nice and smells great.  If you are all that is MAN, you will buy this and use daily.  I also love the name PROFESSOR FUZZWORTHY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriends loves this beard wash. He has a used a few and this is the only one he has asked me to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Grow the beard they said, it will get you laid they said.  Dudes seriously, get this soap.  It smells like mahogany and rich leathers.  Women swoon to me on the reg now.  Don&#x27;t tell my wife though.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing. Get some good pine tar soap.</li>
            <li> This beard gloss shampoo is pretty legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great (I wish they made a candle!) and leaves my beard and skin below feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest anyone working on (or maintaining) their beard to only use this bad boy once a week and supplement it with beard oils and the occasional conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t let it sit in a soap dish as it will get all soggy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few beard shampoo&#x27;s to date and Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s has worked the best so far. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is incredible, makes your beard tingle...</li>
            <li> I have had a beard of varied thickness for nearly 10 years.  I cannot believe I just now stumbled upon this product!!  I use it three times per week in combination with a nice beard oil and have seen a dramatic improvement in my beard, both in softness and in overall \\&quot;health\\&quot; (not as many wiry, prickly ends).  My beard is much easier to comb and style and the number of ingrown hairs has plunged to zero!  I have always used beard oils so I cannot help but attribute the recent improvements to Prof. Fuzzworthy&#x27;s shampoo bar.  I have been on the same bar for almost two months and still have about 1/3 of it left.  I will DEFINITELY be buying more!!</li>
            <li> It makes my boyfriends beard really soft and he loves it and it has a nice smell to it definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very cool and different. Gave as a birthday gift. It was a hit.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and gives beard a great feel afterwards.  Plus it is a perfect cube out of the box!!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel nice and soft, it&#x27;s never looked so good....</li>
            <li> Cleans my beard and leaves it full and soft.  I highly recommend it for beardsmen with allergies to colognes and heavy scents. I have scent allergies, and this product is wonderful.  The scent is very natural smelling doesn&#x27;t stay around after you rinse the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf cannot keep her hands off of my beard. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product.  &#x27;Nuff said</li>
            <li> Professor Fuzzworth&#x27;y  Beard Shampoo is what it claims. A quality Beard Care product that works. The secret is moderation, use only what works. Rinse well after use, dry then use  Professor Fuzzworth&#x27;y  Beard Care Gloss as a followup. I have not experienced any irritation with either product.</li>
            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;see instant results&amp;#34; product, but it&#x27;s a great addition to a simple regimen to keep your beard soft and tame (or untamed if that&#x27;s your thing).  The soap comes as a cube, so I took the liberty of buying a travel soap dish and cutting the bar into fourths, which works perfectly.  Two thumbs up for a smaller company that cares about its products and customers.</li>
            <li> This is a quality 100%natural beard shampoo. I got one box of it in the beginning of this year and I am now just having to replace it. I would definitely recommend it to any man with a beard. It smells natural and kind of earthy. A great product all around. A little will last you for a long time. I cut mine into 3 even pieces to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Kinda smells like hippies.  Cleans beard well, I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift form my son. My son loves this product. He says it makes his beard soft and manageable, and his skin is not irritated as with regular soaps and shampoos. And this product has a nice spicy scent that does not irritate the senses. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didnt understand how to really use it, should have come with instructions.  Got my d!@# stuck in a vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It smells good and seems to do a great job.  It also seems like the bar will last quite a while.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to create a good lather, just a swipe over most of the surfaces of the beard.</li>
            <li> The receiver of this gift was pleasantly surprised by the smell of this item. He also liked that it came in solid soap form - easy to put in the shower and not another bottle to worry about.</li>
            <li> Lathers up easily and has a great woodsy smell.  Leaves my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is a gift and has not been used</li>
            <li> First beard shampoo I ever bought and it worked wonders. Beard and skin felt amazing first time using it and the itchiness went away within three-four days.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has been growing out his beard for a while and has tried different products to make the appearance more full as opposed to scraggly and for a softer touch. After using the shampoo and conditioner product, his beard felt and looked amazing! I understand why this stuff is so highly rated now. He used to get compliments before, but now he gets them far more - it looks more full, and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was always complaining about how itchy and smelly his beard got and just couldn&#x27;t take it so he would always shave it off at a certain point. Now, his beard is soft, and it smells so good! I would recommend this product to any bearded man who is frustrated like my BF was.</li>
            <li> This is a really good shampoo for your beard cleans well only gripe I have about the product I&#x27;m not really into the smell to earthy and hippyish for me but use on my beats daily cuz I like the results I get with the cleanliness</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap. You get a lot of laughter. My beard feels good after using this soap.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this product! And it is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it! I love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s made with quality ingredients. Also purchased the beard gloss which he likes too.</li>
            <li> This beard shampoo smells amazing, lathers nicely, and really softens my beard. If you have never used a shampoo designed for beards; give this a try.</li>
            <li> love the way it feels in my beard. It keeps it healthy, shiny, hydrated and tamed.</li>
            <li> I was having issue with some beard dandruff and went looking for a solution. This stuff works great and leaves my beard feeling great. Add in the same brand beard wax for finishing and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li> Love the small of this stuff and makes my beard feel really healthy.</li>
            <li> much like their conditioning gloss, this stuff is great. The wife loves the smell almost as much as i do, which is a huge bonus. So far, i&#x27;ve used it daily with no complaints. Leaves my beard feeling clean, bushy, and i&#x27;d even say lighter. Overall, 5/5 and i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, has somewhat of a strong odor to me, but I have a sensitive nose. Kind of a leathery pepper smell, but disappears after washing. Is basically a Cube of soap. I put it in a Ziploc baggie in my shampoo rack when not using to keep it from melting away unnecessarily when not in use. It has a good lather. My favorite wash to date though is still Medicine Man Anti Itch beard wash, amazing lather, comes in a pump and only takes one squirt to fully lather your face.</li>
            <li> I like the sent. This product works awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li> Works great. I started off on the wrong foot. I didn&#x27;t think it was lathering so I kept adding more. Well it just blew up! Now just a little works and it help with the dry skin under the hair way better and faster than oils added after the shower. Excellent product and a great base to have to extend the help from post shower oils or balm.</li>
            <li> So I got this for my bearded man because we are in a dryer area and his beautiful beard was getting a little crispy crunchy... The picture gives the impression that the bar of soap is larger than it is and when we took it out of the box, It was a little square bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;The shape is akward with harsh corners and really not something you want to rub on your face and or in your beard. It also never really conditioned my mans beard the way we thought it would. I ended up buying a different condition that is working out much better.</li>
            <li> Clean beard, no problems. Great stuff. Just a little will give you a great lather, and wash away yesterday&#x27;s lunch. Unless you want to save it for breakfast. In that case don&#x27;t wash until after you&#x27;ve eaten the leftovers.</li>
            <li> Hubby Loves it!! I was very surprised that it was a bar or rather a cube of soap. I just assumed it was liquid. anyway my hubby raves about it and says he wished he had this from the beginning a facial hair growth :)</li>
            <li> I kinda like this soap. It comes as a cube and I don&#x27;t seem to work through it too quickly. It lathers up nice too. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with dandruff or itching with my beard, but it is nice to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Will only soften your beard for about five minutes, then it&#x27;ll go back to being all frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard shine. Use to use everyday shampoo and conditioner and it dried out my skin and beard. It has definitely improved the look and feel of my facial hair. On my way to have a beard as manly as Professor Fuzzworthy himself.</li>
            <li> GARBAGE!!!!!! Do not buy this s*** product. Unless the price goes down to .25 cents it&#x27;s as good as trash. I want my money back!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m new to the beard thing, and normally shave it when it gets too long. it may be theregular shampoo and conditioner i always used, but the beard never felt comfortable. i was getting discouraged and almost shaved it all off (2 month growth), until a friend told me about this shampoo. i can honestly say my beard has never felt better! after using this, my beard is cleaner, doesn&#x27;t itch, and easier to comb before putting in any oil or wax. this is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a beard! just ordered my second bar, even though my first is still half full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to come straight out and say it. This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vikings, Paul Bunyan, Chuck Norris, heavy metal bands the world over, some women, and YOU! They all have one thing in common - They sport some pretty badass whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve got a pretty mean looking set of whiskers myself and I can&#x27;t believe I used to use just regular ol&#x27; shampoo and conditioner on my man parts - my whiskers. A bottle of shampoo and conditioner together cost more than a single brick of this manly product. I wasted so much time and money! Now I can get in the shower and get the hell out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap comes in a small cube but with a beard comes wisdom so don&#x27;t be fooled by outside appearances. There&#x27;s some top quality stuff contained within this pint sized cube. Shampoo, conditioner, and specialized conditioning oils be damned!  This little cube contains all of the oils/conditioning products I used to use and then some and has me smelling like man again! No more lady soap just to get a smooth looking beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been growing your man face for a while or are just starting out then I highly advise you to grab a cube of this, slap it on your face and start feeling and looking like a man again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a serious &#x27;beardsman&#x27; but I&#x27;ve got a bit of chin hair and keep the top quite short so I don&#x27;t really buy any regular shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a nice fragrance, the block of soap is pretty substantial for my use, and a little goes a LONG way.  After a few uses, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> For my money, this is the best product for a healthy, soft, clean beard. Great fragrance and eliminates embarrassing beard dandruff.. Next to deodorant, this is the most important product in my bathroom... Save time and buy two! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great lather with a small amount.  Completely eliminates &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.  Great manly scent.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband.  It works great! His beard is super soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> So after reading the mixed reviews on this product I have come to the conclusion, that some people expect miraculous change overnight or after a single use from a bar of soap (because they aren&#x27;t realistic enough to realize its just soap, or that they lack a brain) . It took about 2-3 days for me to notice a change. The fact is that what works for one, does not always work for another. There are way to many factors to say this is a cure all for all that is bad about your beard. That said, I really like this shampoo, YES its a BAR form, or more precisely a block. YES it is a very Earthy / Wood Scent. It DOES NOT replace things like a good quality beard balm or beard oil, but a great compliment to these products. Previously I had been using just shampoo and a good quality conditioner on a daily basis to keep my beard from being the Brillo pad/ wire brush constancy it normally is. I now only use this soap along with a good beard balm, as it did get rid of the dry skin and beard dandruff that was caused by my original method of care (shampoo and conditioner) . My beard is not only softer but also more manageable, so it did as it said it would.  IT WILL NOT straighten your beard or de-tangle it, That&#x27;s what a comb and/or a brush are for. IT WILL NOT make your beard shine like your super dope wheels on your 90&#x27;s Honda, but will be shinier than the flat paint or powder coat on your fixie bike. Be real its an all natural Soap that does a good job of cleaning and conditioning. The only negative that I found to this block that will likely last me at least 2 months is the $12 price point, But that&#x27;s for you to decide if a product that can replace two others and keep your beard clean is worth it...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this when I ordered it as it doesn&#x27;t look like any &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever seen.  But the price was decent, the reviews were good, and I was intrigued.  My beard was starting to feel dry and look unruly, despite my using my regular shampoo and conditioner on it, and I needed to do something.  I&#x27;ve been using this product about two weeks now, and it does the job great. Beard is soft and manageable and paired with the wax/conditioner, it is looking like I want it to look.  The smell is unique, and I like it.  I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Could be happier but it serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love the smell it leaves on my beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Please keep producing :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this soap for his beard and so do I, it makes it feel so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - wet your beard and wet the soap. Rub the soap against your beard three or four times. Lathers very well, cleans very well and leaves beard feeling softer. I look forward to washing my beard with this soap because of the scent. With one or two exceptions, I wont go back to liquid beard shampoo. Best of all, there is no plastic bottle to dispose of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key to my rating system (extrapolate for music and movies): * &#x3D; Terrible. Unusable. Fiction so bad it&#x27;s not even laughable.  ** &#x3D; Substandard. Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations. Fiction is laughable.  *** &#x3D; Usable, but won&#x27;t purchase again. Wouldn&#x27;t read fiction by this author again, unless stuck in an airport for 12 hours with nothing else to read.  **** &#x3D; Meets my expectations. Will buy again unless I find a better product. Will read this author again. ***** &#x3D; Exceeds my expectations. Will buy author&#x27;s work automatically.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.  Smells nice, keeps the beard clean but with the oils you need.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my beard in the shower, and when it lathers up the beard is soooo soft. Smells very nice too, woodsy sort of aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I wash it out, by beard feels rough -- but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected after a shampoo. As long as you have some sort of conditioner or leave in balm to put in afterwards, you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will get all the dirt and old wax and nonsense out, so you have a fresh beard to start the day with.</li>
            <li> All around great product! It smells great and gets the job done. I have bought other liquid beard shampoos, but they don&#x27;t last very long and can get very expensive for daily use. This bar format reduces wasted product and is cheap enough to use every day (like it should be)! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grow a very impressive beard but this stuff lathers nice, has a pleasant smell, and I think my whiskers are softer.  I imagine someone with a thick beard would benefit from it most.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing. My beard was so smooth afterwards; I&#x27;m so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap comes in a nice cube which you just rub directly onto your beard and you create an incredibly rich lather, and then just massage your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this though is it doesn&#x27;t come in anything to store, which may not be a problem for people who want to store it in the shower, but if you do that it will probably degrade over time. While I was disappointed there is no storage container, I was able to store it in my shaving bowl which I use to lather up my shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an incredibly smooth beard, buy this right now.</li>
            <li> Great smell and appears to actually bring out some highlights on my beard.  Pleasant smell, not over bearing.  Would definitely comment!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box I was surprised that the bar of soap was brown and square in shape. I ended up cutting mine in half so that it was easier to use and more convenient to store. The smell is different but I like it. It lathers up like nobody&#x27;s business. I certainly think that it&#x27;s doing a great job of cleaning my my beard with ought being too harsh. I work outside in the construction industry and get a fair share of dirt and grime in my beard. This works on getting it clean and conditioned. I will by more in the future when mine runs out. Keep the bar dry when not in use. The soap seems to get soft fast. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves my beard feeling very soft &amp; healthy. The bar is in the sz of a small cube, could be bigger but I&#x27;m sure it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband - he uses it every day. Love the scent - I was expecting a liquid shampoo but the bar is good.</li>
            <li> Has an exceptional smell, leaves my beard nice and soft, lathers like you would not believe!</li>
            <li> works really good..&lt;br /&gt;i keep mine in the shower in a box to hold sope its starting to melt i guess. still works tho.&lt;br /&gt;so i guess keep out of the shower idk. still good product tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really convinced a beard shampoo is necessary, but this was an awesome product. I love the feel, the smell, and my beard does feel nice and soft after.</li>
            <li> Just takes a few rubs on my beard for an awesome lather and clean feel!  Should last a long time - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You want to keep your facial hair fresh.  Don&#x27;t forget to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had problems with my complexion. I bought this product in July and my complexion cleared up. I ran out and didn&#x27;t reorder, and my problems returned. I ordered this product again a week ago, and I am writing this review now, with a very clear and smooth face. This product simply makes caring for one&#x27;s face easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally cannot keep a beard without a product like this, and I look like I&#x27;m in high school without one. Now my students no longer confuse me with other students. The only problem is that it feels so good on my face that I want to use it too fast and then it&#x27;s gone. So, I have to remember to just lather and then use it.</li>
            <li> Lots of lather and a nice smell.  Should last me for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! I didn&#x27;t expect to. The bar is very dense and long lasting - just a couple of swipes across my wet beard and it soaps up nicely. If I decide to wash my face outside the shower, I cannot smell it, but in the shower it has a very pleasant scent. I even swipe it across my head and use as shampoo for my short hair. I imagine it will last at least a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks or so now and definitely notice a difference. My beard is so soft,  nourished and clean after use. Comes in a brown square and has a piney manley scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried growing a beard for ages only to shave it off largely cause of the itching and dandruff I&#x27;d get. This is the first and only product that has cured that. After using it for a few days the itching and dandruff are gone. I massage it into the beard and leave it for a few minutes. I recommend also using a good beard oil to help soften. I&#x27;ve been trying Beard Oil by Leven Rose.</li>
            <li> CLEAN YOUR DAMN BEARD !!! I really love this product. I have tried different types of soaps but this one really cleans your beard and keeps your skin moisturized . Keeps your beard healthy or maybe that&#x27;s just me, not sure. I recommend HIGHLY</li>
            <li> Best shampoo Ive used for my beard. Make hair super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid block of shampoo not liquid, but it has a great lather once you wet it. Great woodsy scent that leaves your beard clean.</li>
            <li> Great beard shampoo, hands down. One bar will last you about 6 months. Lathers up great, leaves beard feeling like your hair feels after a nice quality shampoo. Well worth it to purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! The key to having a good beard, that isn&#x27;t wild and itchy, is using a shampoo that&#x27;s made for beards.....and not washing it every night. I wash my beard twice a week and this is all ill use now! It is small, but when used correctly will last. I don&#x27;t keep it in the shower. I use it, dry it with the towel and put it back in the box. It&#x27;s too expensive/good to let any go to waste! Wet your beard, slide this over the top of your whiskers two or three times and then lather up! It&#x27;s amazing how much it will lather and clean your beard! Afterwards let it dry and follow up with beard oil. Twice a week and you&#x27;ll have a shiny and healthy beard!</li>
            <li> Smells great and has worked wonders on my beard. Began using this along side a conditioner and brush. Beard is looking better than it ever has before.</li>
            <li> Block was a little smaller than I expected. Wife doesn&#x27;t like the fragrance. The soap cleans my beard and &#x27;stache well, but the lather is thick and takes a bit more time and effort to rinse out.</li>
            <li> So this gets an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; rating for a couple reasons. First, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s soap that comes in a hard block that you need to get wet and lather. Second, the smell is interesting - not bad per se but definitely earthy smelling... It leaves my beard feeling good, but not as soft as I would have hoped. I was hoping for that freshly shampooed feeling, not the almost dry/tacky feeling you get when using soap...</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my beard clean and soft. Plus fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the first time today and this product really works well! I was using regular shampoo and conditioner every few days and my 3 month beard was brittle and dry. This lathered up very nice with minimal soap needed.  I finished up with Amish Beard Balm and my beard has never looked better. Soft and clean! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Make a lot of foam and helps with the dryness of the skin</li>
            <li> My husband is new to beard care products, but loves this shampoo!  It smells great and he says his face is less itchy!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; and lathers almost like a shaving soap. In fact I use the lather to shape up my beard on my neck with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well without leaving a dry brittle beard.I don&#x27;t use everyday as I feel there is no need to shampoo everyday. After usin this product, follow up with your favorite beard oil for best results.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the product, it was actually a lot smaller than I assumed it would be, maybe 2&amp;#34; cubed, but I have been using for about a month and don&#x27;t feel I will need to reorder for about 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> Lathers up quickly and easy to work through beard!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for a Christmas stocking stuffer. He has had his beard for 10 years and there have been times when his face gets dry so regular shampoo on his beard is not the best option. He has really enjoyed the lather that this bar forms while in the shower and the aroma is spicy which I like. I will buy this again for him!</li>
            <li> Husband likes it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I must say I did not think it would work. But I just got out of the shower and wow its soft and a ton of color showed up that I did not Know was there !! good stuff !</li>
            <li> We received this way faster than expected and love the product! Lathers up great, love how it smells, and it seems like it will be long lasting...will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Seems like an OK product. Not sure what I expected. I do not mind the smell, actually kind of like the manly wooded smell. it does get a good lather in the beard, but I did not notice an actual difference between using this and using regular soap or facial wash. The only thing I can think, is that it may help dull the points of the hair, which would be a good thing. Doesnt hurt the ladies and less itch.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Possibly. I still continue to use it, so there is something that seems draw me to it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell and appreciates that the soap comes in bar form. It works for him. I like the smell too</li>
            <li> Working with my first beard, and this shampoo has made it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes me smell like a pine forest, but keeps my beard neat and clean. Good product. Would recommend to all of my brothers in beard.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great and leaves my beard very soft. Also, I was curious what to do with a square cube of shampoo, but I&#x27;ve had this thing for several months and it never seems to get any smaller! A little bit creates a really rich lather. Some times after I shave my head, I even use some up top. Will continue to buy this (if I ever run out of the one I have now)</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband LOVES! This stuff smells great too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Its lasted me a few months already and still has plenty of life left in it. I use it usually once every other day or so. It is a cube kind of like a bar of soap. I just get it wet and rub it around on m beard. It gets a nice lather and leaves my beard soft and manageable. I would recommend this product to all my bearded brethren.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.The only product that leaves my beard soft after washing. Love the smell, and i use it on my head now, too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, foams up nice with very little use and also smells delightful. I have seen and felt a difference in my beard. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> After applying Professor Edward Fuzzworthy&#x27;s beard shampoo liberally, my beard finally reflects the gentleman I always knew I was.</li>
            <li> I bought this beard shampoo for my hubby.  I love how it lathers up in his beard, and the smell is clean, fresh and manly.  It leaves his beard soft.  As and added bonus the beard acne is going away.  This one is wife approved.</li>
