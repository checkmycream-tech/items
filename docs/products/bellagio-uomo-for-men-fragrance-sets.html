            <li> I liked the smell and the size of the containers. This was a steal on Amazon. The cheapest I found on the market was Target at a whopping 55.00 per set. I bought two from amazon at 60% of that price. The women in our lives were not complaining needless to say :)!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this set from a friend of mine. Absolutely loved it. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent but was disappointed when It didn&#x27;t last 15 min. This must be a knock off. Somebody should care more than to sell this crap that&#x27;s going to upset everybody !!</li>
            <li> My clumsy self tripped and broke my Father&#x27;s favorite cologne. I found the set here on Amazon and was pleased with the seller feedback and the price. The item arrived before expected and my Father was very pleased :-)</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my husband. He loved it. It smells great and the price is really good for what you get. I think women can use this scent too. It&#x27;s a scent anyone can use not too strong.    I ordered from Perfumespot. They were great shipping was super fast. Ordered Feb 2, and got my item Feb 4th on standard shipping.</li>
            <li> This smells like aquadeegeeoh not many people can tell the differance. Get it you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected</li>
            <li> Had a bottle years ago, ran out recently and bought this to refill my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a month.... not my top ten edt of my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no wow factor with this edt</li>
            <li> I have the set wich for the money i believe is kind ok but i will never buy this again you spray on and no even last one our i used this cologne years ago and was better quality than this one just dont buy it doesnt worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! The after shave balm makes your skin soft and feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 10 years and have bought several bottles in Las Vegas.  This one smells different.  Not worth returning but I won&#x27;t buy online again.</li>
            <li> just simple is the best cologne i have ever used... too bad is still a little hard to find it</li>
            <li> It was great to find this cologne since is no longer is available in stores.  My husband loves this cologne and was excited to get it on his birthday.</li>

            <li> This is a very nice product for gifting to some one near &amp; dear. It was delivered in time as expected, the price is reasonable &amp; it has a very good fragrance. I love it.. &amp; I believe you would too.</li>
