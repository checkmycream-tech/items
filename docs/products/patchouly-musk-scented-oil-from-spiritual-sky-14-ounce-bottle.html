            <li>The scent wasnt one that smelled good on me, but smells great at the house.</li>
            <li>A very nice musky aroma in a fair priced oil.</li>
            <li>this aroma is very strong, so use it sparingly!</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>Good oil - use for crafts.  </li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t have a good combo.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>and you were good all day.  </li>

            <li>This product is excellent and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love it...reminds me of my days at Woodstock!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and although my fave is an amber patchouli roll on, this is good stuff too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice balance of patchouli and musk.</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend who liked it and have been on the hunt for another patchouli product.</li>
            <li>A nice oil for the price</li>
            <li>I bought Toms incense on amazon and will for sure but more products from them!</li>
            <li>Nice to have someone go by, and say, what are you wearing? :)</li>
            <li>This by far is the best brand.</li>
            <li>awesome marked as one of my favorite seller&#x27;s. :)</li>
            <li>this oil is very very light brown.  </li>
            <li>Nice easy to carry bottle, but cap should have serations around it to facilitate opening.</li>
            <li>Wear it in good health :);) !</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of this brand, this bottle literally has No smell!</li>
            <li>( it is sexy ..</li>
            <li>I lost count years ago of how many people have asked me what it is I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>Was ok.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent of musk.</li>
            <li>However, this combined scent I thought I would love.</li>
            <li>Could have a bit more essence</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It is an authentic scent.  </li>
            <li>is one of my favorite aromas.</li>
            <li>But it was an ok product.</li>
            <li>I feel satisfied wearing this scent as if I belonged in a Commune.  </li>
            <li>I guess I love the contradictions here.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>To me this was more musk than anything.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil because I love musk perfume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy more feeling</li>
            <li>This is a lovely blend of Patchouli and musk.</li>
            <li>Okay, still not the Patchouli scent I am searching for.</li>
            <li>Been using for many years, and this does not smell like patchouli to me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand for over 20 years now.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I just love these scents that are more spicy or musky...nice deal</li>
            <li>youth. :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I would have given this a five star rating if you could smell more musk in this oil.</li>
            <li>Depending on what you use oil for &amp; how you use it, this fits the bill for most people.</li>
            <li>I Love Musk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most fragrant.  </li>
            <li>This oil has a very distinct, one of a kind smell.</li>
            <li>I got a gift certificate for amazon, and YOURS was the first place that I wanted to go to spend it!!!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with the product all, for it melded quite well into my shave oil mixes, and worked quite well as a perfume on its own.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>and then they just smile warmly.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will get more !</li>
            <li>and I reordered the oil and got it very quickly,</li>
            <li>When I first put the oil on, it smells great, for the first 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love me some Patchouli and happy to find a heavier, longer lasting brand!</li>
            <li>Not too strong</li>
            <li>I like the residue from the scent, but find it can be too strong at times</li>
            <li>Everyone loves it, even those who were never a \\&quot;hippie\\&quot; or a free spirit.</li>
            <li>but I differentially feel like I was screwed all in the name of the mighty dollar.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to smell great at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I love the combination of musk and patchouli, and this scented oil is just right.  </li>
            <li>I love true pure patchouli, but this musk fusion was not at all appealing.</li>
            <li>that was originally manufactured at the Hare Krishna farm in NSW Australia since the Sixties and the export quality ,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lil more musky than I expected (esp in the bottle), but it&#x27;s lovely on with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Some claim this is how they remember Patchouli, but I was looking for a more pure Patchouli scent.  </li>
            <li>I use Patchouli with Dragon&#x27;s Blood and this provides a sweet, spicy scent that works for me.</li>
            <li>The Spiritual Sky brand used to  be good</li>
            <li>The scent brings back good memories.</li>
            <li>You can smell the patchouli but the added musk gives it a more modern smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li>was a true smelling Patchouli.</li>
            <li>The dry-down is really soft and warm.</li>
            <li>I CAUGHT A WIFF OF PATCHOULI SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li>Quick Heads</li>
            <li>Long lasting, perfect blends.  </li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant, but it is extremely week.</li>
            <li>Smells just right</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very earthy and sweet.  </li>
            <li>Nice smaller very peace espiritual I lover</li>
            <li>Regarding : perfumed body oils produced by SPIRITUAL SKY ...and sold by Rainbow Records , and available from AMAZON !</li>
            <li>I personally love SPIRITUAL SKY&#x27;S ( patchouli musk !)</li>
            <li>This should last me for many years to come.</li>
            <li>it just smells like old mans cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and could not find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a Hippie, though I was born mid 60&#x27;s, and I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>It brings back lots of memories for many people.</li>
            <li>Odor is mostly patchouli with only a hint of musk.  </li>
            <li>The bottle may be small, but it comes packed with big scent, for a great price too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that anyone else will be able to smell it at all unless they are well within my personal space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as I&#x27;d hoped it would be</li>
            <li>This seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent from Spiritual Sky.  </li>
            <li>Harsh chemical vapor smell contained in most patchouli products is strong in this brand.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s not over bearing and really like wearing the cheap old Patchouli we wore in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I like the musk better than the regular patchouli, but both are decent.</li>
            <li>and it is a time less scent spiritual sky is great</li>
            <li>The old formula was very masculine with a nice deep woods musk smell now</li>
            <li>Very relaxing</li>
            <li>Thanks i received my item of patchouli today</li>
            <li>This is straight up, earthy and musky smelling patchouli.</li>
            <li>I really like this blend of patchouli and musk.  </li>
            <li>Just a dab will do ya for the whole day.</li>
            <li>-- it is a very bursty aroma.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite smells reminds me of my younger wild days.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for offering such cool stuff at affordable prices.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments on it daily, and frequently combine it over the Sandalwood this seller offers too.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Patchouli and I love Spiritual Sky products</li>
            <li>Two small dabs of this stuff will have you smelling great all day long.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, to me, it fades early (in about 4 hours or so) but other than that</li>
            <li>Long lasting, and potent.</li>
            <li>Nice scent if used in very small quantities.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn I guess</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll let you know why , there are two versions of Spiritual Sky , the original branded one, The Spiritual Sky range of oil  </li>
            <li>I usually end up putting a dab of this on, followed by a spritz of my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and even early!</li>
            <li>Smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li>i bought the exact same thing locally, googled the company and purchased it</li>
            <li>Year after year Spiritual Sky corners the market in high quality oils.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anything that you&#x27;d use essential oils for!</li>
            <li>if you want the real deal the nice smelling stuff look for the Aussie versions of the oils , you will know that it is the Australian version as there are no \\&quot;weird</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and its much sweeter smelling like cinnamon sugar than a different brand I tried-probably the musk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer this bottle over any other and have worn it since 1972 when I first discovered it.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is a very specific scent and if you are not used to it, you will certainly find it strange and overpowering.</li>
            <li>Spiritual Sky is THE natural oil scent brand of the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s hippie era.</li>
            <li>Item arrived way faster then expected and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>Spiritual Sky blends this eastern mint with musk, and they come away with a body oil that is lovely to say the least!</li>
            <li>i used this same brand and same bottle years ago and one drop would do, however my recent purchase is very very watered down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet or honey, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a lil more musky than I expected (esp in the bottle), but it&#x27;s lovely on with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Some claim this is how they remember Patchouli, but I was looking for a more pure Patchouli scent.  </li>
            <li> I use Patchouli with Dragon&#x27;s Blood and this provides a sweet, spicy scent that works for me.</li>
            <li> The Spiritual Sky brand used to  be good</li>
            <li> The scent brings back good memories.</li>
            <li> You can smell the patchouli but the added musk gives it a more modern smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> was a true smelling Patchouli.</li>
            <li> The dry-down is really soft and warm.</li>
            <li> I CAUGHT A WIFF OF PATCHOULI SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li> Quick Heads</li>
            <li> Long lasting, perfect blends.  </li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant, but it is extremely week.</li>
            <li> Smells just right</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very earthy and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Nice smaller very peace espiritual I lover</li>
            <li> Regarding : perfumed body oils produced by SPIRITUAL SKY ...and sold by Rainbow Records , and available from AMAZON !</li>
            <li> I personally love SPIRITUAL SKY&#x27;S ( patchouli musk !)</li>
            <li> This should last me for many years to come.</li>
            <li> it just smells like old mans cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and could not find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Hippie, though I was born mid 60&#x27;s, and I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> It brings back lots of memories for many people.</li>
            <li> Odor is mostly patchouli with only a hint of musk.  </li>
            <li> The bottle may be small, but it comes packed with big scent, for a great price too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that anyone else will be able to smell it at all unless they are well within my personal space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as I&#x27;d hoped it would be</li>
            <li> This seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent from Spiritual Sky.  </li>
            <li> Harsh chemical vapor smell contained in most patchouli products is strong in this brand.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not over bearing and really like wearing the cheap old Patchouli we wore in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like the musk better than the regular patchouli, but both are decent.</li>
            <li> and it is a time less scent spiritual sky is great</li>
            <li> The old formula was very masculine with a nice deep woods musk smell now</li>
            <li> Very relaxing</li>
            <li> Thanks i received my item of patchouli today</li>
            <li> This is straight up, earthy and musky smelling patchouli.</li>
            <li> I really like this blend of patchouli and musk.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab will do ya for the whole day.</li>
            <li> -- it is a very bursty aroma.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite smells reminds me of my younger wild days.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for offering such cool stuff at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments on it daily, and frequently combine it over the Sandalwood this seller offers too.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Patchouli and I love Spiritual Sky products</li>
            <li> Two small dabs of this stuff will have you smelling great all day long.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, to me, it fades early (in about 4 hours or so) but other than that</li>
            <li> Long lasting, and potent.</li>
            <li> Nice scent if used in very small quantities.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn I guess</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll let you know why , there are two versions of Spiritual Sky , the original branded one, The Spiritual Sky range of oil  </li>
            <li> I usually end up putting a dab of this on, followed by a spritz of my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and even early!</li>
            <li> Smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li> i bought the exact same thing locally, googled the company and purchased it</li>
            <li> Year after year Spiritual Sky corners the market in high quality oils.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anything that you&#x27;d use essential oils for!</li>
            <li> if you want the real deal the nice smelling stuff look for the Aussie versions of the oils , you will know that it is the Australian version as there are no \\&quot;weird</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and its much sweeter smelling like cinnamon sugar than a different brand I tried-probably the musk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer this bottle over any other and have worn it since 1972 when I first discovered it.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is a very specific scent and if you are not used to it, you will certainly find it strange and overpowering.</li>
            <li> Spiritual Sky is THE natural oil scent brand of the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s hippie era.</li>
            <li> Item arrived way faster then expected and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> Spiritual Sky blends this eastern mint with musk, and they come away with a body oil that is lovely to say the least!</li>
            <li> i used this same brand and same bottle years ago and one drop would do, however my recent purchase is very very watered down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet or honey, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It has multiple applications and is pretty long lasting...and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The old patchouli oil was a dark brown</li>
            <li> I put on a small amount &amp; wore it thru out the day but the scent didn&#x27;t seem to change much at all.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> the bottle was a tad bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I can see where this oil will go a long ways.</li>
            <li> I hope you can offer larger sizes even if slightly diluted.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the shipping experience but the product is terrible.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body in combination with my cologne, and occasionally put a few drops here and there around the house or in the car.</li>
            <li> , i order  to put in my closed with winter cloths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Remember - a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added Amber as my other choice and often layer the two...</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m used to other kinds of musk perfume but this just doesn&#x27;t smell like musk.</li>
            <li> The other sites advertized the musk version, which is what I did not want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either you love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> It also does not clean up well for other oils to step in.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Auric Blends patchouli oil</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..crummy product.</li>
            <li> using this product for a few years, and I  get losts of comments about it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be that person that everyone remembers -- too much patchouli embeds itself in other people&#x27;s brains as a bad memory.</li>
            <li> i mean cherry and coconut and other mixed fake</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Patchouli for the past 30+ years.</li>
            <li> Too small an amount although this was aromatic.</li>
            <li> Then I can hardly smell it at all.</li>
            <li> my cousin in the states loves this brand and she complained that it didnt smell anything like the bottle she got whilst in Australia</li>
            <li> waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> It even appears thin and watery for something claimed to be an oil  </li>
            <li> Not a great patchouli product.  </li>
            <li> Crummy worse oil I have ever purchased...</li>
            <li> At the very least, I think it will add a depth to other fragrances when used as a base.</li>
            <li> but if it is not handled properly in body scents ...it can be offensive , or somewhat like mosquito repellent !</li>
            <li> scents\\&quot; in the catalogue ( by weird</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong product.</li>
            <li> The Patchouly was difficult to even discern because of the over powering musk.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately had to return it.</li>
            <li> - you won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand of Patchouli or Patchouli combined scents.</li>
            <li> but now it stinks</li>
            <li> try to buy in store and it is very expensive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it is just nasty.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is awful now.  </li>

            <li> Good.  Not too strong</li>
            <li> Nice oil!! I like the fact that it&#x27;s not over bearing and really like wearing the cheap old Patchouli we wore in the 70&#x27;s. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is not essence oil, there is an element of musk and floral undertones. Some claim this is how they remember Patchouli, but I was looking for a more pure Patchouli scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and very fast shipping I will definitely buy from them again thank you</li>
            <li> Smells like an old lady. Maybe I can mix it with something else. I used to buy this brand of oil in college, but not this scent. Not too great.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very distinct, one of a kind smell. It&#x27;s quite different from a traditional patchouli, but can probably attribute that to the musk. Still though, I had totally different expectations. I was not disappointed with the product all, for it melded quite well into my shave oil mixes, and worked quite well as a perfume on its own. I receive many compliments on it daily, and frequently combine it over the Sandalwood this seller offers too. Long lasting, and potent. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Regarding : perfumed body oils produced by SPIRITUAL SKY ...and sold by Rainbow Records , and available from AMAZON ! I personally love SPIRITUAL SKY&#x27;S ( patchouli musk !) It calms my soul, mind , and spirit ! Patchouly ( patchouli ) Musk  ! Patchouli is an eastern mint plant ...but if it is not handled properly in body scents ...it can be offensive , or somewhat like mosquito repellent ! Spiritual Sky blends this eastern mint with musk, and they come away with a body oil that is lovely to say the least! ( it is sexy ..lol !) Wear it in good health :);) ! It brings the ladies running to you sometimes &lt;&lt; !( and if i smell it on their neck ..i am all in man ! ) PEACE-OUT , Doc Livingston</li>
            <li> Spiritual Sky is THE natural oil scent brand of the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s hippie era. I prefer this bottle over any other and have worn it since 1972 when I first discovered it. I lost count years ago of how many people have asked me what it is I&#x27;m wearing. Those who know remark that they are reminded of another time in their life. I&#x27;ve added Amber as my other choice and often layer the two...Everyone loves it, even those who were never a \\&quot;hippie\\&quot; or a free spirit. The aroma transcends trends and has endured hundreds, if not thousands, of years for a reason! Jesus probably even knew the scent...maybe even wore it!</li>
            <li> Good oil - use for crafts.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Was ok. The scent is what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. This should last me for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Smells just right</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Patchouli for the past 30+ years. I also love the scent of musk. However, this combined scent I thought I would love. Not so. The scent doesn&#x27;t have a good combo. I use Patchouli with Dragon&#x27;s Blood and this provides a sweet, spicy scent that works for me.</li>
            <li> A very nice musky aroma in a fair priced oil. Could have a bit more essence but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Always loved Petchouli and always will!</li>
            <li> I like it very much and will get more !</li>
            <li> I was loocking for this type of sxcent for a wile finally I found it is exatli what I was loocking for it</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant, but it is extremely week. It even appears thin and watery for something claimed to be an oil  I have previously used Auric Blends patchouli oil and all it took was one dab and you were good all day.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The Spiritual Sky brand used to  be good but now it stinks</li>
            <li> One star because I did not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.  I can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they did to the formula of this but it is just nasty.  The old formula was very masculine with a nice deep woods musk smell now it just smells like old mans cheap cologne.  I don&#x27;t know what they did but this stuff is awful now.  The old patchouli oil was a dark brown this oil is very very light brown.  It wasn&#x27;t a lot of money but I differentially feel like I was screwed all in the name of the mighty dollar.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for offering such cool stuff at affordable prices. I got a gift certificate for amazon, and YOURS was the first place that I wanted to go to spend it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I WILL CONTINUE ORDERING.</li>
            <li> Nice smaller very peace espiritual I lover</li>
            <li> I love it I use it on my body and burn it as a oil house fragrance. Tom got the best oils</li>
            <li> I love this product and could not find it locally anymore.  I was very glad to find it via Amazon!  :)</li>
            <li> Quick Heads Up  , Hi Guys my cousin in the states loves this brand and she complained that it didnt smell anything like the bottle she got whilst in Australia , I&#x27;ll let you know why , there are two versions of Spiritual Sky , the original branded one, The Spiritual Sky range of oil  that was originally manufactured at the Hare Krishna farm in NSW Australia since the Sixties and the export quality ,  if you want the real deal the nice smelling stuff look for the Aussie versions of the oils , you will know that it is the Australian version as there are no \\&quot;weird scents\\&quot; in the catalogue ( by weird i mean cherry and coconut and other mixed fake scents)&lt;br /&gt; the bottles should always look like this&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohm Shanti !!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong product. I wanted &amp;#34;Oil&#x27;, not &amp;#34;Musk&amp;#34;. and I reordered the oil and got it very quickly,</li>
            <li> Love the scent, to me, it fades early (in about 4 hours or so) but other than that, it&#x27;s a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is an authentic scent.  Very relaxing and I get compliments on it!  A little goes a long way.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Year after year Spiritual Sky corners the market in high quality oils.  Long lasting, perfect blends.  The price is always fair as well</li>
            <li> The scent brings back good memories. Thank you</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  When I first put the oil on, it smells great, for the first 15 minutes.  Then I can hardly smell it at all.</li>
            <li> is one of my favorite aromas. Not all like the smell, but it refreshes me and gives me great joy in smelling great. Nice to have someone go by, and say, what are you wearing? :)</li>
            <li> Great product...nice smell...the bottle was a tad bit smaller than I expected. But it was an ok product. I might buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the combination of musk and patchouli, and this scented oil is just right.  It has multiple applications and is pretty long lasting...and a little goes a long way.  I use it on my body in combination with my cologne, and occasionally put a few drops here and there around the house or in the car. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Hippie, though I was born mid 60&#x27;s, and I love this oil.  It&#x27;s very earthy and sweet.  I feel satisfied wearing this scent as if I belonged in a Commune.  I guess I love the contradictions here.  Warning:  this aroma is very strong, so use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF ROCKS!! I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Best smell in the world. Everyone recognizes it by name and then they just smile warmly. It brings back lots of memories for many people.</li>
            <li> I like Patchoulyusk  as scented oil, i order  to put in my closed with winter cloths.&lt;br /&gt;I try to buy in store and it is very expensive</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. One of my favorite smells reminds me of my younger wild days. Will order again when out.</li>
            <li> Nice scent if used in very small quantities.  Odor is mostly patchouli with only a hint of musk.  Harsh chemical vapor smell contained in most patchouli products is strong in this brand.</li>
            <li> I like the musk better than the regular patchouli, but both are decent. The longer you let the stuff age and become darker, the stronger the scent becomes.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It&#x27;s a lil more musky than I expected (esp in the bottle), but it&#x27;s lovely on with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> If you are a big musk fan, which I am not, then this might be your bag.  To me this was more musk than anything.  The Patchouly was difficult to even discern because of the over powering musk.  Not my favorite</li>
            <li> The best patchouly ever</li>
            <li> I love true pure patchouli, but this musk fusion was not at all appealing. I unfortunately had to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a body oil. The scent wasnt one that smelled good on me, but smells great at the house. Item arrived way faster then expected and wrapped very well. I can see where this oil will go a long ways. I bought Toms incense on amazon and will for sure but more products from them!</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because I love musk perfume. Maybe I&#x27;m used to other kinds of musk perfume but this just doesn&#x27;t smell like musk. Maybe the oil scent of musk is completely different. I put on a small amount &amp; wore it thru out the day but the scent didn&#x27;t seem to change much at all. I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> excellent product... i have been using this for years and it is a time less scent spiritual sky is great</li>
            <li> Love it...reminds me of my days at Woodstock!</li>
            <li> Too small an amount although this was aromatic. I didn&#x27;t buy more feeling I was paying for the brand and not the quantity/quality of the oil. I hope you can offer larger sizes even if slightly diluted.</li>
            <li> the scent was not of Musk or patchouli it was neither and I have added musk to it will not buy again</li>
            <li> This is a lovely blend of Patchouli and musk. The musk softens and sweetens the patchouli. I am a big fan of Patchouli and I love Spiritual Sky products - you won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand of Patchouli or Patchouli combined scents.</li>
            <li> Okay, still not the Patchouli scent I am searching for.</li>
            <li> even from the same manufacturer... i bought the exact same thing locally, googled the company and purchased it and it came w/ a slightly different &#x27;smell&#x27; as if the recipe was changed a bit.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of this brand, this bottle literally has No smell! I was happy with the shipping experience but the product is terrible. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> waste of money!!!  i used this same brand and same bottle years ago and one drop would do, however my recent purchase is very very watered down.  disapointed</li>
            <li> Not a great patchouli product.  Been using for many years, and this does not smell like patchouli to me.</li>
            <li> Thanks i received my item of patchouli today and i like it.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be just patchouli, not patchouli musk. That&#x27;s why i ordered from this site. The other sites advertized the musk version, which is what I did not want.Live and learn I guess</li>
            <li> This is straight up, earthy and musky smelling patchouli. It&#x27;s not sweet or honey, it&#x27;s the real deal. This is my favorite brand for over 20 years now.  I usually end up putting a dab of this on, followed by a spritz of my favorite perfume.  The combination is dizzying.  Highly recommended for anything that you&#x27;d use essential oils for!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, the smell has an amazing reach. You can smell the patchouli but the added musk gives it a more modern smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The bottle may be small, but it comes packed with big scent, for a great price too! Two small dabs of this stuff will have you smelling great all day long. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to smell great at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love patchouli, and although my fave is an amber patchouli roll on, this is good stuff too. Remember - a little bit goes a long way. Don&#x27;t be that person that everyone remembers -- too much patchouli embeds itself in other people&#x27;s brains as a bad memory.</li>
            <li> good quality oil. scent lasted. was a true smelling Patchouli. I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas present, wife loves this and so do I.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> awesome marked as one of my favorite seller&#x27;s. :)</li>
            <li> I just love these scents that are more spicy or musky...nice deal</li>
            <li> This is a nice balance of patchouli and musk. The dry-down is really soft and warm. My only wish is that it were a tiny bit stronger. I don&#x27;t think that anyone else will be able to smell it at all unless they are well within my personal space. That might turn out to be a good thing. Who knows? At the very least, I think it will add a depth to other fragrances when used as a base. Even as a stand-alone it smells very nice, if you can smell it. And yes, it does remind me of my (mis-spent?) youth. :)</li>
            <li> Before finding out that &#x27;Spiritual Sky&#x27; had sold out to another company, I ordered this product that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I got it and could NOT recognize the odor!  Yuck!  I gave it to a friend who liked it and have been on the hunt for another patchouli product.</li>
            <li> I CAUGHT A WIFF OF PATCHOULI SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT.  COULD NEVER FIND IT UNTIL I BOUGHT IT ON YOUR SITE.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this blend of patchouli and musk.  It&#x27;s exactly as I&#x27;d hoped it would be and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Will definitely purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> Love me some Patchouli and happy to find a heavier, longer lasting brand!</li>
            <li> The price was right. Just a dab will do ya for the whole day. Brings back memories of my younger days</li>
            <li> Patchouli is a very specific scent and if you are not used to it, you will certainly find it strange and overpowering. I like the residue from the scent, but find it can be too strong at times -- it is a very bursty aroma. It also does not clean up well for other oils to step in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find a patchouli fragrance I like. This is my second bottle and its much sweeter smelling like cinnamon sugar than a different brand I tried-probably the musk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints otherwise. The product arrived on time and even early! The bottle was stored and packaged well. This seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li> I would say A-Okay to anyone wanting tyo use this scent.  Nice easy to carry bottle, but cap should have serations around it to facilitate opening.</li>
            <li> Crummy worse oil I have ever purchased...The scent lasted only fifteen minutes then gone...Don&#x27;t waste your money..crummy product. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I am a hippy at heart. Grew up in the 60&#x27;s This by far is the best brand. Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li> A nice oil for the price &amp; I would have given this a five star rating if you could smell more musk in this oil. Depending on what you use oil for &amp; how you use it, this fits the bill for most people.</li>
            <li> Maybe Someone Will See It In My Collection And Want To Give It A Home.&lt;br /&gt;Not For Me. I Like Patchouli. I Love Musk. No Idea What This Is :-\&lt;br /&gt;I Do Not Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent from Spiritual Sky.  It&#x27;s the most fragrant.  It&#x27;s either you love it or hate it.  Try it out and see where you stand with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;MIFF</li>
            <li> Some of the best Pachouli that i have smelt out there for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for a few years, and I  get losts of comments about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this product to anyone that likes the smell of Patchouli and musk it&#x27;s an amazing smell!!!</li>
