            <li>Woderful product - great deal - fast delivery</li>

            <li>totally satisfied with all.  </li>
            <li>One of the best I have used and can use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommended</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>Keeps maturing hair full, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this new collection</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft, incredibly shiny, and very sleek.</li>
            <li>With Pantene Pro Shampoo, my hair is now full and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>The corresponding conditioner and the thickening treatment are OK, but I stopped using this shampoo within the first week.</li>
            <li>Works real well am enjoying using it</li>
            <li>I also love being able to order it in the larger size.</li>
            <li>Lovely lather, soft hair!</li>
            <li>appreciate the price and size of this offering, as it isn&#x27;t easy to find this size in most stores, and definitely not at this price.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and silky after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>With only a blow dryer and the Thickening Treatment, I now love my hair and the way it looks.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this shampoo but it left a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a heavier lather than I prefer (and generally trust) but the shampoo easily rinses out, leaves no residue and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>Yes it is purely cosmetic</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, feels like a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference</li>
            <li>read my other review buy :-)</li>
            <li>but when you don&#x27;t have the other options it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past [first tried it when it came out] and have been pleased with how my hair feels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my fine, slightly wavy hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>After just a few days my hair feels so much healthier and full.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable after using it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shinny</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, straight hair that falls just past my shoulders and this product really weighed it down.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this makes my hair full and soft.</li>
            <li>Pairing this with the other products in the line leaves my hair full of volume and helps to camoflauge the trouble spots.</li>

            <li> gives fuller body to your hair</li>

            <li> i use it reg. read my other review buy :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My hair was shiny and silky after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! My hair has become thinner over the past few years. I&#x27;m allergic to all of the hair growing products on the market so I have struggled to find something to boost my self-confidence. Pairing this with the other products in the line leaves my hair full of volume and helps to camoflauge the trouble spots. Yes it is purely cosmetic but when you don&#x27;t have the other options it&#x27;s fantastic! I also love being able to order it in the larger size.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and have never been able to get it to look like I wanted.  With Pantene Pro Shampoo, my hair is now full and easy to manage.  With only a blow dryer and the Thickening Treatment, I now love my hair and the way it looks.  I feel like I have been to a shop and had my hair done.  Love love love this new collection</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Please, please, please P&amp;G don&#x27;t ever stop making this product! I have very thick, coarse hair. This product makes my hair soft, incredibly shiny, and very sleek. I stopped using it when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally; my hair currently feels like it is made out of a broom :( I learned my lesson!</li>
            <li> Revitalizing shampoo for long and Chemical treated hair in my 40s</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo!! Leaves hair silky soft. After just a few days my hair feels so much healthier and full. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo (and the conditioner and thickening treatment)!  My hair is soft and manageable after using it.  Usually my hair is frizzy and dry.  Since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve received tons of complements about how great my hair looks.  I&#x27;m almost 50 and my hair looks and feels better than when I was 20.  Seriously - try it.  It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my fine, slightly wavy hair frizzy.  It only increased volume because of the frizz. The corresponding conditioner and the thickening treatment are OK, but I stopped using this shampoo within the first week.</li>
            <li> I am using the product because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money by throwing it away.  However, some sort of sheen or cream must be used to counteract the dryness left on the hair.</li>
            <li> Woderful product - great deal - fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past [first tried it when it came out] and have been pleased with how my hair feels.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the price and size of this offering, as it isn&#x27;t easy to find this size in most stores, and definitely not at this price.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! this shampoo! Also love the condition. I have thick, curly, graying hair and it does everything it say it promises. Can&#x27;t thank you enough!</li>
            <li> this is a just another great product from Pantene. I have thin hair and this makes my hair full and soft. a great product</li>
            <li> The Pantene AgeDefy collection is terrific.  Have used both shampoo and conditioner plus other AgeDefy products and have&lt;br /&gt;been totally satisfied with all.  Keeps maturing hair full, shiny and healthy.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works real well am enjoying using it</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this shampoo but it left a bit to be desired. It did leave my hair very soft and shiny but it was simply too heavy for my hair. I have baby fine, straight hair that falls just past my shoulders and this product really weighed it down. My hair felt greasy within a day of washing with this shampoo. It smelled nice, just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo.  One of the best I have used and can use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims. Must have in my shower.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shinny</li>
