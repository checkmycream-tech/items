    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I put the breast tape on and it stuck perfectly.</li>
            <li>this brand used to be really really good !</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews were not that great</li>
            <li>I think these will be great.</li>
            <li>WIFE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SUPPORT AND FIT ,PERFECT FOR THE BRALESS LOOK.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT</li>
            <li>I would suggest that if you&#x27;re an A to a C cup, these should work good for you.</li>
            <li>and my boobs looked like the good &#x27;ol days.  </li>
            <li>If the adhesive held better, this product would be great.</li>
            <li>Yup more weight on them!  </li>
            <li>The product is great and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Hollywood Fashion if you want the best.  </li>
            <li>but the picture is so compelling that I wonder how my breasts could not look as great as these with adhesive stuck on them?</li>
            <li>The product was received very quickly which was nice.  </li>
            <li>huge difference!</li>
            <li>Most of the products were messed up and folded.</li>
            <li>On top of all that it took over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li>I am a 32D and I love these.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have nothing on your skin or they won&#x27;t stick well.</li>
            <li>Really happy I did not invest much money into these.</li>
            <li>Love these...never have to worry bout clothing that doesn&#x27;t require a bra.</li>
            <li>The nipple covers are okay</li>
            <li>its the most stickies part</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>The lift is truly great, but the way they stick on: they poke out in places and it does not look smooth under the surface, the whole point is to avoid wearing a bra, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the same, it&#x27;s a cheap knock off at best.</li>
            <li>perfect for when you need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>inst strong and started to peel off.</li>
            <li>nipple covers work fine</li>
            <li>but thought I would give them a try since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>1 star only thing good was the nipple covers, the rest would tear easily</li>
            <li>your breast are clean (soap and water) before putting it on.</li>
            <li>I am a full B cup and these would not work at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t put it on right</li>
            <li>They definitely helped but with big boobs they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>They adhere fine but do nothing for real lift.</li>
            <li>Well cheap they really are, they do not stick at all.</li>
            <li>Would have returned them if it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li>: bigger boobs equals more weight right???</li>
            <li>but I really hope they work!</li>
            <li>for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I I purchased for (owner of a C cup), was quite pleased with the final result.</li>
            <li>My wife tried one of these, left it on for about an hour and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I still have two more left because i stopped using them after the first pair.</li>
            <li>Then I saw a video demonstration and i read the instructions (probably something I didnt do the first time)</li>
            <li>My boobs are too heavy for this product does not stick really good or lift.</li>
            <li>Plus I had to pull them up so high that the tape came above the tank top I was wearing.</li>
            <li>you are a C cup or larger, strongly encourage looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work on large breasts.</li>
            <li>Girls with large boobs beware.</li>
            <li>But I am large breasted.</li>
            <li>these things are pure junk.</li>
            <li>It was as if the glue was too old, or there was too much of it!!  </li>
            <li>These are not the real ones.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re risking there being too much weight put on the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t really know what I will do with them.  </li>
            <li>Very Sticky.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give you much cleavage on the top half.</li>
            <li>So even if the tape cup was big enough to fit the breast in the weight of them would peel the tape right off you.</li>
            <li>If you want the real deal, the product I described in my previous review then get the original &amp;#34;bring it</li>
            <li>Skin was clean and dry, would NOT recommend!!</li>
            <li>However, the adhesive appears to be very old because it feels gummy and does not adhere to skin at all.</li>
            <li>I, however, have extra skin from gaining and then losing 80lbs, and very large nipples so the flower pasties didn&#x27;t cover them completely.</li>
            <li>I think they are really designed for someone with a smaller bust.</li>
            <li>these are junk, took  month to get them and the adhesive is old</li>
            <li>Do not waste money and it came from China</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for women with D breast and bigger.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money your better off using medical tape or something else.</li>
            <li>completely not what I expected, doesn&#x27;t even fit my boobs.</li>
            <li>While these do help to make tops that I don&#x27;t want to wear a bra with a bit less obscene, they don&#x27;t really give me as much lift and support as I&#x27;d hoped they would.  </li>
            <li>And the clear part isn&#x27;t sticky not sturdy enough to hold you up.</li>
            <li>Barely sticks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very mad, cause I have this gorgeous sexy red dress that needs something other than a bra to peek through in the cleavage area! !</li>
            <li>Even if successfully done, the adhesive is terrible (even on clean, dry skin).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Even if successfully done, the adhesive is terrible (even on clean, dry skin).</li>
            <li> but its hard to get right when u have DD...</li>
            <li> These clear adhesive tapes were less sticky than using scotch tape.</li>
            <li> The adhesive didn&#x27;t even last while I was putting on the second one on my other breast.  </li>
            <li> I have size DD and haven&#x27;t actually worn these an entire night but the little time I did wear them they worked as well as they&#x27;re going to on boobs that big.</li>
            <li> : to small of a cup not fit your breast right</li>
            <li> I applied as the product description described and they only lasted for a minute before the tape started pulling away from my skin and fell down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at no fault of the seller or the product, I will be unable to use them because I have such stretchy skin on my boobs</li>
            <li> Again sorry it took me so long but better late than never I suppose.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to apply and really didn&#x27;t work the way I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> I have DD&#x27;s just for future reference, this does not work....not even a little.</li>
            <li> Taking the nipple covers was the most painful thing ever.</li>
            <li> Were not what I expected</li>
            <li> Adhesive not strong enough</li>
            <li> Maybe they would work for other women though.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative review I would, these do not work at all and are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I found this item in the bottom of my draw the other day &amp; remembered that I never corrected my previous review here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I figured, this time, I will use very minimal life as maybe my breasts are just heavy.</li>
            <li> They lift the lower half of my breasts.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be one of the few that these actually worked for, that&#x27;s why I gave it a chance despite the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The material they are made of is stiff and didn&#x27;t really form to the breast causing them to make a weird wrinkle/dent and peal off when you don&#x27;t want the to.</li>
            <li> I WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE TO GIVE NEGATIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> so just don&#x27;t waist the little money they cost.</li>
            <li> dont waste money</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> had to leave that thing on my nipple for a few days..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack off of amazon a few years ago.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get those little s***s off for anything!  </li>
            <li> I have small breast (b cup)</li>
            <li> I have small tits</li>
            <li> I was unable to use them personally,  </li>
            <li> Sorry to tell you ladies.......if you have bigger boobs,  don&#x27;t even think of getting anything like these.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I am sorry it took me so long to write this</li>
            <li> Very expensive for such a small quantity...</li>
            <li> Way too small; I didn&#x27;t use them because they didn&#x27;t do what they said they were going to do!</li>
            <li> : you will just have to leave these to the smaller chested girls :(</li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to put on and a little weird</li>
            <li> Product left a sticky residue on skin that was annoying to try and scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> She was not happy and neither was I.  </li>
            <li> but it was very painful around the nipple and the tape for the actual breast</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get imitation crap like this b/c</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> These are fake.</li>
            <li> Unless im doing it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap, scotch tape is stickier than this!</li>
            <li> They are also very difficult to work with and get placed correctly.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> They were so bad, I threw them away.</li>
            <li> so absolutely disappointed with the way i received this.</li>
            <li> How disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> These were awful.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> It makes it look all nasty and deformed shaped wrong.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> These were awful.  The adhesive did not last longer than two minutes!  It was as if the glue was too old, or there was too much of it!!  The adhesive didn&#x27;t even last while I was putting on the second one on my other breast.  I will never buy these specific ones again.</li>
            <li> 1 star only thing good was the nipple covers, the rest would tear easily</li>
            <li> so absolutely disappointed with the way i received this. Most of the products were messed up and folded. On top of all that it took over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to apply and really didn&#x27;t work the way I&#x27;d hoped.  I think they are really designed for someone with a smaller bust.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work on large breasts.</li>
            <li> it does not work as you think it would.</li>
            <li> didnt lift like I thought but I guess I was expecting it to lift like a bra and Im a C-D size. But worked well. Only dwn fall with anything that sticks to your body it slips when sweating.</li>
            <li> Purchased to wear with a backless shirt and they don&#x27;t work at all. I am a B cup and the adhesive did NOT stick, tried 2 different ones. Skin was clean and dry, would NOT recommend!!</li>
            <li> DID NOT STICK WELL only acted as nipple covers.. did not lift</li>
            <li> I am a 32D and I love these. They lift the lower half of my breasts. They don&#x27;t give you much cleavage on the top half.</li>
            <li> Fake. These are not the real ones. These are fake. Do not work. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I am a C cup and this did not hold my breast up at all. Barely sticks.</li>
            <li> They work! Wore on my bachelorette night, and my friends all got a kick watching me put them on, but they work! Be sure to have nothing on your skin or they won&#x27;t stick well.</li>
            <li> While these do help to make tops that I don&#x27;t want to wear a bra with a bit less obscene, they don&#x27;t really give me as much lift and support as I&#x27;d hoped they would.  They are also very difficult to work with and get placed correctly.</li>
            <li> dont hold. dont waste money</li>
            <li> Hope these are what I have been looking for I have not reviced them yet but I really hope they work!</li>
            <li> These clear adhesive tapes were less sticky than using scotch tape. Immediately after pulling into place, the tape ripped off and would not stick because now it had a layer of my skin on it.  I tried again, with another set of tapes. I figured, this time, I will use very minimal life as maybe my breasts are just heavy. Same result! Tape immediately stops being adhesive and I&#x27;m left with a piece of trash I can&#x27;t use. How disappointing!</li>
            <li> WIFE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SUPPORT AND FIT ,PERFECT FOR THE BRALESS LOOK.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT FOR SUMMER DRESSES, WILL BUY AGAIN .</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap, scotch tape is stickier than this! I have small breast (b cup) and they did not lift nor stick at all. Too bad I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product.  It was actually referred to me by a friend who is a B cup size, I am a C cup.  The adhesive would never stay in place.  It would begin to slip after about 5-10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;All instructions given were followed to the letter.  Product left a sticky residue on skin that was annoying to try and scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a C cup or larger, strongly encourage looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money these are junk, took  month to get them and the adhesive is old do your self a favor and go get a strapless there are alott of bras out there that you can purchase and get the same effect</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t work. I have small tits so I was very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Really happy I did not invest much money into these. I saw the reviews were not that great but thought I would give them a try since they are so cheap. Well cheap they really are, they do not stick at all. I am a full B cup and these would not work at all. I applied as the product description described and they only lasted for a minute before the tape started pulling away from my skin and fell down. Don&#x27;t waste your money your better off using medical tape or something else.</li>
            <li> This item does not stick well. If the adhesive held better, this product would be great. I don&#x27;t think cup size matters in relation to how sticky the tape is.</li>
            <li> Taking the nipple covers was the most painful thing ever. I used coconut oil to help ease the tape but it was very painful around the nipple and the tape for the actual breast inst strong and started to peel off.</li>
            <li> They do the job. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Girls with large boobs beware.</li>
            <li> These did the job, but the adhesive was not sticky enough.  I highly recommend Hollywood Fashion if you want the best.  I will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I have size DD and haven&#x27;t actually worn these an entire night but the little time I did wear them they worked as well as they&#x27;re going to on boobs that big. They definitely helped but with big boobs they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> The product was received very quickly which was nice.  However, the adhesive appears to be very old because it feels gummy and does not adhere to skin at all.</li>
            <li> Adhesive not strong enough</li>
            <li> The product is great and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I put the breast tape on and it stuck perfectly. I could tell that it would keep my girls in place. I, however, have extra skin from gaining and then losing 80lbs, and very large nipples so the flower pasties didn&#x27;t cover them completely. When I pushed my boobs up and taped them, I could see all my extra skin folded up under the tape. It was so gross looking! Plus I had to pull them up so high that the tape came above the tank top I was wearing. Unfortunately, at no fault of the seller or the product, I will be unable to use them because I have such stretchy skin on my boobs *sigh*. I would suggest that if you&#x27;re an A to a C cup, these should work good for you. Any larger than a C and you&#x27;re risking there being too much weight put on the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love these...never have to worry bout clothing that doesn&#x27;t require a bra.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do but I got them to wear with my Elvira costume and they showed while wearing it, they were shiney.  So, I don&#x27;t really know what I will do with them.  They are inexpensive so who knows, I may end up using them some day.</li>
            <li> Does not work for larger breasts</li>
            <li> completely not what I expected, doesn&#x27;t even fit my boobs.</li>
            <li> I am a 36C and I needed something that will give support for a low cut dress and this was definitely not the answer. I guess you&#x27;re supposed to fold the skin on your upper chest into itself to give an uplifted illusion but after several attempts, there still wasn&#x27;t enough support. Even if successfully done, the adhesive is terrible (even on clean, dry skin). I recommend a plunge bra instead: http://www.amazon.com/Sexy-Shape-Push-Plunge-Convertible/dp/B001OCPTDG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;apparel&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1410794172&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Sexy+V+Shape+Push+Up+Deep+Plunge+Convertible+V+BRA</li>
            <li> The lift is truly great, but the way they stick on: they poke out in places and it does not look smooth under the surface, the whole point is to avoid wearing a bra, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. But I am large breasted. So I found the ones for DD Plus size and ordered them. Neither worked for me. Maybe they would work for other women though. Very expensive for such a small quantity...and it&#x27;s ONLY tape! The company who sells these is greedy.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Do not waste money and it came from China took a month to receive. It deserves no stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a b cup and it only stayed lifted for 5.whole mins.</li>
            <li> The material they are made of is stiff and didn&#x27;t really form to the breast causing them to make a weird wrinkle/dent and peal off when you don&#x27;t want the to.</li>
            <li> nipple covers work fine but these tapes don&#x27;t lift larger breasts.  They adhere fine but do nothing for real lift.</li>
            <li> They were so bad, I threw them away.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product for those with A, B or C cup. I was unable to use them personally,  however the individual I I purchased for (owner of a C cup), was quite pleased with the final result.</li>
            <li> The nipple covers are okay although The breast support  doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Boo. I was disappointed. They didn&#x27;t stick well, provided no lift or support, chucked them in the bin. Would have returned them if it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Very Sticky. Can get caught on itself. Doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for women with D breast and bigger.</li>
            <li> I only received the nipple covers. I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wear a Size D 32. My boobs are too heavy for this product does not stick really good or lift. Unless im doing it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> It was horrible! It didnt even stick and the part you put on the actual nipple its the most stickies part I tried taking it off had to leave that thing on my nipple for a few days..Water barley helps.And the clear part isn&#x27;t sticky not sturdy enough to hold you up.And im only in my B cups.</li>
            <li> Does not hold ,not sticky enough</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way I thought it would had.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative review I would, these do not work at all and are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> this brand used to be really really good ! They changed the tape they used and doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!!!!doesnt stick to skin doesn&#x27;t hold you up! Doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used nipple covers before but I don&#x27;t think these are sticky enough. They&#x27;re okay but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but tried them once with a sleeveless dress and my boobs looked like the good &#x27;ol days.  Stuck well but no problem removing them.  No residue.  I think these will be great.</li>
            <li> My wife tried one of these, left it on for about an hour and was pleased with the results.  However, another day she tried one and left it on for several hours (approcximately the time of an evening out).  When she removed it later it tore her skin in three places.  She still has sores and scabs on her breasts.  She was not happy and neither was I.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> perfect for when you need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack off of amazon a few years ago. I still have two more left because i stopped using them after the first pair. It didnt work nor was it sticky enough. Then I saw a video demonstration and i read the instructions (probably something I didnt do the first time) MAKE SURE your breast are clean (soap and water) before putting it on. I had lotioned up before putting them on so that was my problem. When I tried it again years later my breast had no product on them AT ALL! Then it worked like a charm! I&#x27;m a C cup, and it worked wonders for me! huge difference! i&#x27;m going to buy them in bulk for the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t put it on right but even so it held well. They are a bit difficult to put on and a little weird but they didn&#x27;t come off during that dancing at prom!</li>
            <li> I WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE TO GIVE NEGATIVE STARS! I followed the instructions and they didn&#x27;t even stick. What a waste of money. The pasties that came with worked well, maybe too well? I couldn&#x27;t get those little s***s off for anything!  I thought I&#x27;d be one of the few that these actually worked for, that&#x27;s why I gave it a chance despite the negative reviews. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on this product a few years ago. I must find out how to retract it b/c I these things are pure junk. I am sorry it took me so long to write this but I found this item in the bottom of my draw the other day &amp; remembered that I never corrected my previous review here on Amazon. My apologizes. If you want the real deal, the product I described in my previous review then get the original &amp;#34;bring it up&amp;#34; tape. Don&#x27;t get imitation crap like this b/c it&#x27;s not the same, it&#x27;s a cheap knock off at best. Again sorry it took me so long but better late than never I suppose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.  Go get pasties instead.</li>
            <li> not working, glue is gone in all of them</li>
            <li> Sorry to tell you ladies.......if you have bigger boobs,  don&#x27;t even think of getting anything like these.&lt;br /&gt;1: to small of a cup not fit your breast right, we all know that from experience. It makes it look all nasty and deformed shaped wrong.&lt;br /&gt;2: bigger boobs equals more weight right??? Yup more weight on them!  So even if the tape cup was big enough to fit the breast in the weight of them would peel the tape right off you. .&lt;br /&gt;..ouch!&lt;br /&gt;3: you will just have to leave these to the smaller chested girls :( I&#x27;m sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very mad, cause I have this gorgeous sexy red dress that needs something other than a bra to peek through in the cleavage area! !</li>
            <li> it holds up yes. but its hard to get right when u have DD...so just don&#x27;t waist the little money they cost.</li>
            <li> Were not what I expected</li>
            <li> I have DD&#x27;s just for future reference, this does not work....not even a little.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, I haven&#x27;t tried these yet but the picture is so compelling that I wonder how my breasts could not look as great as these with adhesive stuck on them?</li>
            <li> Way too small; I didn&#x27;t use them because they didn&#x27;t do what they said they were going to do!</li>
