            <li>biggest handle of this product which seems very lightly made is its handle which looks in the picture to be substantial  </li>
            <li>It is made very cheaply, even for women&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased these scissors.  </li>
            <li>will have to keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li>So, on one level I&#x27;m sincerely grateful this product helped me with this task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably the best item I have purchased for myself in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise OK and do the job fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sturdy construction made them easy to manage.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use the right for both feet easily.</li>
            <li>This really works I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>and I was able with difficulty to use with some success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a hip replacement the end of June and these scissors have come in very handy since I can&#x27;t cut my toenails with regular clippers like I use to.  </li>
            <li>This are perfect for getting my toenails, that otherwise I find hard to reach.</li>
            <li>They took a while to arrive, since they ship from the UK, but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>these scissors might help you, For me it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and leave a nice smooth edge on nails.</li>
            <li>My right hand has an easier time with scissors</li>
            <li>Then I found these scissors which help a lot with the reach to the right toes.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using these scissors, they are easy to manage and make a clean sharp cut.  </li>
            <li>Item&#x27;s and as many of such items that I&#x27;ve found our slim.  </li>
            <li>So, I would imagine that most woman and men with smaller hands might not find this as bothersome.  </li>
            <li>These long handled toe nail scissors work even better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have unusually large hands</li>
            <li>Twenty more words would be gushing, so I&#x27;ll just babble until I&#x27;ve reached your purely arbitrary required word count.</li>
            <li>again nothing unusual.  </li>
            <li>The scissors work very well.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Pakistan\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping charge is high.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 4 major spine surgeries the first being at the age of 15 and</li>
            <li>These made it easy and simple and I can reach all my toes and the handles are big enough for my hands,which are destroyed by the RA.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it was over Christmas but that still seems very long for first class from Illinois to New Mexico.</li>
            <li>They far surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>Arthritis makes it hard for me to bring my leg up to get at toenails easily.</li>
            <li>not long enough; handle not comfortable or easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They were not sharp at all and didn&#x27;t even cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, even though I think the design could be improved upon significantly in the handle if you have a medical condition that makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to your toe nails</li>
            <li>These scissors barely cut.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone who is having problems even if your nails are thick they will cut right through them.</li>
            <li>But with my hands and fingers being cramped in this hard plastic environment significantly added to the discomfort of the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far the only downside was that it took several weeks for the scissos to arrive from England</li>
            <li>I am parylyzed with very little feeling on my right side from a stroke.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to hold the right toes steady and cut the toenails with a clipper in the left hand.</li>
            <li>This makes any kind of shearing action impossible.</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t need to juggle a nail clipper for the right toes as the scissors cut well, even for nails that are very thick and the nail clipper kept slipping off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are probably bigger average but</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how how well it cuts even thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a second pair for my son who has a medical issue and makes it hard for him to reach his toes!</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND, FOR ANYONE WHO CAN NOT BEND OVER DUE TO JOINT ISSUSES.</li>
            <li> Handles could be just a little longer.  </li>
            <li> If you have trouble reaching you toes</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the piece that holds my thumb is too small,  it hurts when my thumb is squeezed, would not recommend these</li>
            <li> I have bad knees, which don&#x27;t bend easily, which makes trimming my nails difficult.</li>
            <li> In all fairness this is a specialty designed for those who have trouble cutting their toenails for medical issues like Arthritis.</li>
            <li> Dull too.</li>
            <li> Was hoping these scissors would help me cut my toenails however, they are dull and don&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li> as I have a hard time  bending over, these did the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with one side in regards to bending and the scissors seemed like it&#x27;s made for only one way in regards to cutting your toe nails.</li>
            <li> but the holes are narrow and hard which I find uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Arthritis makes it impossible to reach my toenails with regular length toenail clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The joint is so weak that the blades spread apart even on fingernails.</li>
            <li> If it were a bit longer I thinking at least in my case would have made the task less painful.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably poor quality.</li>
            <li> With my RA it is hard to handle toe nail clippers and scissors and especially hard to do what I need to do.  </li>
            <li> But I would encourage improvements in the design of the handle which I find quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was a very poor purchase.</li>
            <li> did not close together when cutting my toenails.</li>
            <li> Because of spinal surgeries and bad hips and knees, I can no longer reach my toe nails.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad hip and can not reach them.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this scissors.</li>
            <li> They are of HORRIBLE quality.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arthritis makes it hard for me to bring my leg up to get at toenails easily. Got to my nails with precision and ease with these scissors. My right hand has an easier time with scissors and I was able to use the right for both feet easily.</li>
            <li> I have back problems and can not reach my left toes, this is the reason I ordered this...  I am very satisfied with this product..</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased these scissors.  Finally I am able to reach my feet and clip my own nails.</li>
            <li> Arthritis makes it impossible to reach my toenails with regular length toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These scissors gave me the extra length I needed to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy construction made them easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I love them!  They far surpassed my expectations. Twenty more words would be gushing, so I&#x27;ll just babble until I&#x27;ve reached your purely arbitrary required word count.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably poor quality. There must be 2 different models they are sending out because nobody would give the pair I got 5 (or 4, 3 or 2) stars. The joint is so weak that the blades spread apart even on fingernails. This makes any kind of shearing action impossible. Dull too.</li>
            <li> These long handled toe nail scissors work even better than I had hoped. I have bad knees, which don&#x27;t bend easily, which makes trimming my nails difficult. These scissors help me do so with ease. The serrated edge on the one side really does help by holding the nail firmly while being cut. They took a while to arrive, since they ship from the UK, but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> was a gift and have not spoken to recipient to ask if he likes the way they work or not</li>
            <li> Because of spinal surgeries and bad hips and knees, I can no longer reach my toe nails. This toe nail scissors helps a lot. I was surprised at how how well it cuts even thick toe nails. Very impressive.</li>
            <li> I just received these scissors.  They are of HORRIBLE quality.  They are not even sharpened (beveled); just two flat pieces of steel.  The seams from molding the plastic handles are not even smoothed: the handles cut into my fingers.  The sharpness inside the handles may well surpass the \\&quot;sharpness\\&quot; of the blades.  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone answered a question saying their scissors were made in Britain.  Mine are stamped \\&quot;Pakistan\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping charge is high.  The shipment took 14 days.  Yes, it was over Christmas but that still seems very long for first class from Illinois to New Mexico.</li>
            <li> not long enough; handle not comfortable or easy to hold. would not buy again. will have to keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I am parylyzed with very little feeling on my right side from a stroke. I used to be right-handed. It was very hard to hold the right toes steady and cut the toenails with a clipper in the left hand. The toes would not stay in place. Then I found these scissors which help a lot with the reach to the right toes. I&#x27;m still doing trial and error but I don&#x27;t need to juggle a nail clipper for the right toes as the scissors cut well, even for nails that are very thick and the nail clipper kept slipping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the only downside was that it took several weeks for the scissos to arrive from England and I could not find the equivalent scissors made in the USA. If you have trouble reaching you toes these scissors might help you, For me it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all for me at all.  It was a waste of money. It was a very poor purchase.</li>
            <li> Was hoping these scissors would help me cut my toenails however, they are dull and don&#x27;t cut well.  Also, took over 6 weeks to arrive</li>
            <li> The Toe Nail Scissors work great.  as I have a hard time  bending over, these did the trick.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Probably the best item I have purchased for myself in a long time.  With my RA it is hard to handle toe nail clippers and scissors and especially hard to do what I need to do.  These made it easy and simple and I can reach all my toes and the handles are big enough for my hands,which are destroyed by the RA.  I am ordering a second pair for my son who has a medical issue and makes it hard for him to reach his toes!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something that I could cut my toenails for a long time. I have a very bad hip and can not reach them. This really works I am thrilled. I highly recommend them to anyone who is having problems even if your nails are thick they will cut right through them. They are awesome</li>
            <li> the piece that holds my thumb is too small,  it hurts when my thumb is squeezed, would not recommend these</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these scissors, they are easy to manage and make a clean sharp cut.  Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li> These are very very cheaply made. did not close together when cutting my toenails. would not recommend or buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> These scissors barely cut.  I bought them for an elderly person to cut toenails.  They were not sharp at all and didn&#x27;t even cut</li>
            <li> In all fairness this is a specialty designed for those who have trouble cutting their toenails for medical issues like Arthritis. Item&#x27;s and as many of such items that I&#x27;ve found our slim.  That being said.  Bear in mind that I only received this item yesterday and I was able with difficulty to use with some success.  I&#x27;ve had 4 major spine surgeries the first being at the age of 15 and now a great deal of my spine is fused.  So, on one level I&#x27;m sincerely grateful this product helped me with this task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest handle of this product which seems very lightly made is its handle which looks in the picture to be substantial  but the holes are narrow and hard which I find uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t have unusually large hands but they are probably bigger average but again nothing unusual.  So, I would imagine that most woman and men with smaller hands might not find this as bothersome.  But with my hands and fingers being cramped in this hard plastic environment significantly added to the discomfort of the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how long it last.  But I would encourage improvements in the design of the handle which I find quite uncomfortable.  And in my case and I didn&#x27;t take this account the number of stars because my spine is so atypical.  If it were a bit longer I thinking at least in my case would have made the task less painful.  But my biggest tribe is in the design of the handle which is not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m grateful that I was able to even accomplish this task as opposed to having to pay someone to asking for a awkward favor or paying someone to cut my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I think the design could be improved upon significantly in the handle if you have a medical condition that makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to your toe nails I would suggest you consider trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out their finds a vastly superior product I&#x27;d love to hear about it and I may revive my review in time depending on how it holds up.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR LONGER REACH, DOES NOT CUT THICKER NAILS WELL. I WOULD RECOMMEND, FOR ANYONE WHO CAN NOT BEND OVER DUE TO JOINT ISSUSES.</li>
            <li> The scissors work very well.  They are sharp and leave a nice smooth edge on nails.</li>
            <li> Took these to my foot doctor.  She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> Handles could be just a little longer.  Otherwise OK and do the job fine.</li>
            <li> I suffer from arthritis, so thought this would be great. I was very disappointed in this scissors. It is made very cheaply, even for women&#x27;s hands. I have problems with one side in regards to bending and the scissors seemed like it&#x27;s made for only one way in regards to cutting your toe nails. The company that sells it, also charged a ridiculous S&amp;H charge (almost as much as the scissors).</li>
            <li> With limited mobility, these long handled toe nail scissors are life savers for me. They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hip replacement the end of June and these scissors have come in very handy since I can&#x27;t cut my toenails with regular clippers like I use to.  Nice</li>
            <li> This are perfect for getting my toenails, that otherwise I find hard to reach. If you are arthritic or overweight (as I am) these are great!</li>
