            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the brow gloss.</li>
            <li>but then I started to notice my eyebrows changing and becoming more dry/brittle.</li>
            <li>The hold is pretty good finishes kinda fast but still good, I also have eye allergies, and experiences no itching etc</li>
            <li>So far it works great, however it started to turn brown after two uses.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m never going to spend much more for it because its not that important to me.</li>
            <li>but wow its a great brow gloss.</li>
            <li>Love how cheap it is and the fact that it is vegan.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really hold your lashes well but works good for eye brows</li>
            <li>It washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It gives me nice long seperated lashes without the color and keeps my brows neat and tidy!</li>
            <li>Everything was fine with the packaging.</li>
            <li>i like this product because it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and a must have.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try out this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s this guy&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent clear mascara, look no further!</li>
            <li>(Linda Evangelista special merit badge).</li>
            <li>The mascara does not makke your eyelashes longer or thicker, but it makes them more neat and gives the impression that your lashes are naturally long and tidy.</li>
            <li>Anyway I love it so much</li>
            <li>I bought two because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Clumpy and runs out quickly, but overall good product.</li>
            <li>Next time I would buy this product from Target though because its only $2 there, but great product!</li>
            <li>It does run out fairly quick</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t tried many other brow gels</li>
            <li>Great product at half the price ....</li>
            <li>good stuff but not very much in the container</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s clear and dries quick.</li>
            <li>I love the eyebrow side because it keeps my eyebrows in place and there is no dried residue or evidence that I have any product in them.</li>
            <li>I liked this product alot, I only used the eyebrow gel side.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is good for if you want a more subtle look than to have black mascara on your eyebrows, and it works great to seal brow make up as well.</li>
            <li>but I think the dollar is worth it just for the brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a way more natural look.  </li>
            <li>I also find that when touching lashes or brows after putting this product on you notice that they feel fairly soft.</li>
            <li>But other then that it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I also could never apply the right amount of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it goes really really fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the lash gel because I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>this product woks pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat over my mascara on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li>Although I am no proponent of wastefulness, it&#x27;s far better than risking an eye infection, and it&#x27;s cheap enough that this practice is reasonable in terms of both hygiene and monetary cost.</li>
            <li>great , very small amount</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying anything from e.l.f directly off of their website, they usually have awesome deals buying directly anyways.</li>
            <li>Love this for my long, curly eyebrows.</li>
            <li>okay ,it dried up pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay for your lashes, but again it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, I just wish there was more gloss!</li>
            <li>I really like how it keeps my eyebrows in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>It made my eyebrows look really defined.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference with it or without.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>It works very well for this &amp; the eyelash gel works just as well.</li>
            <li>I know people say not to use mascara beyond, like, four months, but does anyone really do that?</li>
            <li>I would NEVER use this on my eyelashes solely for the fact that the clear gel gets murky with foundation after the first use and the wand is pretty much just a pipe cleaner.</li>
            <li>But the eye last kind works for both, so I&#x27;m not entirely upset...</li>
            <li>I feel so confident when I wear natural products that produce &amp;#34;me, only better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>comes off when wet easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but it doesn&#x27;t give me the long lasting effect that I want for a brow gel</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat over my dark mascara and it helps it last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind a refund tho or a new product sent</li>
            <li>its also very tiny and runs out very fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your lashes or your brows feeling sticky or dry, and it keeps them all lovely and in order all day long.</li>
            <li>like to crush my favorite, hard to find brow- powder &amp; mini-funnel into one clear end &amp; mix it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t show up</li>
            <li>If you need/want a clear mascara/eyebrow gel...get this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is really even essential</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever found to really keep them in place it is my holy grail eyebrow product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this too much because my penciled in eye brow color did not stay in place once I brushed this over them.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for lashes though, which is why I only gave it four stars</li>
            <li>This darkens and differentiates my eyelashes, making them appear lengthened, but I love that it&#x27;s basically just my eyelashes, you know what I mean?</li>
            <li>Never even used it don&#x27;t really like the smell other people who use it mainly use it for the eyebrows and seem to like it</li>
            <li>one side was pretty much empty -_-</li>
            <li>The only downside I have is that it got very cloudy on my fourth use</li>
            <li>I recently tried the Maybelline clear gel but that was rubbish compared to this.</li>
            <li>If you have Wal-Mart near you, it&#x27;s only $2 there.</li>
            <li>I expected it to at least make my lashes LOOK a tad better.</li>
            <li>This is better than other mascaras and brow gels that make your lashes and brows feel hard clumpy and or sometimes sticky.</li>
            <li>It gets really gunked up with whatever I previously had on my brows before setting it with this.</li>
            <li>Really cool brow product, but even used sparingly very small amount lasts weeks</li>
            <li>I do, however, use the clear mascara if I&#x27;m going for a really natural look because it does make a little bit of a difference.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind a refund tho or a new product sent</li>
            <li> its also very tiny and runs out very fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your lashes or your brows feeling sticky or dry, and it keeps them all lovely and in order all day long.</li>
            <li> like to crush my favorite, hard to find brow- powder &amp; mini-funnel into one clear end &amp; mix it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t show up</li>
            <li> If you need/want a clear mascara/eyebrow gel...get this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really even essential</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever found to really keep them in place it is my holy grail eyebrow product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this too much because my penciled in eye brow color did not stay in place once I brushed this over them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for lashes though, which is why I only gave it four stars</li>
            <li> This darkens and differentiates my eyelashes, making them appear lengthened, but I love that it&#x27;s basically just my eyelashes, you know what I mean?</li>
            <li> Never even used it don&#x27;t really like the smell other people who use it mainly use it for the eyebrows and seem to like it</li>
            <li> one side was pretty much empty -_-</li>
            <li> The only downside I have is that it got very cloudy on my fourth use</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Maybelline clear gel but that was rubbish compared to this.</li>
            <li> If you have Wal-Mart near you, it&#x27;s only $2 there.</li>
            <li> I expected it to at least make my lashes LOOK a tad better.</li>
            <li> This is better than other mascaras and brow gels that make your lashes and brows feel hard clumpy and or sometimes sticky.</li>
            <li> It gets really gunked up with whatever I previously had on my brows before setting it with this.</li>
            <li> Really cool brow product, but even used sparingly very small amount lasts weeks</li>
            <li> I do, however, use the clear mascara if I&#x27;m going for a really natural look because it does make a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing I can say about it is that I ran out of it so quickly and if anybody knows where you can get just the full tube of elf eyebrow gel without the eyelash gel can you please email me at galyaseidel0967@gmail.com</li>
            <li> The other wand, I leave clear.</li>
            <li> Long story short:</li>
            <li> and you eyelashes feel fake but it is easy to come off.</li>
            <li> Not very conditioning compared to another I&#x27;m using for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Only drawback which is to be expected is that brow product gets into the tube and discolors the rest of the product if you use it to set the hairs in place like I do.</li>
            <li> it also takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I have sparse, short lashes, so I rely on regular mascara to give them a little boost in appearance.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get to use it very long before it was gone..</li>
            <li> The product seems to be melted and the brush is completely dry there was no product inside.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to constantly wipe black from undery eyes.</li>
            <li> have a kit double the cost that Is still complimented by a a feather of a touch from this little wonder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this, a little skeptical because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li> and it came in a pink package</li>
            <li> but other than that it did the job.</li>
            <li> I do like e.l.f products so this does not steer me away from their other items.</li>
            <li> They lost their dark coloring and thickness.</li>
            <li> I know I use products until they are dried up or empty, without issue...</li>
            <li> It seemed either my brows would be very wet looking and stiff from product as in</li>
            <li> Little think to me.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and then stopped.</li>
            <li> I think this product either contains harsh alcohol or builds up over time.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t messy to apply.</li>
            <li> Trash this after a few  months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> anyway, I recently pulled this out and used the non-murky and weird side of the gloss, and lo and behold</li>
            <li> This stuff kind of turned bad and smelled and looked awful after a couple weeks gross.</li>
            <li> I have really thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wouldn&#x27;t for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I just hate that I paid for when it was only a dollar at Walmart</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m aiming for a Girl-Scout Badge in Eyebrow Game</li>
            <li> Killer Eyebrow Game.</li>
            <li> For $1 you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brow mascara duo.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, a bit expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> Wrong Product Was Sent, In Its Place Was A Eye Shadow Compact Instead.</li>
            <li> i put it on my eyebrows, and they felt extremely numb and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a factory defect, but it is definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> then it starts smelling really bad</li>
            <li> But Was Disappointed Not To Get This Product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Clumpy and runs out quickly, but overall good product.</li>
            <li> its okay ,it dried up pretty quick.  but other than that it did the job.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and does the job!  I use it as a top coat over my dark mascara and it helps it last much longer.  I don&#x27;t have to constantly wipe black from undery eyes.</li>
            <li> The product came in 5 days which was awesome and it came in a pink package and I don&#x27;t know I thought that was cute. I really like how it keeps my eyebrows in place throughout the day. The only downside I have is that it got very cloudy on my fourth use and I don&#x27;t even use any eyebrow powder I only use the elf alone. But still it&#x27;s still a really good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Like it don&#x27;t love it it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I love this product and use every day I just hate that I paid for when it was only a dollar at Walmart</li>
            <li> its ok i guess, i was looking for one that would make my eyelashes darker but it didnt do anything. it also takes a long time to dry. i put it on my eyebrows, and they felt extremely numb and fuzzy. its also very tiny and runs out very fast. i dont think i will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> great , very small amount</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really even essential lol honestly, it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with the packaging. It came on time. The quality is great! One application and my eyebrows stayed in place all day! Next time I would buy this product from Target though because its only $2 there, but great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff kind of turned bad and smelled and looked awful after a couple weeks gross.</li>
            <li> The eyelash side is perfect, but the eyebrow side wouldn&#x27;t screw. After using pliers, I was able to get the brush out of the eyebrow side. The product seems to be melted and the brush is completely dry there was no product inside. I don&#x27;t know if this is a factory defect, but it is definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought this, a little skeptical because of the cheap price. I love the eyebrow side because it keeps my eyebrows in place and there is no dried residue or evidence that I have any product in them. I like the eyelash side too, but I don&#x27;t use it daily. I have sparse, short lashes, so I rely on regular mascara to give them a little boost in appearance. I do, however, use the clear mascara if I&#x27;m going for a really natural look because it does make a little bit of a difference. Use it with an eyelash curler and it will help even more. Overall, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Came to my house and the eye brow side was cracked and leaked. A week went by and the entire eyebrow liquid leaked out and no longe is usable. But the eye last kind works for both, so I&#x27;m not entirely upset... I wouldn&#x27;t mind a refund tho or a new product sent</li>
            <li> So far it works great, however it started to turn brown after two uses. No big deal, it could just be the NYX powder I use comes off when wet easily. Anyway I love it so much I went to the actual ELF website and bought it there for only $1 each. I bought two because I love it so much. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you just can&#x27;t find anywhere. When I found the combination of 2 for 1 I was thrilled. The price was below fair. Service was great.</li>
            <li> I have really thick eyebrows and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever found to really keep them in place it is my holy grail eyebrow product the only bad thing I can say about it is that I ran out of it so quickly and if anybody knows where you can get just the full tube of elf eyebrow gel without the eyelash gel can you please email me at galyaseidel0967@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I do like this, especially for the price. I use it exclusively on my brows. It gets really gunked up with whatever I previously had on my brows before setting it with this. It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed perfect eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really hold your lashes well but works good for eye brows</li>
            <li> Really cool brow product, but even used sparingly very small amount lasts weeks</li>
            <li> I really like the product but I didn&#x27;t get to use it very long before it was gone..it goes really really fast! I would recommend buying anything from e.l.f directly off of their website, they usually have awesome deals buying directly anyways.</li>
            <li> This is a winner. It doesn&#x27;t leave your lashes or your brows feeling sticky or dry, and it keeps them all lovely and in order all day long. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I used this as a eyebrow tamer and it does a nice job of keeping my eyebrows neat and in place without leaving it flaky.&lt;br /&gt;Nice buy</li>
            <li> Perfect what I needed</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I use this on my eyebrows after shaping them.  Love that it&#x27;s clear and dries quick.</li>
            <li> one side was pretty much empty -_-</li>
            <li> Good product good for pre teens</li>
            <li> I love it, I always use it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  SAW A YOUTUBER USE IT AND DECIDED TO GET ONE AND IT MADE DOING EYEBROWS SO MUCH BETTER. ESPECIALLY SINCE MINE ARE A BIT CURLY AND IS A PAIN TO STAY IN PLACE</li>
            <li> Not the best. Kinda clumpy after a while. Little think to me. Not very conditioning compared to another I&#x27;m using for about the same price.</li>
            <li> The brow gel is nice for setting my brow pencil marks, or for keeping those stray hairs in place. I&#x27;m not crazy about the lash gel because I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all. Only drawback which is to be expected is that brow product gets into the tube and discolors the rest of the product if you use it to set the hairs in place like I do. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to keep hairs in place/an alternative to makeup, maybe try this out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot, I only used the eyebrow gel side.  It made my eyebrows look really defined.  Need to order more</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this too much because my penciled in eye brow color did not stay in place once I brushed this over them. I guess it&#x27;s okay for your lashes, but again it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. I used it a few times and then stopped. It just didn&#x27;t work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wouldn&#x27;t for anyone else. For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try. I do like e.l.f products so this does not steer me away from their other items.</li>
            <li> This is a great gloss for brows! I use it everyday, I just wish there was more gloss! It doesn&#x27;t really work for lashes though, which is why I only gave it four stars</li>
            <li> For $1 you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brow mascara duo. It gives me nice long seperated lashes without the color and keeps my brows neat and tidy! I like!</li>
            <li> good stuff but not very much in the container</li>
            <li> I am in love with the brow gloss, it keeps my eyebrows nice and tidy whenever I do my makeup, not too impressed with the clear mascara though, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference with it or without.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this in the mail. I was happy to try it and it turns out it works out awesome and it makes your eyes look big which I like. The only thing is that is hardens your eyelashes when your wearing it for a while and you eyelashes feel fake but it is easy to come off. But other then that it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This is good for if you want a more subtle look than to have black mascara on your eyebrows, and it works great to seal brow make up as well.</li>
            <li> Never even used it don&#x27;t really like the smell other people who use it mainly use it for the eyebrows and seem to like it I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Does an ok job. Doesn&#x27;t hold them n place like I would like but works for a softer look</li>
            <li> It runs out fast though, the brow side lasted me a few weeks...but it makes my brows look nice &amp; in shape.</li>
            <li> This gel did the job , but dried out kinda fast...</li>
            <li> I have not tried this on my eye lashes. I don&#x27;t see the point unless you are going for the \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look. I do use it on my eye brows after I fill them in. Works great for the price. It does run out fairly quick but I think the dollar is worth it just for the brush. I honestly haven&#x27;t tried many other brow gels but I&#x27;m never going to spend much more for it because its not that important to me.</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this product, that is how much I love it! I only use it to set my eyebrows in place - both ends can be used to this end and it works great! It&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t show up and it&#x27;s $1 on the ELF website! After a while, the gel can start getting murky/brownish, but at $1 you can just buy a replacement. I&#x27;ll keep repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> Great product at half the price .... thank you!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, a bit expensive on Amazon but eh. The hold is pretty good finishes kinda fast but still good, I also have eye allergies, and experiences no itching etc</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for the longest time but then I started to notice my eyebrows changing and becoming more dry/brittle. They lost their dark coloring and thickness. I think this product either contains harsh alcohol or builds up over time. I also could never apply the right amount of this stuff. It seemed either my brows would be very wet looking and stiff from product as in they looked like I gelled them to death or they&#x27;d be ashy and covered in white dandruff looking flakes. I couldn&#x27;t win towards the end and thus discontinued use..</li>
            <li> Wonderfull product !!</li>
            <li> I like it! Finally my eyebrows stay in place.</li>
            <li> This works! I comb my eyebrows upwards to get an uplifting effect; I have hooded eyes. It doesn&#x27;t leave any film or residue. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows stick together or fall out. It isn&#x27;t messy to apply. It washes off easily. I like this product and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> this product woks pretty well for the price. my eyebrows stay on for most of the day depending on activity and i can sometimes sleep with my brows still on</li>
            <li> i like this product because it&#x27;s light.  it doesn&#x27;t streak or clump lashes with a lot of color.  it&#x27;s a way more natural look.  love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to keep my stray eyebrow hairs in place. It works very well for this &amp; the eyelash gel works just as well. I use te eyelash gel alone on my bottom lashes &amp; I use it as a top coat over my mascara on my upper lashes. I would recommend this product and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this product. The mascara does not makke your eyelashes longer or thicker, but it makes them more neat and gives the impression that your lashes are naturally long and tidy. The brow gel works great for keepinf your brows in place neatly. I also find that when touching lashes or brows after putting this product on you notice that they feel fairly soft. This is better than other mascaras and brow gels that make your lashes and brows feel hard clumpy and or sometimes sticky. I love this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Cheap and a must have. If you need/want a clear mascara/eyebrow gel...get this product.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and works great!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Use daily</li>
            <li> Works good until 3 weeks then it starts smelling really bad</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t keep my eyebrows in place at all.</li>
            <li> Temporary use but recommend</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the brow gloss. Have not used it as a mascara but wow its a great brow gloss.</li>
            <li> I am re-purchasing this because it works wonderfully on my eyelashes. If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent clear mascara, look no further! This darkens and differentiates my eyelashes, making them appear lengthened, but I love that it&#x27;s basically just my eyelashes, you know what I mean? I feel so confident when I wear natural products that produce &amp;#34;me, only better&amp;#34; status.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave this four stars is because one side of the product turned murky and flesh-colored after about six months. I know people say not to use mascara beyond, like, four months, but does anyone really do that? I know I use products until they are dried up or empty, without issue... anyway, I recently pulled this out and used the non-murky and weird side of the gloss, and lo and behold, I have a stye on my bottom eyelid. Pretty sure it&#x27;s this guy&#x27;s fault. Long story short: Trash this after a few  months. Although I am no proponent of wastefulness, it&#x27;s far better than risking an eye infection, and it&#x27;s cheap enough that this practice is reasonable in terms of both hygiene and monetary cost.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well as a brow gel. It&#x27;s not terrible but it doesn&#x27;t give me the long lasting effect that I want for a brow gel</li>
            <li> Everything about this is perfect except that it runs out of product very quickly. I actually only use this for my brows so I end up using the eyelash end once the eyebrow end runs out of product. they definitely feel different but both get the job done. Love how cheap it is and the fact that it is vegan.</li>
            <li> Love this for my long, curly eyebrows. Keeps them in place. I would NEVER use this on my eyelashes solely for the fact that the clear gel gets murky with foundation after the first use and the wand is pretty much just a pipe cleaner. I would be terrified of putting that next to my eye. Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my eye brows in line and to lock in eye brow pencil. Works great. If you have Wal-Mart near you, it&#x27;s only $2 there.</li>
            <li> Bomb nation, up in your makeup station.&lt;br /&gt;I have a kit double the cost that Is still complimented by a a feather of a touch from this little wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to crush my favorite, hard to find brow- powder &amp; mini-funnel into one clear end &amp; mix it. The other wand, I leave clear. This allows me to get from fresh/youthful or defined/ pinup looks quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s SO inexpensive I get four at a time &amp; throw in purses &amp; cars&amp; desks- like I&#x27;m aiming for a Girl-Scout Badge in Eyebrow Game (Linda Evangelista special merit badge). She was arching when Cara Delivgne was another Beatle-Browed Beauty  in a diaper. Respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Killer Eyebrow Game. #the struggle.</li>
            <li> The Brow side holds well....but the mascara side was blah. I expected it to at least make my lashes LOOK a tad better. But you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it. Won&#x27;t make this mistake again. Stick to regular mascara</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I always fill in my eyebrows and whenever I use this to set it, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or budge all day until I wash my face.  It really is awesome.  i just wish they made it in a bigger tube.  I recently tried the Maybelline clear gel but that was rubbish compared to this.</li>
            <li> Wrong Product Was Sent, In Its Place Was A Eye Shadow Compact Instead. Didn&#x27;t Mind But Was Disappointed Not To Get This Product</li>
