            <li>I purchased this combo because my hairdresser suggested it and said it was the best shampoo/conditioner she has used.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner and it makes my curly hair look so good.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo for for color hold.  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice too</li>
            <li>Loved the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>One good thing...</li>
            <li>Bamboo UV+ Color Shampoo and Conditioner set is the best sulfate free hair products I have found.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave a sample of the product to me and I purchased for my own use.</li>
            <li>This product is the best solution so far.</li>
            <li>I liked their Caviar line better.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, shampoo seemed to work great however with the conditioner it seems like you needed alot of it.  </li>
            <li>This created volume and a healthy feel.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Also, the shampoo and conditioner are just OK.</li>
            <li>The product is quality and the time for delivery was more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li>and I find the caviar alterna product is much more luxurious.</li>
            <li>I love Alterna products.</li>
            <li>I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>My hair color does not fade and the fragrance is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter introduced me to these products and we both love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this additionally to the travel set</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Any weather, blow dry and style or no, I get consistently awesome hair.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free - works fabulous!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner both smell great and make you hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean and healthy, and looks beautiful since I started using it last summer.</li>
            <li>I just use my hubbies shampoo and its fine again.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and rinses clean, but did not make my hair soft at all.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is good on the color, as in it doesn&#x27;t fade your color, but I have dry hair and it tends to make my hair more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; than I care for.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I like this product but wasn&#x27;t in love with it (which you really should for $20 a bottle!).</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>Only kind of shampoo I use now.  </li>
            <li>But you get what you pay for and this product is beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair bright red (the unnatural, actual red), and this does a good job of not washing it out.</li>
            <li>I like this produce very much.  </li>
            <li>This is Not the real stuff!</li>
            <li>I only needed a dime size of this product when purchased through a reputable dealer.</li>
            <li>Only buy through reputable salon suppliers.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still a woman who has a smidgen of vanity, and soft silky hair like the commercials is important to me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel any more special than typical shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; price and delivery was earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent at all.</li>
            <li>Lasts and lasts and lasts - fresh color, soft hair</li>
            <li>This is important as I suffer from fibromyalgia, which causes chronic pain, so often I don&#x27;t have the energy to do anything extra.</li>
            <li>okay not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started supplementing it with those deep conditioners about once a week, though, and my hair is back to its soft, nice self.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Altrena products for a few years and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Seems ok after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I do like this product because it makes my hair REALLY soft!  </li>
            <li>I will use a leave in conditioner afterwords since the sulfate free shampoo and conditioner leaves hair less silky.</li>
            <li>I guess because it makes it too soft maybe?  </li>
            <li>My red in my hair is staying brighter longer thanks to this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It protects the color but makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so its nice to have a product that makes it soft and thin.</li>
            <li>previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li>It requires putting in another stay-in conditioner to calm it down.</li>
            <li>My color is lasting longer and my hair feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>And it keeps my color looking like new (especially blond highlights which were last done in August).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or you will get weighted down hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it does much for blondes but for those that like to keep a dark and/or vibrant mane, it does the trick plus some!!</li>

            <li> Keeps color in longer than any other shampoo/ conditioner on the market.</li>

            <li> one complaint I might have is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to work extremely well, as my hair feels dry and a bit unhealthy after a while.</li>
            <li> I have color - treated hair with reds in it which is hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have thin, limp hair.</li>

            <li> Only kind of shampoo I use now.  Sulfate free - works fabulous!  My hairdresser is even noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Altrena products for a few years and I love them.  The shampoo and conditioner both smell great and make you hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Totally&lt;br /&gt;Changed my hair texture and quality. I have thin, limp hair. This created volume and a healthy feel. So worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  My color is lasting longer and my hair feels so soft and manageable. Get this!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent at all. Also, the shampoo and conditioner are just OK. I probably won&#x27;t finish using this; I&#x27;ll probably just throw out the rest and buy something different. I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Hair feels clean and healthy, and looks beautiful since I started using it last summer.</li>
            <li> This is Not the real stuff! I only needed a dime size of this product when purchased through a reputable dealer. Trying to save money I ruined my hair and learned a lesson. Only buy through reputable salon suppliers.</li>
