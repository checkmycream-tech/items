            <li>The pipettes are well made and the lids and bulbs are soft and work well.</li>
            <li>I got these are replacement droppers for the 1 and 2 ounce bottles I had ordered because I had read all the reviews and many talked about broken droppers in bottles.</li>

            <li> perfect for essential oils and for any other small measuring!</li>
            <li> These are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I use these for measuring out natural oils for Hair, cooking etc.  The quality of these can use some improvement.  The glass part slips away from the bulb every time I use these.  This is annoying because it takes more time to measure simple things.  These will more than likely end up in the trash &amp; I&#x27;ll buy another brand</li>
            <li> didnt fit into any of my now food essential oil bottles :( so sad</li>
            <li> Quality is better then I hoped for</li>
            <li> Great quality...only thing that took my by surprise is that they are child proof.  Not really desirable, but, not a show stopper.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the right length for the 1 oz Boston round bottles, but, here they are. The pipettes are well made and the lids and bulbs are soft and work well.</li>
            <li> I use these to mix and measure essential oil blends for lotions, roller bottles, my diffuser.</li>
            <li> not much to say other than it is as described and works good</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit all 1 Oz bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars because these do not seal the greatest but I only purchased them to get the contents out of the bottles,I put my original caps back on</li>
            <li> These droppers were just what I needed for 1 oz amber bottles I had on hand.  The droppers are good quality and they shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for my bottles.</li>
            <li> I received this very quick and they are perfect for what I need.</li>

The only negative thing (which is so irrelevant to me it didn&#x27;t even cost it a star) is that the tops didn&#x27;t fit right so they dont screw on to my essential oil bottles.</li>
            <li> These droppers actually fit my amber glass colored oil bottles well. Worth the money for a 12 pack!</li>
            <li> All arrived in tact, but am waiting for other oils and supplies before I try to blend my own.</li>

            <li> Perfect for what I needed them for</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and strong.  Just wish they were a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought these for essential oils, and when I finally got around to using them I found they are too long and will not close onto the bottles! Oh, well, they are still nice to have.  I have to look for some shorter ones. My fault for not looking at specs to begin with.</li>
            <li> These are great glass droppers, but when you order the 1 oz. bottles to go with them, make sure you order the ones with the wider neck or larger cap size. Don&#x27;t do like I did and end up with droppers that won&#x27;t screw on the bottles because the cap size is too large.</li>
            <li> did not work for me, I have the wrong bottles and really did not think it would be a problem, the bottles look to be a standard size.  Make sure your bottle size matches.</li>
            <li> I got these are replacement droppers for the 1 and 2 ounce bottles I had ordered because I had read all the reviews and many talked about broken droppers in bottles. Well, I didn&#x27;t have any broken droppers in the bottles I ordered, but I&#x27;m keeping these anyway, just in case I break one!. No problems and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent- fast delivery and very carefully packaged-, many thanks R maryland</li>
            <li> I use a lot of essential oils, and some of them don&#x27;t come with droppers. These work very well for my needs, although they don&#x27;t fit the really small 1/2-oz bottles. I had to find smaller droppers for those (cap size 18/400).</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Except for the screw top, these were just exactly what I needed.  I work with essential oils, and each oil needs its own dropper.  It is recommended not to leave the dropper attached to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was more than fair, and now I don&#x27;t have to wash and sanitize the one dropper I had.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how long glass tube was exactly but it was perfect for the bottles I have. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and the droppers are new and in good condition. I use these droppers for aromatherapy. I can clean and reuse the 1 ounce glass bottles but I need to replace the droppers because they cannot be cleaned, which has created the challenge of finding only the dropper. The price is very reasonable. I am looking forward to reordering.</li>
            <li> They are great. I left them in my essential oils bottles and thrashed the original lids.</li>
