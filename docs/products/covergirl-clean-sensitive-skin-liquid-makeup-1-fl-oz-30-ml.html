            <li>Also This stuff goes on great with my concealer brush.</li>
            <li>It was great to begin with but it seems like it&#x27;s clogging my pores after about a month of using it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it works great!</li>
            <li>And BTW, I&#x27;m not wrinkled, very fair, and a grandmother, so....don&#x27;t need to be 20 or 30 to use this great, light coverage!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a Very good product for a cheap price!</li>

            <li>Kind of disappears on me.</li>

            <li>( I have a fair complexion ) and this is the one and only foundation that matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>the color matches my extremely fair complexion, but will probably be too light for most people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Cover Girl Clean Make-up as my foundation.  </li>
            <li>Very light to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This foundation seemed to work better with makeup sponges instead of a makeup brush,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides on my face, it does not fill like it clogs up my pours.</li>
            <li>If you love it, leave your feedback at Cover girl and drugstore</li>
            <li>so they will continue to make this for us that love it.</li>
            <li>Do you know how many brands I&#x27;ve tried over the decades?</li>
            <li>TOO many, I stumbled on this choice at Target, now they don&#x27;t carry it</li>
            <li>I was using Pur-Minerals before and that stuff was okay.</li>
            <li>really good great price goes on smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Im 60 with great skin, just sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on smooth and easy and stays put for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to perfume, this has been my favorite foundation for years, and was originally recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Blends easily and stays on well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27; was fine</li>
            <li>This one goes on well with a make up sponge but use a light hand.</li>
            <li>Cheap makeup with no results.</li>
            <li>Fantastic foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>It is light and clean.</li>
            <li>Super clean, no breakouts, most of my pimples completely went away, healthy for your skin. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy that I&#x27;m able to go days without makeup and am anxious to see how my skin keeps improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit</li>
            <li>But I was given a full refund, no hassle.</li>
            <li>I also love that it blends well with my skin since I have a really hard time matching my very fair skin tone to foundations, as most of them are too yellow or too dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love cover girl sensitive brand</li>
            <li>The price is right and you can find it at any drugstore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is better suited to someone with near-flawless skin who wants to wear foundation, or the very young (under twenty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li>It provides great coverage for my blemishes yet is sheer enough that my freckles show through</li>
            <li>I wanted a foundation that was light and felt soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Foundations are tricky with me as most leave my face red after using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the first time I using that stuff</li>
            <li>That is really all I can say!</li>
            <li>Such a shame, as I love the color, coverage, and feel of this make-up, but</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do this at first</li>
            <li>also love the \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; option of the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; CoverGirl products, because I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Same good stuff as when I was a teen!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone who wants heavy coverage though- but to be fair</li>
            <li>Easily applied and absorbed, can be a bit flaky if the skin is dry.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve concealed certain areas I use my fingers for the rest.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too much of a pain to have to fight with the bottle every morning to get the foundation out.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll buy up as much as I can from eBay and Amazon.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using this my skin has really cleared up.</li>
            <li>Very matte.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is definitely added to the chemical mix, and once product was applied, it seems more like a sheer wash than a real foundation.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the less acne I experience.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new bottle about a month or so ago.  </li>
            <li>Covers what it needs to/should, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I have VERY sensitive skin), no smells.</li>
            <li>Appeared to be relabeled or perhaps very old merchandise.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant about trying this stuff as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and when I uses just a small amount of this foundation it made my face even more oily.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other foundations ( Revlon, Loreal, MAC, Rimmel etc ) in the past to find the perfect color to match my skin tone</li>
            <li>The color I got however was a little pinked tone for my slightly more yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and since practically everything else makes me break out</li>
            <li>Today was the first day in a long time I went without makeup, and I use to do it often before Neutrogena changed something in their foundation formula.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really soft and not harsh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews about how it&#x27;s difficult to get out of the bottle, I really didn&#x27;t have many issues.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin color, it came in a quick manner and it wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the same pressed powder compact ( Covergirl, Ivory ) to dust it lightly over my foundation.</li>

            <li> It matches my skin color, it came in a quick manner and it wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the same pressed powder compact ( Covergirl, Ivory ) to dust it lightly over my foundation.</li>
            <li> but it became clear I would need to do so in order to disguise redness, wrinkles, or other skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my foundation to be too thick, but of course it can&#x27;t be too thin or it wouldn&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li> Plan to keep buying this for as long as they continue making it.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected...</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving it a two is because it still matches my skin tone unlike other makeups that don&#x27;t have pinkish tones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, this won&#x27;t be it unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the scent.</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles were as pictured &amp; as sold in stores; two had silver lids and dark green labeling unlike this CG Sensitive Skin liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s partially what makes you break out.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> When I applied the foundation it&#x27;s only covered very few spots although it hid my redness, other then that I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like that the liquid is a bit thick and not super thin and runny, yet goes on relatively sheer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it waste of money</li>
            <li> so I dont look like a pale ghost.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too thick to actually come out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been told to stay away from &#x27;cheap&#x27; brands but after being sick of the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried I took a risk.</li>
            <li> This tends to be wasteful and it is hard to get the desired amount.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s so hard to find any foundation under $10 or doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it</li>
            <li> Broke my clear skin out so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says wet for longer than id like leaving a weird residue on my skin making it look like i haven&#x27;t blended it to my skin.</li>
            <li> This makeup is very thick and I needed to use a q-tip to get any out.  </li>
            <li> Ivory is too pink in the base for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Its VERY thick and takes some work to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> The packaging also was difficult to tackle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not meet my standards or my needs.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be leaving this weird residue.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible for it to get it out of the bottle without a q-tip or sponge.</li>
            <li> but it seems like it&#x27;s already &#x27;going bad&#x27;</li>
            <li> of disappointed in this product and won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> atop this base</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> because I use it in my eye area and the makeup with sunscreen irritates eyes terribly.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll have to go through the horrible process of trying to find something else.</li>
            <li> if that makes sense and it leaves this nasty looking residue on my face.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Very light to apply. Not sticky or greasy. No cake face.</li>
            <li> I wanted a foundation that was light and felt soft on my skin. This product preforms wonderfully. It did not make me breakout either! The color I got however was a little pinked tone for my slightly more yellow undertones. The packaging also was difficult to tackle. It is almost impossible for it to get it out of the bottle without a q-tip or sponge. This tends to be wasteful and it is hard to get the desired amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to my neutragena. I was kind of hesitant when it said creamy i should&#x27;ve kept being hesitant.&lt;br /&gt;It says wet for longer than id like leaving a weird residue on my skin making it look like i haven&#x27;t blended it to my skin. Its VERY thick and takes some work to get it out of the bottle! I&#x27;ve also been breaking out since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of disappointed in this product and won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> Hello, I bought this product in ivory but when I got it, it was all scratched up and so I check it and it&#x27; was fine but I just didn&#x27;t like the looks of it, it looked like it had sat in a shelf. When I applied the foundation it&#x27;s only covered very few spots although it hid my redness, other then that I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It&#x27;s very smooth and lasts all day. However, when I went to reorder it, the package got lost. But I was given a full refund, no hassle. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Foundations are tricky with me as most leave my face red after using. This one goes on well with a make up sponge but use a light hand.</li>
            <li> Uhh! I&#x27;d give this foundation zero stars if I could. Broke my clear skin out so bad. Threw it away after 2 uses. Waste of money! Horrible product! Will never purchase again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it waste of money&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can get my money back&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the first time I using that stuff</li>
            <li> I always use this brand and this color ( Ivory ) of foundation. I love how it goes on smooth and easy and stays put for hours and hours. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear off. I don&#x27;t have to blot it, because of oil. If I am sweating because of the heat, it still stays put. I have tried a few other foundations ( Revlon, Loreal, MAC, Rimmel etc ) in the past to find the perfect color to match my skin tone ( I have a fair complexion ) and this is the one and only foundation that matches my skin tone perfectly. I usually buy the same pressed powder compact ( Covergirl, Ivory ) to dust it lightly over my foundation. The best part about this foundation is it doesn&#x27;t cost ( between $ 4.00 - $ 6.00 ) a lot to get a quality foundation. Absolutely the best foundation. I received it in the mail quickly and in perfect condition. Great experience.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and when I uses just a small amount of this foundation it made my face even more oily. It looked like my face was covered in paint. Cheap makeup with no results.</li>
            <li> very pleased ...would consider ordering again.</li>
            <li> This makeup is very thick and I needed to use a q-tip to get any out.  Other than that, it provided a good amount of coverage and evened out my skin tone.  This foundation seemed to work better with makeup sponges instead of a makeup brush,</li>
            <li> Fantastic foundation. That is really all I can say! Covers what it needs to/should, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I have VERY sensitive skin), no smells. Love it. Plan to keep buying this for as long as they continue making it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before, but was leary to order on line. The color was perfect and the price was competitive.</li>
            <li> the color matches my extremely fair complexion, but will probably be too light for most people. Easily applied and absorbed, can be a bit flaky if the skin is dry. Best to use immediately after moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered four of this CG makeup. Two of the bottles were as pictured &amp; as sold in stores; two had silver lids and dark green labeling unlike this CG Sensitive Skin liquid makeup.  Appeared to be relabeled or perhaps very old merchandise.  Returned these two with Amazons good return policy.</li>
            <li> I really like that the liquid is a bit thick and not super thin and runny, yet goes on relatively sheer. It provides great coverage for my blemishes yet is sheer enough that my freckles show through so I dont look like a pale ghost. It blends in well to along my neck and hairline. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my foundation to be too thick, but of course it can&#x27;t be too thin or it wouldn&#x27;t be effective. I think this foundation is the perfect medium. I also love that it blends well with my skin since I have a really hard time matching my very fair skin tone to foundations, as most of them are too yellow or too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; option of the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; CoverGirl products, because I do have sensitive skin and I never get breakouts from using this.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappears on me. If you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, this won&#x27;t be it unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides on my face, it does not fill like it clogs up my pours. It is light and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a decade. It&#x27;s the best for my rosacea and dermatitis. The more I use it the less acne I experience. (another reviewer said the same thing) It&#x27;s lightweight and washes off with water. The price is right and you can find it at any drugstore. I hope they never discontinue this! If you love it, leave your feedback at Cover girl and drugstore so they will continue to make this for us that love it.</li>
            <li> Same good stuff as when I was a teen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Cover Girl Clean Make-up as my foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I just purchased a new bottle about a month or so ago.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too thick to actually come out of the bottle.  Such a shame, as I love the color, coverage, and feel of this make-up, but it&#x27;s too much of a pain to have to fight with the bottle every morning to get the foundation out.  I will be looking for something else.</li>
            <li> only make up I like....has no sunsceen  in it which I luv because I use it in my eye area and the makeup with sunscreen irritates eyes terribly.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it works great!</li>
            <li> Super clean, no breakouts, most of my pimples completely went away, healthy for your skin. :)</li>
            <li> After my two go-to companies discontinued my foundation from their lines, I opted for CoverGirl&#x27;s foundation based on their product information. Unfortunately, this product does not meet my standards or my needs. Ivory is too pink in the base for my skin tone. Fragrance is definitely added to the chemical mix, and once product was applied, it seems more like a sheer wash than a real foundation. I did not want to use further products (blush, powder, etc.) atop this base but it became clear I would need to do so in order to disguise redness, wrinkles, or other skin \\&quot;flaws\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better suited to someone with near-flawless skin who wants to wear foundation, or the very young (under twenty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and since practically everything else makes me break out this is the only foundation I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s lightweight- doesn&#x27;t cake- and doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all. Also, it&#x27;s so hard to find any foundation under $10 or doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it (also makes me break out). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone who wants heavy coverage though- but to be fair that&#x27;s partially what makes you break out. Wonderful product and wonderful price.&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/21/15 They have stopped making this and I&#x27;m really upset. Now I&#x27;ll have to go through the horrible process of trying to find something else. Guess I&#x27;ll buy up as much as I can from eBay and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected... It&#x27;s hypoallergenic... And it&#x27;s a Very good product for a cheap price! I love covergirl!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to EVERYTHING! Im 60 with great skin, just sensitive. Do you know how many brands I&#x27;ve tried over the decades? TOO many, I stumbled on this choice at Target, now they don&#x27;t carry it, I guess Amazon will be my friend when ordering. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found, thank goodness! And BTW, I&#x27;m not wrinkled, very fair, and a grandmother, so....don&#x27;t need to be 20 or 30 to use this great, light coverage!</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than going to the store. It&#x27;s just makeup. I was just getting a back up for when i ran out.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about trying this stuff as I have very sensitive skin. I was using Pur-Minerals before and that stuff was okay. It broke me out some and it would not stay. I&#x27;ve always been told to stay away from &#x27;cheap&#x27; brands but after being sick of the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried I took a risk. Thankfully it paid off. I&#x27;ve read reviews about how it&#x27;s difficult to get out of the bottle, I really didn&#x27;t have many issues. Also This stuff goes on great with my concealer brush. After I&#x27;ve concealed certain areas I use my fingers for the rest. It goes on smooth. Only down side is the scent. I don&#x27;t care for it. After about a week of using this my skin has really cleared up. Today was the first day in a long time I went without makeup, and I use to do it often before Neutrogena changed something in their foundation formula. I&#x27;m quite happy that I&#x27;m able to go days without makeup and am anxious to see how my skin keeps improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit&lt;br /&gt;I went from loving this product to hating it. It was great to begin with but it seems like it&#x27;s clogging my pores after about a month of using it. I wash my face well but I&#x27;m breaking out. It also seems to be leaving this weird residue. It didn&#x27;t do this at first but it seems like it&#x27;s already &#x27;going bad&#x27; if that makes sense and it leaves this nasty looking residue on my face. Seems like I&#x27;m going to have to search for another product again. So it went from five to two starts. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it a two is because it still matches my skin tone unlike other makeups that don&#x27;t have pinkish tones.</li>
            <li> Light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to perfume, this has been my favorite foundation for years, and was originally recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> really good great price goes on smooth and soft doesn&#x27;t clump up and it&#x27;s really soft and not harsh I love cover girl sensitive brand it&#x27;s the best and you can&#x27;t beat the price good stuff!</li>
            <li> It matches my skin color, it came in a quick manner and it wasn&#x27;t super expensive. I did save  a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Very matte. I have very fair skin and this is the only brand I can find which matches my skin tone. Blends easily and stays on well throughout the day.</li>
