            <li>&lt;br /&gt;carefully and successfully extract them without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li>My hubby was so impressed that HE wants to use this wonderful mask on his face!</li>
            <li>This is easily the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews .</li>
            <li>I decided to give the mask seven days to prove itself to me, and I&#x27;m VERY VERY glad</li>
            <li>Love this mask!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using this more!</li>
            <li>I use this twice a week, and wonder if I should use it more often!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the way I could feel it</li>
            <li>Dont think its effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled if the mask provides additional benefits like smoother, clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Origins instructions are to use this once a week or as often as needed, by opening your pores with warm, moist towel and layering the mask on.  </li>
            <li>used this with warm compresses and also with steaming, and neither method made a difference in the end result.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that</li>
            <li>This is a great mask and it leaves your skin looking recharged and clean, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>This product is nice, not a miracle mask, but ok.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best mask I have used.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s opinion: an adequate product but nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li>I wash and clean my skin and then apply the mask, leaving it on for 15 to 25 minutes and then use a washcloth with warm water to remove it (since the mask can take a while to wash off on its own).</li>
            <li>My favorite mask.</li>
            <li>I love the application and the removing process.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like kiehl&#x27;s amazon clay better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in skin clarity, but it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have shared this with my friends who also love it.</li>
            <li>maybe I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite masks.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask from Origins.</li>
            <li>This is not a moisturizing mask but is not drying and does an excellent job of deep cleaning your pores .Just</li>
            <li>Was buying some more of the spot treatment at an Origins store and bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li>My pores were no longer filled with gunk!</li>
            <li>but it is okay.</li>
            <li>The longer I&#x27;ve been using the mask better</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better after just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Origins having used it for almost 15 years.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY, MANY products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>My complexion was actually fantastic afterwards, NO redness!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Been purchasing for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>many others, the reviews on this Origins product lured me in.</li>
            <li>Turns out this product is not a sob-with-happiness miracle that will magically erase every blemish in one fell swoop.</li>
            <li>More sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>Now a couple of days later her skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I ordered a group of samples of Origins products and I&#x27;m glad this mask was included.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s a product that works better with continued use rather than a one shot deal.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite masks.  </li>
            <li>It is excellent in cleaning pores and giving your face an overall glow.</li>
            <li>Certainly, walking around with this mask on makes for great photographic opportunities for our fun-loving spouses, but my face has never felt as clean, nor looked so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would try out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean for hours after using it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really that impressive.</li>
            <li>great mask for clear skin</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and hopeful with my results so far.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, it does not peel off - but a warm water hot towel takes it rite off.</li>
            <li>Since getting off Proactiv I decided that I wanted to try a new face mask, and after reading the good reviews on Sephora and Origins.com</li>
            <li>I actually use a face wash that contains charcoal, and I&#x27;m aware that charcoal is really effective at getting rid of oil and clearing out pores, so when I read the great reviews about this mask I knew I had to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good- Unlike other reviewers, I thought this product went on easily, and came off nicely.  </li>
            <li>Its important to keep it out of your eyebrows because it will clump them up.</li>
            <li>Make sure you open your pores with a hot cloth first to get the best results.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely fantastic beauty product.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>On site after site I found THOUSANDS of consumers consistently ranking it with four or five stars, with several happy customers even going as far as to say they wept with joy when they looked into the mirror after just one use.</li>
            <li>After I used this mask the first time I saw a ton of blackheads that can risen to the surface and was able to</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love some of the ingredients, but I am able to use it without my sensitive skin reacting.</li>
            <li>My expectation was that blackheads would magically disappear and, with any luck, large pores might shrink.</li>
            <li>Even though I love trying new products, nothing else comes close to keeping my Tzone clean and smooth and non-oily like this Origins Charcoal Mask.  </li>
            <li>really want to love this product, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I still wear the full mask about once a week.  </li>
            <li>It feels kinda cool when it drys to.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>but overall it was good.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t as good, product is expired, and just doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li>I leave it on until it dries completely (about 15 minutes; if I can leave it longer then I do) and then rinse with warm water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the more reasonably priced clay masks on the market, and it delivers results quickly.</li>
            <li>The mask arrived very quickly and exactly as decribed and promised.</li>
            <li>I have acne and super clogged pores that would make be breakout.  </li>
            <li>I havent seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear for the most part!</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean after I use it and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, amazingly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I LOVE ORIGINS CLEAR IMPROVEMENT!</li>
            <li>I use it along with alcohol free witch hazel and pure jojoba oil, and you would never know that I struggle with acne.</li>
            <li>I was unwilling to believe so many others who bought and loved it were just lying, so I looked a bit further into the reviews and saw many users reported an initial breakout while the activated charcoal first begins to draw the most deeply imbedded impurities from the skin.</li>
            <li>This mask is really amazing at clearing out pores and making your skin look younger and clearer.</li>
            <li>mask really leaves my skin feeling and looking smooth and decongested.</li>
            <li>I had no expectations for this product, but tried it out for fun on a whim.</li>
            <li>Pores are clear after use, skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if it actually brought impurities beneath the skin to the surface or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks, but this is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li>I cannot find anything to keep these large pores clean, and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>This stuff did everything all the positive reviews said!</li>
            <li>This time, after the mask, I noticed a very large blackhead on my cheek that wasn&#x27;t there before the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and make a clear difference the size of your pore.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about this mask is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (compared to Ahava and Biore, etc).</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in a more practical dispenser like a jar/tub...</li>
            <li>I use it as directed and steam my face first...</li>
            <li>That said, the color is exactly what I would expect from a Charcoal Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I pressed on and haven&#x27;t had any more clogged pores, but weeks later, I&#x27;m still battling that first clogged pore.  </li>
            <li>it draws a lot out of your pores, give whiteheads at first</li>
            <li>Wearing the mask helped with this because I wasn&#x27;t interested in picking at it</li>
            <li>Feeling pretty for him instead.</li>
            <li>I steam my face with a hot damp towel for five minutes before applying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the tingling, I&#x27;ve had no ill side effects like redness, burning or itching.</li>
            <li>(successfully) treated the initial breakout with Neutrogena&#x27;s topical 2.5% benzoyl peroxidecream.</li>
            <li>(I cannot emphasize enough how important this step is), applied the mask, waited 45 minutes, and voila!</li>
            <li>Many of the blackheads on my nose and cheeks had entirely vanished!</li>
            <li>Really feel soft and smooth day after.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the positive effects are just in my head.</li>
            <li>lovely product which I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>The Origins mask definitely broke me out more at first, but after using it several times, my skin is much clearer and smoother - and the blackheads on my nose are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>…after I used the mask once, I found a rather large clogged pore on my cheek.  </li>
            <li>On the first try I didn&#x27;t think I noticed a huge difference in my pores looking cleaner or smaller, but my skin was definitely much softer after using the mask.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and kind of a mess to use</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great little tool.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this stuff really controls it.  </li>
            <li>Really helped me</li>
            <li>Also, the product works very well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and pleasing to use.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t comment on the removal of toxins, but</li>
            <li>But here’s what really happened</li>
            <li>; I did not like nearly as much .This</li>
            <li>It makes me feel cleaner, but it seems to get tried too fast.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this product really helps to reduce pores appearance.</li>
            <li>I really think this mask has changed my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with pimples for almost my whole life - and this keeps them under control.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out from using this mask.</li>
            <li>Within 48 hours, all traces of the breakout had vanished and I was ready to try the mask again.</li>
            <li>Its really gentle as well and does not exasperate my rosacea.</li>
            <li>my skin is a clear as a babies bum!!!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers stated, make sure to steam treat your face before applying this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use-------put it on, let it dry, take it off and you are done.</li>
            <li>Its kind of a small tube, I did not observe the size</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth after, albeit a tad dry.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to wipe off the mask with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li>My pores are clearer, less congested, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>I am 33 y/o and of Indian(from India) decent.  </li>
            <li>Decent price too.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price, and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I have used many face masks .The much more expensive glamour mud ( I hope I have the name correct )  </li>
            <li>so the super gunk and oil absorbent charcoal can do its job optimally and give you a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li>I kept it on overnight because my skin gets problematic during the warmer months, particularly blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>Got rid of most of my blackheads after the first few applications!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and very oily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people with oil skin type.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I know it certainly didn&#x27;t clear my pores.</li>
            <li>put a little dab on a pimple at night and by the morning it&#x27;s mostly gone</li>
            <li>It would probably work even better if I steam a little longer and leave the mask on for 20.  </li>
            <li>It was awesome getting to face my husband when he came home and not feeling ugly.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and normal on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>and it was easier to resist the normal habit.  </li>
            <li>Most masks are just too harsh to use that frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using it as a traditional mask is incredibly refreshing, and I also add a dot here and there as overnight spot treatment to dry out growing pimples.</li>
            <li>The downside of this product is that it can dry your skin, so make sure to properly moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, so I usually buy french green clay from mountain rose herbs and make my own masks.</li>
            <li>applied the mask after steaming for about 15 min and allowed it to dry for a full hour.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin, with very enlarged, clogged pores covering nearly every inch of my face.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for windy weather and overall cold climate.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tingly feeling if you use for the first time, but the next uses it will feel cmfortable.</li>
            <li>so I could prep my skin for first use with a steam facial - YOU MUST STEAM YOUR FACE BEFORE YOU USE THIS</li>
            <li>The first time she used it we could tell a definite difference in the size of her pores.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur masks seem to do a better job, by drying out active breakouts instead of making them larger.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems with acne and wants to improve the overall appearance of their skin.</li>
            <li>My pores are tight and my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had large, clogged pores since I was a teen and had come to accept</li>
            <li>Origins Clear Improvement(TM)</li>
            <li>To Clear Pores</li>
            <li>I used to use salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products to clear up acne, but now I just use this mask once a week.</li>
            <li>When I returned home from early voting last week and saw the package from Amazon on my doorstep, I bolted as fast as I could from my car to the kitchen</li>
            <li>This face mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>It dries up very oily skin such as myself.  </li>
            <li>ok have to use at least every 3 days in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>This mask really surprised me.</li>
            <li>in my early thirties and my skin has been giving me lots of problems: oily, congested pores, and never-ending breakouts.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s yielded very noticeable results over a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I experienced an immediate onset of disappointment as soon as I washed it off, as my face looked red and dry and a fresh crop of pimples was forming on my chin.</li>
            <li>At night I like to use this mask as a mask, but also as a spot treatment to dry out really stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>this period of adjusting to the product is absolutely worth the trouble as the benefits are clear and significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realize that the clogged pores and new blackheads may not have been due to the mask, but I didn&#x27;t have these rather large problems prior to using the mask.</li>
            <li>It certainly did not \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; every trace of gunk from every pore, but it did immediately clear several very stubbord blackheads around my nose and cheeks, and despite a little over-drying, my skin looked cleaner than it has in years!</li>
            <li>remember to press hot moist towel on your face a few times briefly before application to really get those pores open</li>
            <li>I felt hideous when I saw myself in the mirror and hated going out because I had to wear so much makeup that it didn&#x27;t look good and even didn&#x27;t cover up the acne very well.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that while this mask is definitely drying at first, it&#x27;sno where near as bad as most masks are and probably won&#x27;t be a problem for you if you don&#x27;t already have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I felt the tight tingling feeling the first time and ever since.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleaned my pores out, in fact I had a couple new pimples the next day because it drew out the clogged pores like after a facial.</li>
            <li>To be clear: this treatment is not a one-stop shop - you still need to use some sort of facial cleanser beforehand, and follow the same rules as you would without it</li>
            <li>Sucks the impurities right out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every treatment imaginable and had very little success.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft and squeaky clean, and even a little bit tight (which I like).</li>
            <li>Apparently it had a bigger effect than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED if you don&#x27;t see a dramatic change or even if your skin looks worse after the first try - be prepared to treat the possibility of an initial breakout and have your favorite moisturizer ready, and then give it a week or two to let the mask show you what it can do.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this causes no tightness, redness or dry patches.</li>
            <li>you have been battling large, clogged pores for years and have acne-prone skin that won&#x27;t cooperate with harsh exfoliants, TRY THIS MASK!&lt;br</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;carefully and successfully extract them without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li> My hubby was so impressed that HE wants to use this wonderful mask on his face!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews .</li>
            <li> I decided to give the mask seven days to prove itself to me, and I&#x27;m VERY VERY glad</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this more!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week, and wonder if I should use it more often!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the way I could feel it</li>
            <li> Dont think its effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled if the mask provides additional benefits like smoother, clearer skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Origins instructions are to use this once a week or as often as needed, by opening your pores with warm, moist towel and layering the mask on.  </li>
            <li> used this with warm compresses and also with steaming, and neither method made a difference in the end result.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that</li>
            <li> This is a great mask and it leaves your skin looking recharged and clean, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, not a miracle mask, but ok.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have used.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s opinion: an adequate product but nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> I wash and clean my skin and then apply the mask, leaving it on for 15 to 25 minutes and then use a washcloth with warm water to remove it (since the mask can take a while to wash off on its own).</li>
            <li> My favorite mask.</li>
            <li> I love the application and the removing process.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like kiehl&#x27;s amazon clay better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in skin clarity, but it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have shared this with my friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> maybe I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite masks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask from Origins.</li>
            <li> This is not a moisturizing mask but is not drying and does an excellent job of deep cleaning your pores .Just</li>
            <li> Was buying some more of the spot treatment at an Origins store and bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li> My pores were no longer filled with gunk!</li>
            <li> but it is okay.</li>
            <li> The longer I&#x27;ve been using the mask better</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better after just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Origins having used it for almost 15 years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY, MANY products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> My complexion was actually fantastic afterwards, NO redness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Been purchasing for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> many others, the reviews on this Origins product lured me in.</li>
            <li> Turns out this product is not a sob-with-happiness miracle that will magically erase every blemish in one fell swoop.</li>
            <li> More sophisticated.  </li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> Now a couple of days later her skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I ordered a group of samples of Origins products and I&#x27;m glad this mask was included.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s a product that works better with continued use rather than a one shot deal.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite masks.  </li>
            <li> It is excellent in cleaning pores and giving your face an overall glow.</li>
            <li> Certainly, walking around with this mask on makes for great photographic opportunities for our fun-loving spouses, but my face has never felt as clean, nor looked so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would try out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean for hours after using it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really that impressive.</li>
            <li> great mask for clear skin</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am happy and hopeful with my results so far.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , it does not peel off - but a warm water hot towel takes it rite off.</li>
            <li> Since getting off Proactiv I decided that I wanted to try a new face mask, and after reading the good reviews on Sephora and Origins.com</li>
            <li> I actually use a face wash that contains charcoal, and I&#x27;m aware that charcoal is really effective at getting rid of oil and clearing out pores, so when I read the great reviews about this mask I knew I had to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good- Unlike other reviewers, I thought this product went on easily, and came off nicely.  </li>
            <li> Its important to keep it out of your eyebrows because it will clump them up.</li>
            <li> Make sure you open your pores with a hot cloth first to get the best results.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic beauty product.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> On site after site I found THOUSANDS of consumers consistently ranking it with four or five stars, with several happy customers even going as far as to say they wept with joy when they looked into the mirror after just one use.</li>
            <li> After I used this mask the first time I saw a ton of blackheads that can risen to the surface and was able to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love some of the ingredients, but I am able to use it without my sensitive skin reacting.</li>
            <li> My expectation was that blackheads would magically disappear and, with any luck, large pores might shrink.</li>
            <li> Even though I love trying new products, nothing else comes close to keeping my Tzone clean and smooth and non-oily like this Origins Charcoal Mask.  </li>
            <li> really want to love this product, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I still wear the full mask about once a week.  </li>
            <li> It feels kinda cool when it drys to.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> but overall it was good.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t as good, product is expired, and just doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> I leave it on until it dries completely (about 15 minutes; if I can leave it longer then I do) and then rinse with warm water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the more reasonably priced clay masks on the market, and it delivers results quickly.</li>
            <li> The mask arrived very quickly and exactly as decribed and promised.</li>
            <li> I have acne and super clogged pores that would make be breakout.  </li>
            <li> I havent seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty clear for the most part!</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean after I use it and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, amazingly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I LOVE ORIGINS CLEAR IMPROVEMENT!</li>
            <li> I use it along with alcohol free witch hazel and pure jojoba oil, and you would never know that I struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> I was unwilling to believe so many others who bought and loved it were just lying, so I looked a bit further into the reviews and saw many users reported an initial breakout while the activated charcoal first begins to draw the most deeply imbedded impurities from the skin.</li>
            <li> This mask is really amazing at clearing out pores and making your skin look younger and clearer.</li>
            <li> mask really leaves my skin feeling and looking smooth and decongested.</li>
            <li> I had no expectations for this product, but tried it out for fun on a whim.</li>
            <li> Pores are clear after use, skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t know if it actually brought impurities beneath the skin to the surface or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks, but this is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li> I cannot find anything to keep these large pores clean, and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> This stuff did everything all the positive reviews said!</li>
            <li> This time, after the mask, I noticed a very large blackhead on my cheek that wasn&#x27;t there before the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and make a clear difference the size of your pore.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this mask is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (compared to Ahava and Biore, etc).</li>
            <li> I only wish it came in a more practical dispenser like a jar/tub...</li>
            <li> I use it as directed and steam my face first...</li>
            <li> That said, the color is exactly what I would expect from a Charcoal Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pressed on and haven&#x27;t had any more clogged pores, but weeks later, I&#x27;m still battling that first clogged pore.  </li>
            <li> it draws a lot out of your pores, give whiteheads at first</li>
            <li> Wearing the mask helped with this because I wasn&#x27;t interested in picking at it</li>
            <li> Feeling pretty for him instead.</li>
            <li> I steam my face with a hot damp towel for five minutes before applying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the tingling, I&#x27;ve had no ill side effects like redness, burning or itching.</li>
            <li> (successfully) treated the initial breakout with Neutrogena&#x27;s topical 2.5% benzoyl peroxidecream.</li>
            <li> (I cannot emphasize enough how important this step is), applied the mask, waited 45 minutes, and voila!</li>
            <li> Many of the blackheads on my nose and cheeks had entirely vanished!</li>
            <li> Really feel soft and smooth day after.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the positive effects are just in my head.</li>
            <li> lovely product which I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> The Origins mask definitely broke me out more at first, but after using it several times, my skin is much clearer and smoother - and the blackheads on my nose are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> …after I used the mask once, I found a rather large clogged pore on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> On the first try I didn&#x27;t think I noticed a huge difference in my pores looking cleaner or smaller, but my skin was definitely much softer after using the mask.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky and kind of a mess to use</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a great little tool.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this stuff really controls it.  </li>
            <li> Really helped me</li>
            <li> Also, the product works very well.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and pleasing to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t comment on the removal of toxins, but</li>
            <li> But here’s what really happened</li>
            <li> ; I did not like nearly as much .This</li>
            <li> It makes me feel cleaner, but it seems to get tried too fast.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product really helps to reduce pores appearance.</li>
            <li> I really think this mask has changed my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with pimples for almost my whole life - and this keeps them under control.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out from using this mask.</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours, all traces of the breakout had vanished and I was ready to try the mask again.</li>
            <li> Its really gentle as well and does not exasperate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> my skin is a clear as a babies bum!!!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers stated, make sure to steam treat your face before applying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use-------put it on, let it dry, take it off and you are done.</li>
            <li> Its kind of a small tube, I did not observe the size</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth after, albeit a tad dry.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to wipe off the mask with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> My pores are clearer, less congested, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> I am 33 y/o and of Indian(from India) decent.  </li>
            <li> Decent price too.  </li>
            <li> Decent for the price, and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used many face masks .The much more expensive glamour mud ( I hope I have the name correct )  </li>
            <li> so the super gunk and oil absorbent charcoal can do its job optimally and give you a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li> I kept it on overnight because my skin gets problematic during the warmer months, particularly blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Got rid of most of my blackheads after the first few applications!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and very oily.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people with oil skin type.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I know it certainly didn&#x27;t clear my pores.</li>
            <li> put a little dab on a pimple at night and by the morning it&#x27;s mostly gone</li>
            <li> It would probably work even better if I steam a little longer and leave the mask on for 20.  </li>
            <li> It was awesome getting to face my husband when he came home and not feeling ugly.  </li>
            <li> have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and normal on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> and it was easier to resist the normal habit.  </li>
            <li> Most masks are just too harsh to use that frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using it as a traditional mask is incredibly refreshing, and I also add a dot here and there as overnight spot treatment to dry out growing pimples.</li>
            <li> The downside of this product is that it can dry your skin, so make sure to properly moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so I usually buy french green clay from mountain rose herbs and make my own masks.</li>
            <li> applied the mask after steaming for about 15 min and allowed it to dry for a full hour.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin, with very enlarged, clogged pores covering nearly every inch of my face.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for windy weather and overall cold climate.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tingly feeling if you use for the first time, but the next uses it will feel cmfortable.</li>
            <li> so I could prep my skin for first use with a steam facial - YOU MUST STEAM YOUR FACE BEFORE YOU USE THIS</li>
            <li> The first time she used it we could tell a definite difference in the size of her pores.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur masks seem to do a better job, by drying out active breakouts instead of making them larger.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems with acne and wants to improve the overall appearance of their skin.</li>
            <li> My pores are tight and my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had large, clogged pores since I was a teen and had come to accept</li>
            <li> Origins Clear Improvement(TM)</li>
            <li> To Clear Pores</li>
            <li> I used to use salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products to clear up acne, but now I just use this mask once a week.</li>
            <li> When I returned home from early voting last week and saw the package from Amazon on my doorstep, I bolted as fast as I could from my car to the kitchen</li>
            <li> This face mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> It dries up very oily skin such as myself.  </li>
            <li> ok have to use at least every 3 days in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> This mask really surprised me.</li>
            <li> in my early thirties and my skin has been giving me lots of problems: oily, congested pores, and never-ending breakouts.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s yielded very noticeable results over a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I experienced an immediate onset of disappointment as soon as I washed it off, as my face looked red and dry and a fresh crop of pimples was forming on my chin.</li>
            <li> At night I like to use this mask as a mask, but also as a spot treatment to dry out really stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> this period of adjusting to the product is absolutely worth the trouble as the benefits are clear and significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realize that the clogged pores and new blackheads may not have been due to the mask, but I didn&#x27;t have these rather large problems prior to using the mask.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; every trace of gunk from every pore, but it did immediately clear several very stubbord blackheads around my nose and cheeks, and despite a little over-drying, my skin looked cleaner than it has in years!</li>
            <li> remember to press hot moist towel on your face a few times briefly before application to really get those pores open</li>
            <li> I felt hideous when I saw myself in the mirror and hated going out because I had to wear so much makeup that it didn&#x27;t look good and even didn&#x27;t cover up the acne very well.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that while this mask is definitely drying at first, it&#x27;sno where near as bad as most masks are and probably won&#x27;t be a problem for you if you don&#x27;t already have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I felt the tight tingling feeling the first time and ever since.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleaned my pores out, in fact I had a couple new pimples the next day because it drew out the clogged pores like after a facial.</li>
            <li> To be clear: this treatment is not a one-stop shop - you still need to use some sort of facial cleanser beforehand, and follow the same rules as you would without it</li>
            <li> Sucks the impurities right out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every treatment imaginable and had very little success.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft and squeaky clean, and even a little bit tight (which I like).</li>
            <li> Apparently it had a bigger effect than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED if you don&#x27;t see a dramatic change or even if your skin looks worse after the first try - be prepared to treat the possibility of an initial breakout and have your favorite moisturizer ready, and then give it a week or two to let the mask show you what it can do.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this causes no tightness, redness or dry patches.</li>
            <li> you have been battling large, clogged pores for years and have acne-prone skin that won&#x27;t cooperate with harsh exfoliants, TRY THIS MASK!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had serious trouble with touching my face and pinching it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve begun using the mask every other night for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use every other day if not everyday.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after every each mask, but I guess this alone wont treat my white heads and black heads totally.</li>
            <li> Much less than a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and after three uses, my pores are cleaner, smaller, and less visible than they&#x27;ve been since I was</li>
            <li> they would just stay that way, excepting the few hours that followed vigorous facial cleansing routines or a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> I waited another full day (to offset how much it&#x27;s dried my skin) before trying a third round, and I almost couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!</li>
            <li> The majority of my pores weren&#x27;t simply swept clear - the mask drew out blockages to the point that little sebum plugs were poking out all over my face, and I achieved manual extraction of these without inflicting trauma or damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have a dry, red, irritated face once I washed it off.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t have any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Now after a few days my skin is looking better and less dull.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for the size of container, but it works better than any other mask I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds from the very expensive Perricone cold plasma to the really cheap natural clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I agree with another reviewer that I don&#x27;t necessarily like the dispensation system (see how big of a mess you make in a white bathroom while trying to squeeze a tube with your hands covered in a mud mask), if it came in a jar or tub</li>
            <li> If I do get minor breakouts I also use the mask as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I tend to put it on all over and then go back and fill in any empty spots.</li>
            <li> I got this mask the other day and have used it three times (twice in one day and once last night)</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Once you get it on though, it starts to tingle and then dry and tighten almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or irritate it in any way.</li>
            <li> I started using a few activated charcoal products around the same time, after extensive research.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have, in the last few years, started dealing with some large pores.  </li>
            <li> I did not dry my skin or leave it feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> Further, it ruptured the breakouts it caused, which led to dark marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After the first use of this mask my face was worse than it was before I used it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was shocked at how much brighter and clearer my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to save up for expensive facials after using this mask several times and getting consistent results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually considered “gross” by my kids, which results in 15 minutes of quiet time for mommy.  </li>
            <li> This is what I did, although instead of rinsing the mask, I wiped it away with a wet washcloth after allowing it to dry for 15 minutes--at which point my face has been shrink-wrapped by the product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and my pores seem less visible (not smaller, but cleaner).</li>
            <li> A few days later I found myself staring at the mirror thinking my pores looked a little gross and that I should probably use the mask again.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, doesn&#x27;t really make any difference for my face, doesn&#x27;t really remove my blackheads which on my nose, but i like the texture, the price is not that bad too</li>
            <li> I spent.  </li>
            <li> I have not really noticed blackheads coming out, but my skin does look a lot smoother, healthier</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, and have no real issues to speak of.</li>
            <li> This may not have been due to the mask, but it was something I&#x27;d never experienced before, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up—yet  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with longterm use my skin will visibly improve (less obvious pores, fewer blackheads, softer skin, possibly slightly less acne), but even if my skin just continues to feel softer I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I did get a few small bumps on my chin, which am hoping will clear out soon.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> I use the mask every other day before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> As with other clay masks, it takes a lot of rinsing to get all of the mask off.  </li>
            <li> I usually just put enough on to have an even layer.</li>
            <li> I tried proactive among other things.  </li>
            <li> Lifts impurities and dirt from face, without having to use all these other toxic materials or alcohol.</li>
            <li> but I believe consistent use of this product will yield the results all the hundreds of other masks and cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have been unable to provide.</li>
            <li> Not as drying as other charcoal masks.  </li>
            <li> Active Charcoal Mask</li>
            <li> This is quite an average &amp;#34;active charcoal&amp;#34; mask.</li>
            <li> My skin oils are thick, white and gooey.  </li>
            <li> This mask was included in an Origins bundle with a few other products - I never would have bought it otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black heads.</li>
            <li> and I have less break-outs.</li>
            <li> As time went by I had to use less and less of it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really tight</li>
            <li> I am oily and extremely acne prone, with cystic acne around my chin and small bumps all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I find it a little drying</li>
            <li> I use a little every day, and I know that this will be a product I will use from now on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get them cleared away without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Origins Clear Improvement is not the mask for me</li>
            <li> I also felt it helpful to apply a thin layer of tea tree oil to my face once I was done to &#x27;close&#x27; my pores back up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In terms of application, the mask goes on unevenly, and once you put it on your face</li>
            <li> (it takes a few minutes to get off but can be removed with just water and your hands), tone, and then moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put it on, let it dry/ harden for a few minutes, then wash off.</li>
            <li> I do have blackeads around my nose, chin, forhead, and cheek bones, but when I removed the mask from my face, every black head was gone!</li>
            <li> but it absolutely ruined my skin!! :(</li>
            <li> The bad was that it caused a number of new breakouts but didn&#x27;t do anything for the couple of active breakouts I had before the mask.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really bad acne, just some blackheads, so I can only vouch for its effectiveness on blackheads and the occasional t-zone</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for the price, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> By the 4th I was no better off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that I only had a sample!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 and combination skin for the past five years, and I&#x27;ve tried using face masks before, both a clay mask from the Body Shop and Proactiv&#x27;s mask that contains sulphur.</li>
            <li> However, I agree with other reviewers that this product is less expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> the black color is somewhat unappealing.  </li>
            <li> It looks weird, but I wash it off in the morning and my acne is much smaller and less angry looking.</li>
            <li> I sucks out the excess oil and guck.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I read made it sounds like the fountain of youth, so try to keep your expectations reasonable and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My nose, cheeks, and forehead were still inundated with blackheads, and all in all my skin looked a lot worse than it had before trying the mask.</li>
            <li> This mask made a dramatic difference after just one use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this mask, as I usually adore Origins products.</li>
            <li> eh for as expensive as this is</li>
            <li> But I am giving it 3 stars because it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect miracle cure - nothing is -</li>
            <li> The mask is a very unappetizing color, not that I&#x27;m eating the mask, but in the fluffy, frilly world of cosmetics</li>
            <li> bad-</li>
            <li> If I feel a bad breakout coming on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also shocked at how often I can use the mask and it still doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I hit puberty I have suffered from horrible acne.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite mask. I have probably repurchased this mask 5 times. I have sensitive skin and this causes no tightness, redness or dry patches. Absolutely love it, leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, amazingly soft and moisturized. I love the application and the removing process. You can give your face a mini massage while removing the product since it turns into a lotion like consistency. Its important to keep it out of your eyebrows because it will clump them up. Other than that... lovely product which I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This mask was included in an Origins bundle with a few other products - I never would have bought it otherwise.  I had no expectations for this product, but tried it out for fun on a whim. I&#x27;ve had large, clogged pores since I was a teen and had come to accept they would just stay that way, excepting the few hours that followed vigorous facial cleansing routines or a professional facial.  I no longer feel the need to save up for expensive facials after using this mask several times and getting consistent results.  Pores are clear after use, skin tone more even. That&#x27;s all there is to it.  I didn&#x27;t prep my face beforehand either with steaming or exfoliating. I will definitely be purchasing this product as a regular part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have been using it for about a month and a half.  I started on May 22, 2013.  I have acne and super clogged pores that would make be breakout.  I don&#x27;t have black heads. I am 33 y/o and of Indian(from India) decent.  I have oily skin and this stuff really controls it.  I also use the Clinique 3 Step Acne system.  I use the mask every other day before I go to bed.  Use the mask as it says to do so.  I did not dry my skin or leave it feeling tight.  I would use the Clinique system in the morning and night and then on the next day I would use the Clinique system in the morning then at night I would use the Origins Mask.  Really helped me and I hope this review helps someone as well.</li>
            <li> The good- Unlike other reviewers, I thought this product went on easily, and came off nicely.  As with other clay masks, it takes a lot of rinsing to get all of the mask off.  I liked the way I could feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad- This product brought to the surface a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t actually remove it.  After I finished rinsing the mask, I found myself &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; with my fingers to remove the \\&quot;stuff.\\&quot;  My acne did not improve with use of this mask, though it did make my skin look cleaner, overall. I also felt it helpful to apply a thin layer of tea tree oil to my face once I was done to &#x27;close&#x27; my pores back up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again because it doesn&#x27;t really do enough for the $ I spent.  This product may do well as part of a &#x27;routine&#x27; but definitely not as a stand-alone item (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> Works great. I sucks out the excess oil and guck. I cut back for the winter but about twice a week in the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  It wasn&#x27;t an immediate change, but after about a couple of weeks of using 3 x a week, ALL my blackheads are GONE!  I&#x27;ve been dealing with blackhead since puberty hit, and I&#x27;m 30 now.  Amazing product.  Decent price too.  Much less than a professional facial.  I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Dont think its effective. and you cant get every product out at the end. I like kiehl&#x27;s amazon clay better</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this mask, as I usually adore Origins products. This is quite an average &amp;#34;active charcoal&amp;#34; mask. Decent for the price, and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Its kind of a small tube, I did not observe the size lol. Bought it for my BF he says he uses it!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time</li>
            <li> This face mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in skin clarity, but it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Using it as a traditional mask is incredibly refreshing, and I also add a dot here and there as overnight spot treatment to dry out growing pimples. It makes your skin feel soft and squeaky clean, and even a little bit tight (which I like). To be clear: this treatment is not a one-stop shop - you still need to use some sort of facial cleanser beforehand, and follow the same rules as you would without it (don&#x27;t touch your face, pick scabs etc) but overall it&#x27;s a great little tool. The bottle has lasted me six months of nightly spot treatments and weekly full-facials.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after every each mask, but I guess this alone wont treat my white heads and black heads totally. There&#x27;s a tingly feeling if you use for the first time, but the next uses it will feel cmfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this. I was introduced by a friend who swore she used it at 16 and ever since and she&#x27;s in her 30s. I felt the tight tingling feeling the first time and ever since. Your face will truly feel the diffrrence. However, I agree with other reviewers that this product is less expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s and have combination skin.  I have used this product for maybe 10 years now.  A little goes a long way.  I use it 2-3x a week on just my Tzone.  Even though I love trying new products, nothing else comes close to keeping my Tzone clean and smooth and non-oily like this Origins Charcoal Mask.  I only wish it came in a more practical dispenser like a jar/tub...I feel like a lot of it gets left in the tube.</li>
            <li> eh for as expensive as this is it&#x27;s not really that impressive. My face felt great after using it and it cleared up some of my acne though. it is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> The mask arrived very quickly and exactly as decribed and promised. Also, the product works very well. It is gentle on the skin and pleasing to use. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Works!&lt;br /&gt;I put a little dab on a pimple at night and by the morning it&#x27;s mostly gone</li>
            <li> This stuff works! Make sure you open your pores with a hot cloth first to get the best results. I have used it as a spot treatment overnight and it did not make the zit disappear but it also did not get bigger which for me is an improvement.</li>
            <li> This mask is really amazing at clearing out pores and making your skin look younger and clearer. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will buy it again when this container is finished. It is a bit expensive for the size of container, but it works better than any other mask I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is easy to use and make a clear difference the size of your pore. Leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and you have clearer smaller pores.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask and it leaves your skin looking recharged and clean, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. Some of the reviews I read made it sounds like the fountain of youth, so try to keep your expectations reasonable and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin! No redness and helps get rid of acne. I have shared this with my friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this mask. My face feels really clean after I use it and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads. I use it as directed and steam my face first...maybe I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. I have tried many different kinds from the very expensive Perricone cold plasma to the really cheap natural clay. This charcoal mask outperforms them all. It is very sticky and kind of a mess to use so I deducted one star. Still a very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years. One of the best.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite masks. Really feel soft and smooth day after.</li>
            <li> I try to set aside some time once a week for a facial mask.  It&#x27;s usually considered “gross” by my kids, which results in 15 minutes of quiet time for mommy.  I&#x27;m thrilled if the mask provides additional benefits like smoother, clearer skin.  Unfortunately, Origins Clear Improvement is not the mask for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and normal on my cheeks.  The mask is a very unappetizing color, not that I&#x27;m eating the mask, but in the fluffy, frilly world of cosmetics the black color is somewhat unappealing.  That said, the color is exactly what I would expect from a Charcoal Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origins instructions are to use this once a week or as often as needed, by opening your pores with warm, moist towel and layering the mask on.  This is what I did, although instead of rinsing the mask, I wiped it away with a wet washcloth after allowing it to dry for 15 minutes--at which point my face has been shrink-wrapped by the product.  My skin feels really tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t comment on the removal of toxins, but the deep dwelling pore-cloggers? Let me address that  My expectation was that blackheads would magically disappear and, with any luck, large pores might shrink. Note, these are my words, not Origins&#x27;, and this was just part of my interpretation of the benefits of the mask  But here’s what really happened…after I used the mask once, I found a rather large clogged pore on my cheek.  This may not have been due to the mask, but it was something I&#x27;d never experienced before, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up—yet  The next week, I gave my face an up close and thorough examination before and after using the mask.  This time, after the mask, I noticed a very large blackhead on my cheek that wasn&#x27;t there before the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, any sane person would have said, “this just isn&#x27;t the mask for me”.  But I&#x27;m not sane. I pressed on and haven&#x27;t had any more clogged pores, but weeks later, I&#x27;m still battling that first clogged pore.  I do believe that some of the “deep-dwelling pore-cloggers” are being drawn to the surface, but in my case they aren&#x27;t being “drawn out”.  The mask has done nothing for the blackheads around my nose  My pores don&#x27;t look any smaller  I do like smoother feel to my skin after the mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to love this product, but I can&#x27;t.  I realize that the clogged pores and new blackheads may not have been due to the mask, but I didn&#x27;t have these rather large problems prior to using the mask. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this mask is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (compared to Ahava and Biore, etc). The bad was that it caused a number of new breakouts but didn&#x27;t do anything for the couple of active breakouts I had before the mask. Further, it ruptured the breakouts it caused, which led to dark marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if it actually brought impurities beneath the skin to the surface or it simply caused me to break out. I know it certainly didn&#x27;t clear my pores. I didn&#x27;t turn red or end up with hives or burns or anything, so I suppose that&#x27;s the upside. Otherwise, for the price, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. Sulfur masks seem to do a better job, by drying out active breakouts instead of making them larger. After the first use of this mask my face was worse than it was before I used it. By the 4th I was no better off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with warm compresses and also with steaming, and neither method made a difference in the end result. While there is no research out there to support charcoal&#x27;s ability to draw impurities from the pores, I took a chance on this product based on the rave reviews. In the end, I had to go back to my sulfur mask to undo what this had done to my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask from Origins. I instantly notice a difference in my skin when I use this. Sucks the impurities right out!</li>
            <li> I have used many face masks .The much more expensive glamour mud ( I hope I have the name correct )  ; I did not like nearly as much .This mask really leaves my skin feeling and looking smooth and decongested.This is not a moisturizing mask but is not drying and does an excellent job of deep cleaning your pores .Just remember to press hot moist towel on your face a few times briefly before application to really get those pores open so the super gunk and oil absorbent charcoal can do its job optimally and give you a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li> This stuff did everything all the positive reviews said! I kept it on overnight because my skin gets problematic during the warmer months, particularly blackheads on my nose. The Origins mask definitely broke me out more at first, but after using it several times, my skin is much clearer and smoother - and the blackheads on my nose are significantly diminished. My forehead, which is often a problem area, is flawless!! Wish I&#x27;d taken a before/after photo! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel cleaner, but it seems to get tried too fast. Highly recommended for people with oil skin type.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. But I am giving it 3 stars because it is too expensive. It is 24 dollars if you go to macy&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Was buying some more of the spot treatment at an Origins store and bought this on a whim. I use it once a week and so far I&#x27;m liking it. I usually just put enough on to have an even layer. Skin feels smooth after, albeit a tad dry. It&#x27;ll probably take some tinkering to get it just right. Got rid of most of my blackheads after the first few applications! Looking forward to using this more!</li>
            <li> Holy hell! My skin is pretty clear for the most part! I do have blackeads around my nose, chin, forhead, and cheek bones, but when I removed the mask from my face, every black head was gone! My pores were no longer filled with gunk! I must buy this ASAP! I&#x27;m sad that I only had a sample! My hubby was so impressed that HE wants to use this wonderful mask on his face! I&#x27;ve never seen my blackheads just vanish like they did. Omg. Praise The Lord my skin is a clear as a babies bum!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great. You can feel it working and clearing the gunk from your skin. I did get a few small bumps on my chin, which am hoping will clear out soon. My skin felt great as soon as I washed the mask and it was easy to wipe off the mask with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This masque is my favourite band!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic beauty product. Your skin feels so smoothe after using it. The downside of this product is that it can dry your skin, so make sure to properly moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> great mask for clear skin</li>
            <li> Origins Clear Improvement(TM) Active Charcoal Mask To Clear Pores 3.4 oz is one product that does what it says, REDUCE PORE size.  I have used this for six months with cystic acne, and it reduces redness and helps keep them away.  It dries up very oily skin such as myself.  If you have acne or oily skin please try this.  It smells great, it does not peel off - but a warm water hot towel takes it rite off.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this type of mask before, but the reviews convinced me.  Certainly, walking around with this mask on makes for great photographic opportunities for our fun-loving spouses, but my face has never felt as clean, nor looked so healthy.  I use this twice a week, and wonder if I should use it more often!  I am a fan!</li>
            <li> ok have to use at least every 3 days in the beginning.  it draws a lot out of your pores, give whiteheads at first</li>
            <li> Very good mask. I have not really noticed blackheads coming out, but my skin does look a lot smoother, healthier and I have less break-outs. After I use this mask my skin looks like I just received a facial. I will definitely purchase this again..</li>
            <li> Since I hit puberty I have suffered from horrible acne.  Blackheads, whiteheads, deep acne, surface acne, you name it.  My skin oils are thick, white and gooey.  It&#x27;s hard to get them cleared away without irritating my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried every treatment imaginable and had very little success.  I tried proactive among other things.  Proactive just cost a lot of money and my acne didn&#x27;t go away because the chemicals in the treatment products just irritated my skin and encouraged infection and inflammation.  I felt hideous when I saw myself in the mirror and hated going out because I had to wear so much makeup that it didn&#x27;t look good and even didn&#x27;t cover up the acne very well.&lt;br /&gt;Then my husband found this product and ordered it for me as a pre-deployment gift.  I used it for six months while he was gone.  Every night I put it on and I took it off in the morning.  (they recommend 15 minutes a day but I went over board..)  I didn&#x27;t steam my face before applying it but I probably should have, but usually I applied it after taking a hot shower.  I&#x27;ve always been a acne picker.  Had serious trouble with touching my face and pinching it.  Wearing the mask helped with this because I wasn&#x27;t interested in picking at it and it was easier to resist the normal habit.  During the day I applied a scar lightening cream and some acne fighting make up.  As time went by I had to use less and less of it.  Now I only have to spot treat at night with the charcoal mask and wear a dab of makeup here and there for a the occasional zit from my period.  This stuff is AWESOME!  It gave me my life back.  I feel beautiful again.  My pores are tight and my skin is smooth.  I still wear the full mask about once a week.  I need to apply it to my back where I still struggle with some acne.  I haven&#x27;t ever applied it there before.  It was awesome getting to face my husband when he came home and not feeling ugly.  Feeling pretty for him instead.</li>
            <li> God has answered my prays! not only does this shrink pores but it gets rid of acne too. This has to be the greatest product Origins has created. BEYOND LOVIN&#x27; IT.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be clay based but it is okay. I havent seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, not a miracle mask, but ok.  I don&#x27;t love some of the ingredients, but I am able to use it without my sensitive skin reacting.</li>
            <li> This mask really surprised me. I actually use a face wash that contains charcoal, and I&#x27;m aware that charcoal is really effective at getting rid of oil and clearing out pores, so when I read the great reviews about this mask I knew I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early thirties and my skin has been giving me lots of problems: oily, congested pores, and never-ending breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different masks, but this is by far the most effective. The first time I used it I was shocked at how much brighter and clearer my skin looked. Also, my skin felt incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve begun using the mask every other night for nearly 3 weeks. I wash and clean my skin and then apply the mask, leaving it on for 15 to 25 minutes and then use a washcloth with warm water to remove it (since the mask can take a while to wash off on its own). The longer I&#x27;ve been using the mask better my skin looks. My pores are clearer, less congested, and my skin tone is more even. If I do get minor breakouts I also use the mask as a spot treatment. I&#x27;m also shocked at how often I can use the mask and it still doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin. Most masks are just too harsh to use that frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems with acne and wants to improve the overall appearance of their skin.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Cheaper than stores!  My skin looks and feels better after just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have used. It keeps the skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated. Great product all around.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My face feels clean for hours after using it! I use every other day if not everyday. I know it says once a week, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. It feels kinda cool when it drys to. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! I have oily skin and this product really helps to reduce pores appearance. My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product. You feel it cleaning out your pores.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this but it absolutely ruined my skin!! :(</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really think this mask has changed my skin. I am oily and extremely acne prone, with cystic acne around my chin and small bumps all over my forehead. I started using a few activated charcoal products around the same time, after extensive research. This mask is amazing. Changed the texture of my skin. I use it along with alcohol free witch hazel and pure jojoba oil, and you would never know that I struggle with acne. I leave it on for about 1 hour, three times a week. I steam my face with a hot damp towel for five minutes before applying.  You might have some &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; of the deeper stuff that&#x27;s stuck in your skin, but stick with it!! (Unless you&#x27;re getting what you think is an allergic or sensitivity reaction, seems like some people might have some sensitivities to this product. That doesn&#x27;t surprise me. It is definitely exfoliating)</li>
            <li> I got this mask the other day and have used it three times (twice in one day and once last night) and I can honestly say that&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and hopeful with my results so far. I have tried EVERYTHING (including antibiotics) to try to get rid of my blackheads and whiteheads (and scarring and pimples)&lt;br /&gt;but nothing has worked. After I used this mask the first time I saw a ton of blackheads that can risen to the surface and was able to&lt;br /&gt;carefully and successfully extract them without leaving a mark. It was amazing. After using it last night, I notice a difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I continue to see results on this and will keep updating. But for now, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  It exfoliates beautifully. It leaves my skin moist and smooth. I use it weekly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, doesn&#x27;t really make any difference for my face, doesn&#x27;t really remove my blackheads which on my nose, but i like the texture, the price is not that bad too</li>
            <li> Did what it said, stung a bit but overall it was good. I find it a little drying so I use it once a week only.</li>
            <li> I love Origins having used it for almost 15 years. Here&#x27;s the word.... DO NOT BUY ONLINE. The quality isn&#x27;t as good, product is expired, and just doesn&#x27;t work the same. Go to Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s opinion: it stings, and it does not perform to expectations.  My daughter&#x27;s opinion: an adequate product but nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. I&#x27;ve struggled with pimples for almost my whole life - and this keeps them under control. I use it twice a week, and have no real issues to speak of.</li>
            <li> Works great my skin looks so refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great mask. But you can buy it a sephora online or in store for 22 dollars same size</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin. This seems to be for those on the oily side.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY, MANY products in my lifetime. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have, in the last few years, started dealing with some large pores.  I cannot find anything to keep these large pores clean, and this product does the trick. I read rave review after rave review, and so I bought the product.  I use a little every day, and I know that this will be a product I will use from now on.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so I usually buy french green clay from mountain rose herbs and make my own masks. This one is great though. It tingles a bit while drying, so I thought I was going to have a dry, red, irritated face once I washed it off. My complexion was actually fantastic afterwards, NO redness! I don&#x27;t have really bad acne, just some blackheads, so I can only vouch for its effectiveness on blackheads and the occasional t-zone breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I went out without makeup after using it and received compliments on my complexion, so I don&#x27;t think the positive effects are just in my head. I used to use salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products to clear up acne, but now I just use this mask once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product. It&#x27;s one of the more reasonably priced clay masks on the market, and it delivers results quickly. I have oily skin and some blackheads, especially around my nose. This mask made a dramatic difference after just one use. As other reviewers stated, make sure to steam treat your face before applying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 and combination skin for the past five years, and I&#x27;ve tried using face masks before, both a clay mask from the Body Shop and Proactiv&#x27;s mask that contains sulphur. Both of these masks made me break out. Since getting off Proactiv I decided that I wanted to try a new face mask, and after reading the good reviews on Sephora and Origins.com I decided to give this mask a try. On the first try I didn&#x27;t think I noticed a huge difference in my pores looking cleaner or smaller, but my skin was definitely much softer after using the mask. A few days later I found myself staring at the mirror thinking my pores looked a little gross and that I should probably use the mask again. Apparently it had a bigger effect than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree with another reviewer that I don&#x27;t necessarily like the dispensation system (see how big of a mess you make in a white bathroom while trying to squeeze a tube with your hands covered in a mud mask), if it came in a jar or tub I&#x27;m sure it would try out very quickly. In terms of application, the mask goes on unevenly, and once you put it on your face it&#x27;s difficult to spread. This is the biggest downside of this product. I tend to put it on all over and then go back and fill in any empty spots. Once you get it on though, it starts to tingle and then dry and tighten almost immediately. I leave it on until it dries completely (about 15 minutes; if I can leave it longer then I do) and then rinse with warm water (it takes a few minutes to get off but can be removed with just water and your hands), tone, and then moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the tingling, I&#x27;ve had no ill side effects like redness, burning or itching. I have not broken out from using this mask. My skin is softer and my pores seem less visible (not smaller, but cleaner). I&#x27;m hoping that with longterm use my skin will visibly improve (less obvious pores, fewer blackheads, softer skin, possibly slightly less acne), but even if my skin just continues to feel softer I will keep using this product. If you&#x27;re on the fence I recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Put it on, let it dry/ harden for a few minutes, then wash off. Lifts impurities and dirt from face, without having to use all these other toxic materials or alcohol. Use this charcoal mask, once every 2 weeks. Been purchasing for many years. Always happy with results.</li>
            <li> Amazingggg. Love it. This has been a staple in my skincare routine for almost a year now. If I feel a bad breakout coming on I use it daily and it is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t have any negative side effects. My skin is very sensitive and very oily. This unclogs all the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used - in fact, it&#x27;s the ONLY mask I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s yielded very noticeable results over a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, the reviews on this Origins product lured me in. On site after site I found THOUSANDS of consumers consistently ranking it with four or five stars, with several happy customers even going as far as to say they wept with joy when they looked into the mirror after just one use. I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin, with very enlarged, clogged pores covering nearly every inch of my face. I have been searching for \\&quot;the miracle\\&quot; for years at this point, so my expectations for this were staggering after reading the reviews. When I returned home from early voting last week and saw the package from Amazon on my doorstep, I bolted as fast as I could from my car to the kitchen so I could prep my skin for first use with a steam facial - YOU MUST STEAM YOUR FACE BEFORE YOU USE THIS IF YOU WANT MAXIMUM RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the mask after steaming for about 15 min and allowed it to dry for a full hour. I experienced an immediate onset of disappointment as soon as I washed it off, as my face looked red and dry and a fresh crop of pimples was forming on my chin. My nose, cheeks, and forehead were still inundated with blackheads, and all in all my skin looked a lot worse than it had before trying the mask. Turns out this product is not a sob-with-happiness miracle that will magically erase every blemish in one fell swoop. I was unwilling to believe so many others who bought and loved it were just lying, so I looked a bit further into the reviews and saw many users reported an initial breakout while the activated charcoal first begins to draw the most deeply imbedded impurities from the skin. I decided to give the mask seven days to prove itself to me, and I&#x27;m VERY VERY glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (successfully) treated the initial breakout with Neutrogena&#x27;s topical 2.5% benzoyl peroxidecream. Within 48 hours, all traces of the breakout had vanished and I was ready to try the mask again. I steamed my face (I cannot emphasize enough how important this step is), applied the mask, waited 45 minutes, and voila! I saw results. It certainly did not \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; every trace of gunk from every pore, but it did immediately clear several very stubbord blackheads around my nose and cheeks, and despite a little over-drying, my skin looked cleaner than it has in years! I waited another full day (to offset how much it&#x27;s dried my skin) before trying a third round, and I almost couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! Many of the blackheads on my nose and cheeks had entirely vanished! The majority of my pores weren&#x27;t simply swept clear - the mask drew out blockages to the point that little sebum plugs were poking out all over my face, and I achieved manual extraction of these without inflicting trauma or damage to my skin. I&#x27;m 25 years old and after three uses, my pores are cleaner, smaller, and less visible than they&#x27;ve been since I was 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I LOVE ORIGINS CLEAR IMPROVEMENT! It&#x27;s not a perfect miracle cure - nothing is - but I believe consistent use of this product will yield the results all the hundreds of other masks and cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have been unable to provide. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED if you don&#x27;t see a dramatic change or even if your skin looks worse after the first try - be prepared to treat the possibility of an initial breakout and have your favorite moisturizer ready, and then give it a week or two to let the mask show you what it can do. I&#x27;m still getting a pimple or two with each use but this period of adjusting to the product is absolutely worth the trouble as the benefits are clear and significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been battling large, clogged pores for years and have acne-prone skin that won&#x27;t cooperate with harsh exfoliants, TRY THIS MASK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that while this mask is definitely drying at first, it&#x27;sno where near as bad as most masks are and probably won&#x27;t be a problem for you if you don&#x27;t already have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Not as drying as other charcoal masks.  More sophisticated.  Does the job well.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great mask that makes a noticeable difference after I use it. I have acne prone skin, which I battle with tea tree oil and salicylic acid during the day. At night I like to use this mask as a mask, but also as a spot treatment to dry out really stubborn acne. It looks weird, but I wash it off in the morning and my acne is much smaller and less angry looking.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin.  This product was recommended by the aesthetician who gave her a facial recently.  The first time she used it we could tell a definite difference in the size of her pores.  Now a couple of days later her skin looks great!</li>
            <li> The product and service was good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I find after using it that my blackheads are gone, my pores look much smaller, and my skin looks and feels softer, smoother, and refreshed. While I do not have acne-prone skin, I do have some blackheads on my nose and this works in removing them. Its really gentle as well and does not exasperate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews . It does refresh your face but then all face masks do . Didn&#x27;t help my acne .</li>
            <li> I ordered a group of samples of Origins products and I&#x27;m glad this mask was included. I steamed my face for about 8 minutes and left the mask on for about 15. It definitely cleaned my pores out, in fact I had a couple new pimples the next day because it drew out the clogged pores like after a facial. Now after a few days my skin is looking better and less dull. I will probably use this mask again in a day or two to continue clearing out my clogged pores over time. It seems like it&#x27;s a product that works better with continued use rather than a one shot deal. It would probably work even better if I steam a little longer and leave the mask on for 20.  It didn&#x27;t over-dry my combination skin or irritate the rosacea I sometimes get on my cheeks. Definitely try this mask if you want clearer pores without over-drying. I&#x27;ll definitely buy a larger size once the sample size runs out. I also use Plantscriptions Anti-Aging Serum as a moisturizer day and night as well as the Checks and Balances Frothy Face wash..this combo of Origins products goes great together as a way to combat acne and combination/sensitive skin. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite masks.  It is perfect for windy weather and overall cold climate.  It is excellent in cleaning pores and giving your face an overall glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for several years.  My skin is sensitive. This mask doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or irritate it in any way. I like the way it deep cleans my skin. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it at one time.  It&#x27;s easy to use-------put it on, let it dry, take it off and you are done.</li>
