    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and it is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Annemarie Borlind products before and think they&#x27;re one of the best skincare lines on the market.</li>
            <li>great product!!!</li>
            <li>great product!!!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I love all of their products!!</li>
            <li>Good product, received on time</li>
            <li>the price was amazing.</li>
            <li>I received my product fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Annemarie Borlind!</li>
            <li>love the results ....</li>
            <li>I do not have  the wrinkle many years.</li>
            <li>Love love love this eye cream and</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different eye creams from $200 to over the counter ones, but this one is by far the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is the greatest product, and the only one I  found not irritating to my eyelids.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected and was impressed with speediness of delivery</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re a clean product and have to pass Germany&#x27;s strict ingredients rules in order to be sold in the pharmacies of Germany.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good to stop the formation and further deepening of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but this stuff really works--way better than lancome, estee lauder, chanel, shisedo, and it is organic--not greasy, soaks right in so can use morning under makeup and night...</li>
            <li>I shop a lot online and fortunately have had virtually all good experiences in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products, and I always come back to Borlind.</li>
            <li>I have been using for many years until Whole Foods stopped carrying it saying it was too expensive--and finally found again on line.</li>
            <li>While I love Annemarie Borlind&#x27;s zz sensitive night cream, this particular product made the underneath of my eyes almost as red as a tomato.</li>
            <li>Regeneration is an awesome line - not too crazy expensive but very effective skin care.</li>
            <li>I clearly had an allergic reaction to this product, so if you have sensitive skin like I do, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this was neither a good product or seller experience for me.</li>
            <li>No strong fragrance, which is important for me.</li>
            <li>The LL Eye Wrinkle Cream is light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The LL line is for 30+ year skin types--skin that is showing the first few lines and creases of aging.</li>

            <li> I HAVE USED OTHER EYE CREAMS AND THEY BURNED MY SKIN ,MADE MY EYES TEAR UP OR SEEMED INEFFECTIVE. THIS HAS A SOOTHING FEELING UNDER TIRED EYES, MOISTURIZES AND HELPS THE PUFFINESS AND WRINKES.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Annemarie Borlind! Regeneration is an awesome line - not too crazy expensive but very effective skin care. I received my product fast and in perfect condition. Would  buy again from this seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and it is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Annemarie Borlind products before and think they&#x27;re one of the best skincare lines on the market. I&#x27;ve tried so many products, and I always come back to Borlind. I like that they&#x27;re a clean product and have to pass Germany&#x27;s strict ingredients rules in order to be sold in the pharmacies of Germany. The LL line is for 30+ year skin types--skin that is showing the first few lines and creases of aging. It&#x27;s a good to stop the formation and further deepening of lines and wrinkles. The LL Eye Wrinkle Cream is light and a little goes a long way. I always put it on immediately following toner and before my face cream. It never seems heavy and I the area around my eyes becomes less papery and the lines diminish. I also use a little bit on the frown creases between my eye brows.</li>
            <li> Great product. The seller shipped it immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive creams and I feel this works just as well. No strong fragrance, which is important for me.</li>
            <li> I know you have heard this before...but this stuff really works--way better than lancome, estee lauder, chanel, shisedo, and it is organic--not greasy, soaks right in so can use morning under makeup and night...just a small dab does the trick--wrinkles soften and eyes look refreshed and has never caused me any eye irritation. I have been using for many years until Whole Foods stopped carrying it saying it was too expensive--and finally found again on line.</li>
            <li> It is the greatest product, and the only one I  found not irritating to my eyelids. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected and was impressed with speediness of delivery</li>
            <li> I love all of their products!!</li>
            <li> Borlind&#x27;s US distributor shot itself in the foot by closing down for a time which led us to discover that we could buy the same products for less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> While I love Annemarie Borlind&#x27;s zz sensitive night cream, this particular product made the underneath of my eyes almost as red as a tomato. I clearly had an allergic reaction to this product, so if you have sensitive skin like I do, this may not be for you. To add insult to injury, I packaged my cream up, went to the post office and paid the shipping to return the item (noting reason and obtaining return authorization label through the amazon link). Well, I was notified now that the item cannot be returned, as it has been opened. I shop a lot online and fortunately have had virtually all good experiences in the past. Needless to say, this was neither a good product or seller experience for me. This is the first time that I have run across a seller that does not stand behind the product if you have a reaction to it. I am out of my time and $40, so that bad taste is still lingering.</li>
            <li> Too thin, absorbed immediately and felt as if there was nothing under my eyes after using this cream.  Also, has too heavy a scent.  Don&#x27;t think eye cream should have perfume in it.  Threw it out..</li>
            <li> Good product, received on time</li>
            <li> great product!!! love the results ....</li>
            <li> I do not have  the wrinkle many years.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eye cream and the price was amazing.I have tried many many different eye creams from $200 to over the counter ones, but this one is by far the best I have tried. I have extra dry skin around my eye and this has hydrated my eye area immensely.</li>
            <li> Luv this product using it for years!</li>
            <li> great product!!! Would recommend Borlind product line to anyone..</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and my face looks younger than my age. Would recommend Borlind product line to anyone..</li>
