    <ol>
            <li>OVER PRICED, but an excellent product for the temporary repair of dentures and partials (</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was just perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>still holding great product</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Thank you, great product for a temporary fix.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and worked perfectly .</li>
            <li>A Dremmel is a good tool for trimming and polishing.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried the others, not as good.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly, packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>The denture repair kit is the best substitute for a new pair of dentures.</li>
            <li>This product is far and away the best in it&#x27;s field.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash well after&lt;br /&gt;making</li>
            <li>And yet the GLASS vial holding the powdered adhesive was busted, most of the contents were lost.</li>
            <li>I like to make sure she always has a backup too.</li>
            <li>Most stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>Having to wait eight days for a quick temporary repair kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use but sets up very quickly</li>
            <li>This filled the hole and is still working after 3 months.  </li>
            <li>HARD TO FINE ,BEST REPAIR KIT</li>
            <li>Its way cheaper than going to the dental lab for a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship .</li>
            <li>A tooth fell out in the front and I was so embarrassed to smile.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE THE  PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>this did not work for me after 3 times of trying&amp;#34;  seems more than enough</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, and holds tight and strong.</li>
            <li>My wife has a plastic upper plate with about 7 or 8 teeth on it, and we&#x27;ve been able to repair most of the teeth, even when it started to get thin from use we were able to build up the surface again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford a new denture right now, my front tooth broke off and I used plate weld to fix it.</li>
            <li>Older family member needed an emergency fix!  </li>
            <li>so you must be ready with all the required steps before you start.</li>
            <li>See your dentist or lab and get a real repair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>partial, be sure to visit your dentist, and have a new one made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by the ease of use, but let me be clear my plate was not broken in half, it had a small crack and the weld is working out</li>
            <li>Can highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The material does dry quickly so have everything ready.</li>
            <li>the bond looked fantastic when extracted from the hot water immersion but failed immediately once the denture was put back into the mouth.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE AS I DEVELOPED MEDICAL CONDITIONS directly related to it requiring an emergency room visit.</li>
            <li>see no reason it won&#x27;t work for a larger crack but not to sure about a broken in half type repair,I suppose for a very short period it will last until you get a new plate</li>

            <li> This product is easy to use but sets up very quickly so you must be ready with all the required steps before you start. Once you are prepared it only takes a few minutes to complete the repair. The repair has worked well.</li>
            <li> OVER PRICED, but an excellent product for the temporary repair of dentures and partials (not metal).&lt;br /&gt;If you have a model from your dentist, the repaired appliance fits well with a small amount&lt;br /&gt;of trimming. A Dremmel is a good tool for trimming and polishing. Be sure to wash well after&lt;br /&gt;making the repair - use dish soap - not toothpaste. When you can no longer repair your denture&lt;br /&gt;or partial, be sure to visit your dentist, and have a new one made.</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous product that contains some of the worst chemicals to ones body . DO NOT USE AS I DEVELOPED MEDICAL CONDITIONS directly related to it requiring an emergency room visit.</li>
            <li> I had a hole In my denture.  This filled the hole and is still working after 3 months.  Great product</li>
            <li> A tooth fell out in the front and I was so embarrassed to smile.  I cant afford a dentist in todays economy and thought Id try this.  It worked and the tooth is STILL in after a month of pressure on it from biting into food and eating.  Im amazed.  I keep a couple in my med. cabinet now just incase I ever need it again.  EXCELLANT</li>
            <li> This worked though you have to be like a doctor doing a surgery.  Good product for the price. This saved me lot of money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford a new denture right now, my front tooth broke off and I used plate weld to fix it. The repair held for a year &amp;only broke because I used my teeth to open plastic package. Stupid. The material does dry quickly so have everything ready. I also used a metal fingernail file to file off excessive material then finished with the sandpaper that is included.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Plate-Weld\\&quot;....Is always needed in an emergency situation. Amazon got it to  us faster than anyone else possibly could!!  We could not find this product in  any retail store. Its easy to use, and holds tight and strong. Thank you, Amazon, for being there!</li>
            <li> The denture repair kit is the best substitute for a new pair of dentures. Better by far than \\&quot;Crazy Glue\\&quot;, or any other product on the market. My only disappointment is that Plate Weld is no longer available at my local pharmacy, as it once was. Having to wait eight days for a quick temporary repair kind of defeats the purpose. On the other hand, my dentist only guaranteed a four day turn around and it would cost several hundred dollars. I learned my lesson. I&#x27;ll keep a package on hand from now on!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother. Followed the instructions, the powder mixed into a blob with no adhesive value whatsoever. Wouldn&#x27;t stick to the denture, wouldn&#x27;t even stick to my finger. See your dentist or lab and get a real repair. Or don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t bother with Plate Weld or similar powder-based dental glues. I&#x27;m only giving it one star because the review won&#x27;t accept zero stars.</li>
            <li> Just what the &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; ordered. Worked perfectly. I have used this product several times and with satisfaction every time. Thanks</li>
            <li> Older family member needed an emergency fix!  This was just perfect.  Delivered quickly, packaged perfectly. It worked as promised and there is plenty left over just in case!  Just what we needed.</li>
            <li> My wife has a plastic upper plate with about 7 or 8 teeth on it, and we&#x27;ve been able to repair most of the teeth, even when it started to get thin from use we were able to build up the surface again.</li>
            <li> The box was tempered with and some items removed before shipping. I do not like it when items are missing for the box.</li>
            <li> Pretty worthless for mending a broken plate. I followed the instruction to the T and the bond looked fantastic when extracted from the hot water immersion but failed immediately once the denture was put back into the mouth.</li>
            <li> still holding great product</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged. And yet the GLASS vial holding the powdered adhesive was busted, most of the contents were lost. Also, the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; was extremely crude. As a result there may not have been enough powder to guarantee aproper balance  of powder to liquid matrix.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FINE ,BEST REPAIR KIT</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Has not dissapointed yet.</li>
            <li> Its way cheaper than going to the dental lab for a quick fix.  After I used this product to fix a tooth that came out of my denture&lt;br /&gt;I made an appt. with the dentist.  When I told him what I used to fix the tooth, he sent me home stating that this product was the same product that the dental lab uses &amp; he would have to rebreak the tooth/plate if I insisted they fix it. Great product.</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED THE PRODUCT BEFOE  BUT HAD TROUBLE FINDING  A STORE IN MY AREA. I LIKE THE  PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> Thank you, great product for a temporary fix. I bought this for someone trying to survive on disability income,&lt;br /&gt;who is unable to replace the broken one;it saved the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and worked perfectly . Quick ship . Can highly recommend. If I had to buy again I would not hesitate to use again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the ease of use, but let me be clear my plate was not broken in half, it had a small crack and the weld is working out fine.&lt;br /&gt;I see no reason it won&#x27;t work for a larger crack but not to sure about a broken in half type repair,I suppose for a very short period it will last until you get a new plate</li>
            <li> sorry this did not work for me after 3 times of trying and they want 8 more words and i have no idea why cause &amp;#34;sorry this did not work for me after 3 times of trying&amp;#34;  seems more than enough</li>
            <li> I needed to repair an upper denture that had cracked into two pieces.  It did not keep the dentures from cracking into two pieces within a few days after the repair.  Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My friend loves this stuff. She uses it to repair her dentures. I like to make sure she always has a backup too.</li>
            <li> This product is far and away the best in it&#x27;s field. I have tried the others, not as good. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find. Most stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. If you can find it, and need it, buy this one.</li>
