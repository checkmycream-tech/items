            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This line of hair products is popular in our house.</li>
            <li>but it is nice to have to keep hair from blowing around</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>favorite hair gel- sticky and dries nicely..</li>
            <li>This thing will hold for more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This power gel is my son&#x27;s favorite to spike his bangs.</li>
            <li>Better than any gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off as well as</li>
            <li>it holds great, but is more like a paste to apply and I don&#x27;t like that dry sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff for short hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to fear accidentally brushing against your hair and ruining the gel, this products will still hold true.</li>
            <li>But this stuff gives me control of my hair while giving it a more natural look to it, like it just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Cant fine local anymore.</li>
            <li>It works better than expected</li>
            <li>He loves this more than any other gel, since it has a stronger hold and not an offensive or girly scent.  </li>
            <li>My son uses this to keep the hair on the very top of his head styled up, back and little over to one side.  </li>
            <li>other products require shampoo this comes off easily with just water.</li>
            <li>a nice subtle scent-</li>
            <li>We use several Garnier Fructis products and feel they do exactly what they promise.</li>
            <li>You also get 2x more than the Fiber Gum for the same price, and I also use less.</li>
            <li>My old standby (Fructis Fiber Gum) was discontinued, so I tried this instead.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old son uses this daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly stiff and holds my very straight hair all day.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for people who have a active lifestyle but still want their hair done.</li>

            <li> No flakes, last into the next day with some little water vamp up.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too sticky like putting glue in your hair!</li>
            <li> My old standby (Fructis Fiber Gum) was discontinued, so I tried this instead. It&#x27;s incredibly stiff and holds my very straight hair all day. It dries to a very hard feel, but never flakes. Washes out very easily. You also get 2x more than the Fiber Gum for the same price, and I also use less. I&#x27;m gonna stock up, just in case.</li>
            <li> My son uses this to keep the hair on the very top of his head styled up, back and little over to one side.  He loves this more than any other gel, since it has a stronger hold and not an offensive or girly scent.  Too bad I can no longer find it locally.</li>
            <li> This thing will hold for more than 24 hours. Use it with a blow dryer and your hair will stay in position. Easy to wash off as well as other products require shampoo this comes off easily with just water.</li>
            <li> I use this to spike my hair in the front. I used to use Crew Fiber, but it was expensive and this holds much better.</li>
            <li> This line of hair products is popular in our house. We use several Garnier Fructis products and feel they do exactly what they promise. This power gel is my son&#x27;s favorite to spike his bangs. It holds all day and does not leave any white, flaky residue. Great price and so convenient to order through Amazon!</li>
            <li> it holds great, but is more like a paste to apply and I don&#x27;t like that dry sticky feeling. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in thick long hair unless you are using it for a Mohawk!</li>
            <li> No flakes, last into the next day with some little water vamp up.</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult to control. It likes to puff up like a baby chick&#x27;s hair. And when I use regular gel, I need to use a lot and it just looks like a turtle shell on my head. But this stuff gives me control of my hair while giving it a more natural look to it, like it just got out of the shower. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Cant fine local anymore.</li>
            <li> It works better than expected and I have to thin it out so not to be so firm holding but it is nice to have to keep hair from blowing around</li>
            <li> Works Great, smells great!  No flaking.  I can no longer find this product locally, so purchased it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better than any gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for short hair. I apply it to damp/wet hair then blow dry.  Lots of volume and workable..</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son uses this daily. He has tried gorilla snot and others and likes this best. It is not too stiff. It does leave some gel goo on the child&#x27;s forehead, however.</li>
            <li> hold my hair the best. It holds up well even after i went running and hiking. Don&#x27;t have to fear accidentally brushing against your hair and ruining the gel, this products will still hold true. highly recommend for people who have a active lifestyle but still want their hair done.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but don&#x27;t like the manly smell.  I&#x27;m a female using the product because their&#x27;s nothing else like it on the market in my experience.  Helps to tame those wild gray hairs.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.. Keeps your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite hair gel- sticky and dries nicely..&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice subtle scent- nothing crazy.&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
