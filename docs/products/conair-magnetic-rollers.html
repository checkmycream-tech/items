            <li>Great product, comes with everything as specified.</li>
            <li>great service!Thanks.</li>
            <li>The comb that comes with the kit is very handy for sectioning.</li>
            <li>I have yet to have a successful use of this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend these unless you have incredibly heavy/thick/course/short hair.</li>
            <li>It said it works best for fine hair.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of rollers with a good verity of sizes.  </li>
            <li>This combo is a good deal, and plenty of rollers too.  </li>
            <li>The pins are fairly inexpensive and I have tons lying around at home.  </li>
            <li>Good magnetic rollers.</li>
            <li>But honestly, this is a great set to have at home.</li>
            <li>The variety in size of rollers is good as well.</li>
            <li>These smooth rollers are great!</li>
            <li>Good matirial .</li>
            <li>Good for the prize.</li>
            <li>Good quality and affordable price.</li>
            <li>Good price &amp; good product.</li>
            <li>I had to learn how to use the rollers on my own hair before finally successfully using them.</li>
            <li>good purchase just like the salon uses very cute packaging</li>
            <li>the rolls are okay not the best the clips could have been way more they give u like for one part of the head</li>
            <li>Good set for newbies wish there were more clips though!</li>
            <li>Upon purchasing this product I read the reviews, \\&quot;Great product- Need more pins\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Great product love these rollers</li>
            <li>great product for getting a better blown out look.</li>
            <li>I loved that this roller set had a nice variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and it arrived fast !!!!</li>
            <li>so I suggest using a sit-down hair dryer for best and most comfortable use.</li>
            <li>Prepare to be impressed by how pretty your hair can look with virtually no heat whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Too many rollers!</li>
            <li>Love them !</li>
            <li>These rollers matched with a hot curling iron give the perfect look to your hair.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>using them and a hair dryer bonnet the results were amazing although I did have to purchase additional prong clips.  </li>
            <li>The rat-tail comb is nice and I like the storage bag that everything comes</li>
            <li>I had to use some of my own).</li>
            <li>Even with two clips holding each roller in place, some of the rollers slipped out and my hair did not end up with the nice flowy waves I had been hoping for.</li>
            <li>but I like to look nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice to travel with.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own thing,</li>
            <li>But I wanted to do this on my own.</li>
            <li>But this is the perfect size for shoulder length hair  straight or curly.</li>
            <li>I really liked that they included a rat-tail comb, since with this</li>
            <li>This is a nice pack of magnetic rollers.</li>
            <li>I like this item because it comes in the handy zipper bag</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pack of Rollers with comb and clips</li>
            <li>Nice compact size, but</li>
            <li>A nice setting lotion and the curlers</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s great one!</li>
            <li>Very cool good price.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great price on a good set of rollers!</li>
            <li>I would have liked more clips than what came with the rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These rollers are BETTER than the kind we used in beauty</li>
            <li>, you get great quality rollers in a variety of sizes, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very smooth and it would be helpful if they has some texture.</li>
            <li>Smooth sided - not &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; at all unless you count static cling!  </li>
            <li>You need more clips so the bobby pins will work just fine !</li>
            <li>Very good, I like that it&#x27;s a complete package pins and comb.</li>
            <li>I guess they are ok.</li>
            <li>it worked out a lil better</li>
            <li>Stick to Velcro rollers they will give you a better curl</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more than that, but I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li>I think 12 or so clips so you will need to buy more.  </li>
            <li>These rollers stretch the hair for better drying.  </li>
            <li>BUY more clips too.</li>
            <li>your bump will have a lump :)  </li>
            <li>Bobbie pins work better than the included clips.</li>
            <li>You will need to buy more clips, 30 is too few.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I buy this again, absolutely, its a great price.  </li>
            <li>more so it dries faster.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these rollers....</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought them..</li>
            <li>Im in Love with these.</li>
            <li>I bought these curlers, hoping that I would be able to use them overnight while I slept.</li>
            <li>Curved clips are work better at not leaving the dents.  </li>
            <li>I find myself using more than 3 per roller.</li>
            <li>I would of give it a 5 star if the comb would of been a better material.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and my daughter was pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>A curling iron would be a much better choice.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>The product is okay</li>
            <li>Oh well, we tried them on my mom&#x27;s hair and they seemed to be working better</li>
            <li>An more people seem to come now than before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d better stop writing before I talk myself in to a 1.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>kit is really fantastic!</li>
            <li>Tried these to give me more volume and they dont stay in no matter</li>
            <li>great combo and size variation everytime I wash I set and after my hair is ready for anything .</li>
            <li>Just one imrovement wouuld be longer clips to be able to roll longer hair.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped! :)</li>
            <li>love that the rollers came with the clips.</li>
            <li>Nice and light for a holding curl.</li>
            <li>I wish the seller gave a bit more info on how to use these because a lot of people are having issues stemming from incorrect use.</li>
            <li>They arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>it brings more puns as the rollers</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about this set of rollers by Conair, everything that I heard was right.</li>
            <li>it works perfectly  for medium or  not to long hair.i like it</li>
            <li>As another reviewer state, there is NOTHING magnetic about the rollers, they dont come with nearly enough clips AND they are incredibly slippery.</li>
            <li>If you want a lot of rollers for dirt cheap (that are JUST like the ones that are sold for more at the beauty supply), buy this.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out better than it has been for years, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased this pack with the intent to get back into roller sets as I feel they are a superior alternative to using a curling/flat iron every day, and I have been very pleased with the quality and amount of rollers you receive for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, perfect kit.</li>
            <li>I used to have magnetic rollers that stuck easily to your head.</li>
            <li>I must warn you,you have to learn how to use them on YOUR hair to avoid frustration but overall they are great rollers,you may need more metal clips though</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and leaves my hair with shine</li>
            <li>Easy for travelling.  </li>
            <li>They fall out easily if you&#x27;ve got fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of funny</li>
            <li>Check on YOUTUBE for more wet set ideas and how to get the most from each \\&quot;set\\&quot; hair style wise:)</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give these a shot, but they just do not hold baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product is a huge let-down.</li>
            <li>I use it with a huge box of pin curls clips</li>
            <li>, I use bobby pins to secure the curler.  </li>
            <li>They come with a tail comb and clips to secure the rollers.</li>
            <li>Gave my hair fabulous body.</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my hair with these.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try them during the day, but I can imagine that they work fantastic if you aren&#x27;t going to sleep with them in.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this set.</li>
            <li>The surface is completely smooth which lets my hair just slide off.</li>
            <li>Magnetic rollers ARE smooth and slippery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some fantastic hair days with these babies.</li>
            <li>This is still overall a great product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thus I needed curlers because my old curlers died (Loved them:</li>
            <li>This way I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron or hot rollers which tend to damage my very fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I watched Youtube videos on how to use this the right way, plus read up on it just to make sure.</li>
            <li>If you think you need more than 9 of anyone size of roller you need to buy another set OR get to your nearest beauty supply store and get EXACTLY what you need.</li>
            <li>The only way for this product to be perfect for me and receive 5 stars would be if it included a larger roller size and more pins.    </li>
            <li>but I am so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Great for long hair too.  </li>
            <li>They are light and my hair dries quickly with the added holes.  </li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re what I expected and Im able to make good use of them for roller-setting after washing and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>and it came right out!</li>
            <li>Also, they work great in short hair (with a little skill lol).</li>
            <li>I have a great wet set when Im done.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with enough clips, otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these rollers and hair clips.</li>
            <li>The colors were cool and there were plenty of rollers.</li>
            <li>I threw them, cried a bit out of frustration, cleaned them up and put them back for good.</li>
            <li>but they were pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them much, but they are a pretty good quality to use for straightening hair (I have very curly hair)</li>
            <li>Nice range of sizes in the set and a handy little comb.</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>guess I have to buy some more overall an okay product</li>
            <li>the clips were cheap did not stay put, I ended buying other clips, but for the money it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I had very straight hair!  </li>
            <li>but you can get those anywhere for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>You can buy them pretty cheap at a department store</li>
            <li>It was delivered just on time i love the super fast shipping its exactly what i was looking for. &#x27;</li>
            <li>The curls were good but it does take a longer time to dry.  </li>
            <li>The rollers do not allow you to roll your hair easily nor do they stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>While I do like the price, the amount of rollers you get, and the sizes... Let me just say I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t throw out my old rollers with the assumption these would replace them!</li>
            <li>I prefer to give myself a facial and sit with my bonnet dryer for 30 - 45 minutes until each curl is DRY, works BEST for me.   </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they mean by &#x27;magnetic&#x27;, but if you know how to roll your hair with pins instead of those easy clip-on ones, this is great.</li>
            <li>The smooth rollers made a frizz free curl or with the larger rollers frizz free volume.</li>
            <li>After nearly ruining my hair, I was near tears about how good these look.</li>
            <li>The rattail comb is certainly useful.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the money, considering all that you get with it.  </li>
            <li>This economical magnetic roller set works well for me.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars over just one is that there are tonnnnnssss of rollers with this set, if they worked i would have been thrilled about that.</li>
            <li>Nice for people who have short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>it worth three penny they rip off</li>
            <li>, otherwise the hassle just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about these rollers.</li>
            <li>they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.i think only a pro could effectively use these.</li>
            <li>I would suggest the &amp;#34;velcro&amp;#34; kind for people who have similar hair to me.</li>
            <li>Honestly though the rollers are just a slippery plastic and even putting just a few rollers in, most just fallen right out before I even got a chance to get under the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>There are much better clips available, the clips included are flat and &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Work gr8, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Other than that- its a good value 75 rollers for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>If you use them right it will help create a straight-hair look without all the heat.</li>
            <li>They just slip right out of your hair, then don&#x27;t want to roll at all...correction...</li>
            <li>They slip right out of my hair immediately.</li>
            <li>hair slid right off of these.</li>
            <li>My hair slides right off of them.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use with clips that are included, but I bought extra since I have fine hair that tends to do</li>
            <li>I wish there were more small rollers for shorter hair, but its nice that it came with a comb, i didn&#x27;t notice that when I bought it.</li>
            <li>product is exactly what it advertises to be and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It might be partly because my hair is super straight</li>
            <li>The only positive is the rollers are easy to clean and the storage case is convenient.    </li>
            <li>They do exactly what they were designed to do, period.  </li>
            <li>The temptation to re-wet with setting lotion, gel, mousse etc will give you crisp curls that will cause your hair to break.</li>
            <li>I found these to be very well worth the money for the quantity and sizes.</li>
            <li>There are more than enough of every size.</li>
            <li>If you have never used rollers before try using the magnetic rollers first.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had more smaller rollers.</li>
            <li>The pins weren&#x27;t to big of a deal I can buy more.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>By doing this this was you will have a style that will last longer and more resilient.</li>
            <li>But shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it would work better than my curling iron in making longer lasting curls.</li>
            <li>First, nothing about these were magnetic.</li>
            <li>First, the rollers ARE magnetic.</li>
            <li>and I had more then enough and some.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured &amp; very well packed!</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what was in the picture.</li>
            <li>it has so many rollers and not enough pins .wish</li>
            <li>duh lol -</li>
            <li>I would definintely recommend buying more clips with this order because there is not enough.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered these,  reviews I saw were relatively positive  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice the second tab where you review recent comments rather then the ones Amazon deemed most relevant.  </li>
            <li>If I have the time however, I think it is better for the hair to air dry.</li>
            <li>They are called magnetic not because they actually have magnetic properties, but because hair supposedly sticks to them so they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You would be smart to buy clips.  </li>
            <li>would certainly buy this set again</li>
            <li>so you need to know how to grip them correctly to get a nice tight hold.</li>
            <li>Lastly even though I was able to role my hair and clip it okay, but by morning half of the rollers had fallen out</li>
            <li>what she said: Is a good product, with different sizes the only problem is that there is just 6 o7 of each and most of then are very littel for even a middle large hair, but they work properly.</li>
            <li>I cannot say the same Conair  is a great product and generally not cheap.</li>
            <li>Great but only a few clips</li>
            <li>it worked much better.)&lt;br /&gt;Overview:  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about the metal clips</li>
            <li>I have straight hair.  </li>
            <li>so treating it gently has become a priority.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay in and are a real pain to use...</li>
            <li>It was ship fast and on time.</li>
            <li>I think they should really go the length of the curler</li>
            <li>The comb is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do not hold the curlers very well at all.  </li>
            <li>In the end, it didn&#x27;t really work for my hair.</li>
            <li>These work really well with our hair dryer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very unprofessional product</li>
            <li>Not to mention there are not nearly enough clips provided in the pack to secure the rollers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of us could get them to stay very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure your hair is wet</li>
            <li>They wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair unless I used two clips and even then they were falling out, no matter how much hair I put up.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really have any issues.</li>
            <li>Having the clips really helped</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t enough clips for a full head, so I had to improvise on my first use.  </li>
            <li>Great set, I would suggest buying roller clips or extra long bobby pins, the clips it comes with not long enough to securely hold the roller.</li>
            <li>just wish it came with more clips but other than that</li>
            <li>The barrels of the rollers are too smooth to grip the hair, the clips are not long or strong enough to hold the rollers in place, and there are not enough clips supplied in each kit.  </li>
            <li>The plastic pouch contains several sizes of rollers, more than enough for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase extra clips, or even an extra pack like I did, if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I would order again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use rollers on a regular basis and after reading a lot of other reviews I took one person&#x27;s advice and watched some YouTube videos that kind of helped.  </li>
            <li>I know magnetic does not mean they are magnetized, so I did not expect that.  </li>
            <li>The clips were helpful but kind of hard to use as well.</li>
            <li>They are more firm than other rollers I have purchased, and its easy to set your hair with them.</li>
            <li>I have Breast length hair and a pack of the huge rollers with three cost me roughly $6.</li>
            <li>However the sizes and number of rollers are appropriate if your hair is long enough to hold them in place.</li>
            <li>These are great, only downside is there are not enough clips and the ones provided are not large enough for the hair to stay on the roller.</li>
            <li>(So if you put the first clip in from the left hand side, put the next clip in from the right hand side).</li>
            <li>I have average thickness hair, so it&#x27;s not that I have incredibly fine, wispy hair.</li>
            <li>As many other users said, you need two clips to hold each roller in place and there are not enough clips supplied with the package.</li>
            <li>I tend to go back to my hot rollers for time purposes.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are great however even the largest ones are a bit small for someone with long hair such as myself.</li>
            <li>As my friend began rolling the second section, the rollers in the first section began loosening and falling out.  </li>
            <li>Then, you put THE SECOND  roller in REMOVE THE CLIP FROM THE FIRST ROLLER AND CLIP BOTH OF THE ROLLERS TOGETHER.</li>
            <li>You roll your hair, clip, roll the next section, take out the first clip, and clip the 2 rolls together.</li>
            <li>I am left with full, shiny, romantic curls.</li>
            <li>Four were broken when I opened the package and two more broke the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>You can barely put any hair in them, or they are constantly popping loose, which means you need a whole lot more to do the same job with the old sponge rollers.  </li>
            <li>clip ratio is clearly off-balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Compact, complete with clips and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This package doesn&#x27;t come with nearly enough clips to do your whole head.     </li>
            <li>these rollers make soft wavy curls</li>
            <li>She even used additional clips and hair pins, but all of the curlers had loosened and a couple came out completely.        </li>
            <li>Im gonna have to be old fashioned and use the snap on roller covers to hold those babies in place</li>
            <li>I tried it and so did my mother and my mother&#x27;s friend who is a professional hair dresser.</li>
            <li>so it became her early birthday</li>
            <li>Definitely enough to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li>may give these one more try, when I have at least 8-10 hours to spend on a hairstyle, and an expectation that I will still have to use a curling iron after removing the rollers.</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair you can do it as well just in smal section of the hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it did not come in a zippered pouch as shown and that would be nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, those with thick, lush hair will fare better.      </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and can only fit maybe 10 of these, leaving the other 65 unused.  </li>
            <li>The surface is *very* slick, so I recommend wetting the hair or spraying the hair or roller with hairspray for better traction.</li>
            <li>The rollers I received are slick plastic and in no way made to be held in fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought extra clips which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A giant waste of time to attempt to put them in fine hair.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I put my bonnet on to dry my hair, the hair&amp;#34;unrolled&amp;#34; (not that it ever really rolled)  </li>
            <li>Now I just need a little more practice in puting them in with such long hair.</li>
            <li>You then add another roller, and add a pin to clip that THIRD ROLLER to the SECOND ROLLER, close to the scalp, on the opposite side of the first clip.</li>
            <li>The Texas heatwave has dried and fried my hair BEFORE any hot tools touched it</li>
            <li>First off I am impatient with my hair.</li>
            <li>Rollers are typical and I just needed a large quanity for me and my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair goes to my lower shoulder blades, so not very long by any means</li>
            <li>Clips not long enough for rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great service!Thanks.</li>
            <li> The comb that comes with the kit is very handy for sectioning.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have a successful use of this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend these unless you have incredibly heavy/thick/course/short hair.</li>
            <li> It said it works best for fine hair.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of rollers with a good verity of sizes.  </li>
            <li> This combo is a good deal, and plenty of rollers too.  </li>
            <li> The pins are fairly inexpensive and I have tons lying around at home.  </li>
            <li> Good magnetic rollers.</li>
            <li> But honestly, this is a great set to have at home.</li>
            <li> The variety in size of rollers is good as well.</li>
            <li> These smooth rollers are great!</li>
            <li> Good matirial .</li>
            <li> Good for the prize.</li>
            <li> Good quality and affordable price.</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; good product.</li>
            <li> I had to learn how to use the rollers on my own hair before finally successfully using them.</li>
            <li> good purchase just like the salon uses very cute packaging</li>
            <li> the rolls are okay not the best the clips could have been way more they give u like for one part of the head</li>
            <li> Good set for newbies wish there were more clips though!</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this product I read the reviews, \\&quot;Great product- Need more pins\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great product love these rollers</li>
            <li> great product for getting a better blown out look.</li>
            <li> I loved that this roller set had a nice variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy and it arrived fast !!!!</li>
            <li> so I suggest using a sit-down hair dryer for best and most comfortable use.</li>
            <li> Prepare to be impressed by how pretty your hair can look with virtually no heat whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Too many rollers!</li>
            <li> Love them !</li>
            <li> These rollers matched with a hot curling iron give the perfect look to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> using them and a hair dryer bonnet the results were amazing although I did have to purchase additional prong clips.  </li>
            <li> The rat-tail comb is nice and I like the storage bag that everything comes</li>
            <li> I had to use some of my own).</li>
            <li> Even with two clips holding each roller in place, some of the rollers slipped out and my hair did not end up with the nice flowy waves I had been hoping for.</li>
            <li> but I like to look nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice to travel with.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own thing,</li>
            <li> But I wanted to do this on my own.</li>
            <li> But this is the perfect size for shoulder length hair  straight or curly.</li>
            <li> I really liked that they included a rat-tail comb, since with this</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack of magnetic rollers.</li>
            <li> I like this item because it comes in the handy zipper bag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack of Rollers with comb and clips</li>
            <li> Nice compact size, but</li>
            <li> A nice setting lotion and the curlers</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s great one!</li>
            <li> Very cool good price.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great price on a good set of rollers!</li>
            <li> I would have liked more clips than what came with the rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These rollers are BETTER than the kind we used in beauty</li>
            <li> , you get great quality rollers in a variety of sizes, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very smooth and it would be helpful if they has some texture.</li>
            <li> Smooth sided - not &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; at all unless you count static cling!  </li>
            <li> You need more clips so the bobby pins will work just fine !</li>
            <li> Very good, I like that it&#x27;s a complete package pins and comb.</li>
            <li> I guess they are ok.</li>
            <li> it worked out a lil better</li>
            <li> Stick to Velcro rollers they will give you a better curl</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more than that, but I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li> I think 12 or so clips so you will need to buy more.  </li>
            <li> These rollers stretch the hair for better drying.  </li>
            <li> BUY more clips too.</li>
            <li> your bump will have a lump :)  </li>
            <li> Bobbie pins work better than the included clips.</li>
            <li> You will need to buy more clips, 30 is too few.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would I buy this again, absolutely, its a great price.  </li>
            <li> more so it dries faster.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these rollers....</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought them..</li>
            <li> Im in Love with these.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers, hoping that I would be able to use them overnight while I slept.</li>
            <li> Curved clips are work better at not leaving the dents.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using more than 3 per roller.</li>
            <li> I would of give it a 5 star if the comb would of been a better material.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my daughter was pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> A curling iron would be a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> The product is okay</li>
            <li> Oh well, we tried them on my mom&#x27;s hair and they seemed to be working better</li>
            <li> An more people seem to come now than before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d better stop writing before I talk myself in to a 1.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> kit is really fantastic!</li>
            <li> Tried these to give me more volume and they dont stay in no matter</li>
            <li> great combo and size variation everytime I wash I set and after my hair is ready for anything .</li>
            <li> Just one imrovement wouuld be longer clips to be able to roll longer hair.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped! :)</li>
            <li> love that the rollers came with the clips.</li>
            <li> Nice and light for a holding curl.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller gave a bit more info on how to use these because a lot of people are having issues stemming from incorrect use.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> it brings more puns as the rollers</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this set of rollers by Conair, everything that I heard was right.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly  for medium or  not to long hair.i like it</li>
            <li> As another reviewer state, there is NOTHING magnetic about the rollers, they dont come with nearly enough clips AND they are incredibly slippery.</li>
            <li> If you want a lot of rollers for dirt cheap (that are JUST like the ones that are sold for more at the beauty supply), buy this.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out better than it has been for years, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pack with the intent to get back into roller sets as I feel they are a superior alternative to using a curling/flat iron every day, and I have been very pleased with the quality and amount of rollers you receive for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, perfect kit.</li>
            <li> I used to have magnetic rollers that stuck easily to your head.</li>
            <li> I must warn you,you have to learn how to use them on YOUR hair to avoid frustration but overall they are great rollers,you may need more metal clips though</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and leaves my hair with shine</li>
            <li> Easy for travelling.  </li>
            <li> They fall out easily if you&#x27;ve got fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of funny</li>
            <li> Check on YOUTUBE for more wet set ideas and how to get the most from each \\&quot;set\\&quot; hair style wise:)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give these a shot, but they just do not hold baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge let-down.</li>
            <li> I use it with a huge box of pin curls clips</li>
            <li> , I use bobby pins to secure the curler.  </li>
            <li> They come with a tail comb and clips to secure the rollers.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair fabulous body.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my hair with these.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try them during the day, but I can imagine that they work fantastic if you aren&#x27;t going to sleep with them in.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this set.</li>
            <li> The surface is completely smooth which lets my hair just slide off.</li>
            <li> Magnetic rollers ARE smooth and slippery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some fantastic hair days with these babies.</li>
            <li> This is still overall a great product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thus I needed curlers because my old curlers died (Loved them:</li>
            <li> This way I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron or hot rollers which tend to damage my very fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I watched Youtube videos on how to use this the right way, plus read up on it just to make sure.</li>
            <li> If you think you need more than 9 of anyone size of roller you need to buy another set OR get to your nearest beauty supply store and get EXACTLY what you need.</li>
            <li> The only way for this product to be perfect for me and receive 5 stars would be if it included a larger roller size and more pins.    </li>
            <li> but I am so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair too.  </li>
            <li> They are light and my hair dries quickly with the added holes.  </li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re what I expected and Im able to make good use of them for roller-setting after washing and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> and it came right out!</li>
            <li> Also, they work great in short hair (with a little skill lol).</li>
            <li> I have a great wet set when Im done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with enough clips, otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these rollers and hair clips.</li>
            <li> The colors were cool and there were plenty of rollers.</li>
            <li> I threw them, cried a bit out of frustration, cleaned them up and put them back for good.</li>
            <li> but they were pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them much, but they are a pretty good quality to use for straightening hair (I have very curly hair)</li>
            <li> Nice range of sizes in the set and a handy little comb.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> guess I have to buy some more overall an okay product</li>
            <li> the clips were cheap did not stay put, I ended buying other clips, but for the money it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I had very straight hair!  </li>
            <li> but you can get those anywhere for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> You can buy them pretty cheap at a department store</li>
            <li> It was delivered just on time i love the super fast shipping its exactly what i was looking for. &#x27;</li>
            <li> The curls were good but it does take a longer time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The rollers do not allow you to roll your hair easily nor do they stay in place very well.</li>
            <li> While I do like the price, the amount of rollers you get, and the sizes... Let me just say I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t throw out my old rollers with the assumption these would replace them!</li>
            <li> I prefer to give myself a facial and sit with my bonnet dryer for 30 - 45 minutes until each curl is DRY, works BEST for me.   </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they mean by &#x27;magnetic&#x27;, but if you know how to roll your hair with pins instead of those easy clip-on ones, this is great.</li>
            <li> The smooth rollers made a frizz free curl or with the larger rollers frizz free volume.</li>
            <li> After nearly ruining my hair, I was near tears about how good these look.</li>
            <li> The rattail comb is certainly useful.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the money, considering all that you get with it.  </li>
            <li> This economical magnetic roller set works well for me.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars over just one is that there are tonnnnnssss of rollers with this set, if they worked i would have been thrilled about that.</li>
            <li> Nice for people who have short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> it worth three penny they rip off</li>
            <li> , otherwise the hassle just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about these rollers.</li>
            <li> they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.i think only a pro could effectively use these.</li>
            <li> I would suggest the &amp;#34;velcro&amp;#34; kind for people who have similar hair to me.</li>
            <li> Honestly though the rollers are just a slippery plastic and even putting just a few rollers in, most just fallen right out before I even got a chance to get under the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> There are much better clips available, the clips included are flat and &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Work gr8, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Other than that- its a good value 75 rollers for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> If you use them right it will help create a straight-hair look without all the heat.</li>
            <li> They just slip right out of your hair, then don&#x27;t want to roll at all...correction...</li>
            <li> They slip right out of my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> hair slid right off of these.</li>
            <li> My hair slides right off of them.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use with clips that are included, but I bought extra since I have fine hair that tends to do</li>
            <li> I wish there were more small rollers for shorter hair, but its nice that it came with a comb, i didn&#x27;t notice that when I bought it.</li>
            <li> product is exactly what it advertises to be and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It might be partly because my hair is super straight</li>
            <li> The only positive is the rollers are easy to clean and the storage case is convenient.    </li>
            <li> They do exactly what they were designed to do, period.  </li>
            <li> The temptation to re-wet with setting lotion, gel, mousse etc will give you crisp curls that will cause your hair to break.</li>
            <li> I found these to be very well worth the money for the quantity and sizes.</li>
            <li> There are more than enough of every size.</li>
            <li> If you have never used rollers before try using the magnetic rollers first.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had more smaller rollers.</li>
            <li> The pins weren&#x27;t to big of a deal I can buy more.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> By doing this this was you will have a style that will last longer and more resilient.</li>
            <li> But shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would work better than my curling iron in making longer lasting curls.</li>
            <li> First, nothing about these were magnetic.</li>
            <li> First, the rollers ARE magnetic.</li>
            <li> and I had more then enough and some.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured &amp; very well packed!</li>
            <li> but it is exactly what was in the picture.</li>
            <li> it has so many rollers and not enough pins .wish</li>
            <li> duh lol -</li>
            <li> I would definintely recommend buying more clips with this order because there is not enough.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered these,  reviews I saw were relatively positive  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the second tab where you review recent comments rather then the ones Amazon deemed most relevant.  </li>
            <li> If I have the time however, I think it is better for the hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> They are called magnetic not because they actually have magnetic properties, but because hair supposedly sticks to them so they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> You would be smart to buy clips.  </li>
            <li> would certainly buy this set again</li>
            <li> so you need to know how to grip them correctly to get a nice tight hold.</li>
            <li> Lastly even though I was able to role my hair and clip it okay, but by morning half of the rollers had fallen out</li>
            <li> what she said: Is a good product, with different sizes the only problem is that there is just 6 o7 of each and most of then are very littel for even a middle large hair, but they work properly.</li>
            <li> I cannot say the same Conair  is a great product and generally not cheap.</li>
            <li> Great but only a few clips</li>
            <li> it worked much better.)&lt;br /&gt;Overview:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care about the metal clips</li>
            <li> I have straight hair.  </li>
            <li> so treating it gently has become a priority.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in and are a real pain to use...</li>
            <li> It was ship fast and on time.</li>
            <li> I think they should really go the length of the curler</li>
            <li> The comb is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do not hold the curlers very well at all.  </li>
            <li> In the end, it didn&#x27;t really work for my hair.</li>
            <li> These work really well with our hair dryer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very unprofessional product</li>
            <li> Not to mention there are not nearly enough clips provided in the pack to secure the rollers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of us could get them to stay very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure your hair is wet</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair unless I used two clips and even then they were falling out, no matter how much hair I put up.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really have any issues.</li>
            <li> Having the clips really helped</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough clips for a full head, so I had to improvise on my first use.  </li>
            <li> Great set, I would suggest buying roller clips or extra long bobby pins, the clips it comes with not long enough to securely hold the roller.</li>
            <li> just wish it came with more clips but other than that</li>
            <li> The barrels of the rollers are too smooth to grip the hair, the clips are not long or strong enough to hold the rollers in place, and there are not enough clips supplied in each kit.  </li>
            <li> The plastic pouch contains several sizes of rollers, more than enough for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase extra clips, or even an extra pack like I did, if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I would order again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use rollers on a regular basis and after reading a lot of other reviews I took one person&#x27;s advice and watched some YouTube videos that kind of helped.  </li>
            <li> I know magnetic does not mean they are magnetized, so I did not expect that.  </li>
            <li> The clips were helpful but kind of hard to use as well.</li>
            <li> They are more firm than other rollers I have purchased, and its easy to set your hair with them.</li>
            <li> I have Breast length hair and a pack of the huge rollers with three cost me roughly $6.</li>
            <li> However the sizes and number of rollers are appropriate if your hair is long enough to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> These are great, only downside is there are not enough clips and the ones provided are not large enough for the hair to stay on the roller.</li>
            <li> (So if you put the first clip in from the left hand side, put the next clip in from the right hand side).</li>
            <li> I have average thickness hair, so it&#x27;s not that I have incredibly fine, wispy hair.</li>
            <li> As many other users said, you need two clips to hold each roller in place and there are not enough clips supplied with the package.</li>
            <li> I tend to go back to my hot rollers for time purposes.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are great however even the largest ones are a bit small for someone with long hair such as myself.</li>
            <li> As my friend began rolling the second section, the rollers in the first section began loosening and falling out.  </li>
            <li> Then, you put THE SECOND  roller in REMOVE THE CLIP FROM THE FIRST ROLLER AND CLIP BOTH OF THE ROLLERS TOGETHER.</li>
            <li> You roll your hair, clip, roll the next section, take out the first clip, and clip the 2 rolls together.</li>
            <li> I am left with full, shiny, romantic curls.</li>
            <li> Four were broken when I opened the package and two more broke the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> You can barely put any hair in them, or they are constantly popping loose, which means you need a whole lot more to do the same job with the old sponge rollers.  </li>
            <li> clip ratio is clearly off-balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Compact, complete with clips and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This package doesn&#x27;t come with nearly enough clips to do your whole head.     </li>
            <li> these rollers make soft wavy curls</li>
            <li> She even used additional clips and hair pins, but all of the curlers had loosened and a couple came out completely.        </li>
            <li> Im gonna have to be old fashioned and use the snap on roller covers to hold those babies in place</li>
            <li> I tried it and so did my mother and my mother&#x27;s friend who is a professional hair dresser.</li>
            <li> so it became her early birthday</li>
            <li> Definitely enough to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li> may give these one more try, when I have at least 8-10 hours to spend on a hairstyle, and an expectation that I will still have to use a curling iron after removing the rollers.</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair you can do it as well just in smal section of the hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it did not come in a zippered pouch as shown and that would be nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, those with thick, lush hair will fare better.      </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and can only fit maybe 10 of these, leaving the other 65 unused.  </li>
            <li> The surface is *very* slick, so I recommend wetting the hair or spraying the hair or roller with hairspray for better traction.</li>
            <li> The rollers I received are slick plastic and in no way made to be held in fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought extra clips which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A giant waste of time to attempt to put them in fine hair.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I put my bonnet on to dry my hair, the hair&amp;#34;unrolled&amp;#34; (not that it ever really rolled)  </li>
            <li> Now I just need a little more practice in puting them in with such long hair.</li>
            <li> You then add another roller, and add a pin to clip that THIRD ROLLER to the SECOND ROLLER, close to the scalp, on the opposite side of the first clip.</li>
            <li> The Texas heatwave has dried and fried my hair BEFORE any hot tools touched it</li>
            <li> First off I am impatient with my hair.</li>
            <li> Rollers are typical and I just needed a large quanity for me and my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair goes to my lower shoulder blades, so not very long by any means</li>
            <li> Clips not long enough for rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did not give me the effect that I was looking for, however if you want a loose curl and have time to let your hair dry completely</li>
            <li> and then I either sleep or do work for a few hours to let them dry, or if I dont have as much time, I diffuse them on a low setting.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had to buy certain sizes and it ended up being costly.</li>
            <li> Also they should have come with large bobby pins that will hold the rollers in place not the small clips.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot; clips do not hold at all - at least, they do not hold thin, fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> IF THE HAIR WAS EXTRA LONG MAYBE.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t keep these long enough to try using them with curved clips.</li>
            <li> Second, I should have paid attention to the other reviews stating there were not enough clips, as there AR</li>
            <li> I LOATHED these things, I honestly tossed them out because I was so upset about how bad they were that I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at them.</li>
            <li> These curlers were a complete waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and doesn&#x27;t like pincurls anymore.  </li>
            <li> i like it,but if you have really long hair</li>
            <li> Difficult to wrap long, damp, hair around the smooth sides without it falling off the edges.  </li>
            <li> My hair was somewhat dry, but mostly wet, and after two hours and much blow drying my hair was still a little wet.</li>
            <li> but if you have bobby pins or other types of hair pins,you can use them too if you find out that your metal clips are not enough to roll all your hair.</li>
            <li> I laugh in the face of the 1 and 2 star reviews of these rollers, clearly written by people who failed to do a preliminary Google search on how to even use the rollers!</li>
            <li> I use only 4 big ones on my hair because I&#x27;m lazy and can&#x27;t roll ally hair.</li>
            <li> But, I could not get them to stay in my shoulder length hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long and it was difficult for me to have my hair wrapped in the largest rollers it came with.</li>
            <li> (wet)</li>
            <li> it came faster than i expected...</li>
            <li> These are called \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot;, because wet hair clings to the roller.</li>
            <li> It needs to be wet to cling to the rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair kept slipping of rollers.</li>
            <li> They do not stick to wet hair at all.  </li>
            <li> The rollers perform as expected.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Any grandma or drag queen can show you how to use these, really.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are called magnetic rollers because they stick to your hair when wet,</li>
            <li> Not worth buying if u have long hair</li>
            <li> I understand the word &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; and its meaning here, I just couldn&#x27;t get the clips to stay in my hair, the rollers were too heavy and they were constantly falling out.</li>
            <li> They are not so bad but kind of slick on my hair.</li>
            <li> Connecting and anchoring rollers to each other with ONE clip is a pain...</li>
            <li> I just received my set and discovered that the product description is extremely misleading.</li>
            <li> i recommend to get this packet of magnetic rollers and a bigger size one,because this one have small and medium</li>
            <li> , these are heavy-duty without sharp plastic edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not enough small ones</li>
            <li> There are enough rollers for a very thick head, but not necessarily enough clips.</li>
            <li> They will not stay in your hair with less than two clips, plus you will end up like me...walking and sitting as if you were balancing a book on you head for fear of a roller slipping out of place and falling to the floor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair is too thin for most curlers and this was not an exception.</li>
            <li> I am a biracial girl with VERY curly hair that is difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> These are so not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so I just had a wet head with a few metal clips in it.  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to put THE FIRST roller in and place a clip near the base of the roller close to your scalp to hold it.</li>
            <li> a protruding (and sharp!)</li>
            <li> After about 4 hours, my hair was still slightly damp, but I couldn&#x27;t stand them anymore and took them out.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair, which requires 2 clips to hold 1 roller in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not get this if you have no experience with rollers, or have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it is thick, so it may be that it would work for shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs for my thick, medium- semi long length hair.</li>
            <li> how tight I roll them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me, I was slightly uncomfortable and some of them didn&#x27;t stay in securely overnight due to my tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> it does not cone in a little bag like u see on the picture</li>
            <li> There should be more clips, the ones included are HORRIBLE, and the rollers are not very \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When you buy this purchase a pack of metal clips just in case you run out or lose a few.</li>
            <li> A few rollers have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a few in before they started falling out.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, and I have used curlers in the past that worked.</li>
            <li> That was dumb to add such small clips in this pack.</li>
            <li> It took me a very long time to get all my hair rolled and I do not have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> A huge, expensive, and time-consuming disappointment</li>
            <li> Plastic is too slick to hold hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and use the small to medium size rollers, so I have plenty to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Independently in stores the magnetic rollers for a small quantity are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why they claim them to be magnetic.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether to give it 5 stars or 1?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why they are called magnetic.</li>
            <li> but they are completely slick so my hair just slides off the ends.  </li>
            <li> I was left with shiny, but very limp pathetic curls that refused to do anything pretty.</li>
            <li> It comes with very few clips for holding the rollers.</li>
            <li> Hard to roll</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the hair clipped before it slides off.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time making these stay in.  </li>
            <li> At least they stay on.</li>
            <li> These seem alright, at least they shouldn&#x27;t pull my hair out like the Velcro ones do.</li>
            <li> It seems that a lot of the negative reviews are based on the \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot; idea of the roller.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you may need to purchase some duck bill clips.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4a/b hair and those metal clips</li>
            <li> The clips that come with the rollers are small, and poorly made.  </li>
            <li> The hair clips are very small and don&#x27;t seem to hold the rollers in place</li>
            <li> Saying that, I used very small sections of hair, and these &amp;#34;rollers&amp;#34; still could not keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED -  first FAIL was in the case.</li>
            <li> Too hard to keep in the hair!</li>
            <li> Not sure what part of this roller is supposed to magnetic, but it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> THESE ROLLERS ARE VERY HARD TO MANAGE.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid of buying because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> For the price, you do get a lot of rollers in different size, but to me they are worthless.</li>
            <li> Two of them were broken when I received the pack.  </li>
            <li> The absolute worst look I have gotten after any hair tool.</li>
            <li> Also, they are HARD and difficult to sleep in comfortably, Sorry I purchased these.</li>
            <li> By far the worst product I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> and it was a lil difficult</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Really difficult to use and won&#x27;t stay in hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all!</li>
            <li> Overnight sleeping in them may prove uncomfortable and make you sore</li>
            <li> I had a miserable experience trying to sleep on these, then woke up to find them still wet since, unlike foam rollers or pillow/cushion rollers, these don&#x27;t absorb any of the water in your hair.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> I am not saying this is a bad product, the title is just misleading.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing them away!!! :(</li>
            <li> Very Inconvenient to use...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rollers are, in a word, crap.</li>
            <li> I hate doing it</li>
            <li> i hate it, they don&#x27;t stay in your hair, they are terrible</li>
            <li> The clips are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Therefore my hair looked awful.</li>
            <li> After my terrible experience with these, I bought Conair&#x27;s foam roller set, 48 pack, I think, and they worked like a dream, compared to this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pros:  There are a lot of rollers with a good verity of sizes.  The rat-tail comb is nice and I like the storage bag that everything comes in.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Product name is deceptive.  The alligator clips are too short to pin your hair to the roller. (I used a 2.5&amp;#34; bobby pin and it worked much better.)&lt;br /&gt;Overview:  I don&#x27;t use rollers on a regular basis and after reading a lot of other reviews I took one person&#x27;s advice and watched some YouTube videos that kind of helped.  They did not give me the effect that I was looking for, however if you want a loose curl and have time to let your hair dry completely I guess they are ok.</li>
            <li> The rollers were so glossy that the hair did not stick to it (wet) the clips were cheap did not stay put, I ended buying other clips, but for the money it was a good buy. I have med length hair and it was a lil difficult but on my daughters short it worked out a lil better</li>
            <li> When I ordered these,  reviews I saw were relatively positive  I didn&#x27;t notice the second tab where you review recent comments rather then the ones Amazon deemed most relevant.  Which I&#x27;d noticed before I bothered ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rollers are, in a word, crap. I have the same thing to report as others. Nothing about them is magnetic. Plastic is too slick to hold hair. Not enough clips provided. Clips not long enough for rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> These rollers have no traction on them to keep hair in the curler. Stick to Velcro rollers they will give you a better curl</li>
            <li> I am a biracial girl with VERY curly hair that is difficult to manage. Recently I relaxed and tried a BKT on my hair. I was left with shiny, but very limp pathetic curls that refused to do anything pretty. I began looking into different ways to style my hair without heat and I came upon these magnetic rollers. I LOVE THEM. It takes me about an hour to roll up my entire head and then I either sleep or do work for a few hours to let them dry, or if I dont have as much time, I diffuse them on a low setting. I am left with full, shiny, romantic curls. After nearly ruining my hair, I was near tears about how good these look. There are enough rollers for a very thick head, but not necessarily enough clips. When you buy this purchase a pack of metal clips just in case you run out or lose a few. Prepare to be impressed by how pretty your hair can look with virtually no heat whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These are solid, basic, no-frills rollers.  Can&#x27;t say much more than that, but I&#x27;ll try. They do exactly what they were designed to do, period.  This combo is a good deal, and plenty of rollers too.  I don&#x27;t really care about the metal clips, I use bobby pins to secure the curler.  The rattail comb is certainly useful.  I have shoulder-length hair and use the small to medium size rollers, so I have plenty to get the job done.  This is worth the money, considering all that you get with it.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair.  Thus I needed curlers because my old curlers died (Loved them: Remington All That!) and they seem to be discontinued.  These curlers were a complete waste of time and money.  They did not want to stay in, plus the clips would start to tangle in my hair. After struggling to keep the curlers in, applying product, and using a blow dryer....I had very straight hair!  Don&#x27;t waste your time if you have straight hair...these DO NOT work!</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this product I read the reviews, \\&quot;Great product- Need more pins\\&quot;. I cannot say the same Conair  is a great product and generally not cheap. I have Breast length hair and a pack of the huge rollers with three cost me roughly $6. The pins are fairly inexpensive and I have tons lying around at home.  Over all this is an Excellent buy both in Cost and Quality.</li>
            <li> There are a LOT of rollers but they are plastic and not magnetic at all.  They set only comes with I think 12 or so clips so you will need to buy more.  Honestly though the rollers are just a slippery plastic and even putting just a few rollers in, most just fallen right out before I even got a chance to get under the blow dryer.  It&#x27;s kind of funny the clips stayed in but the rollers didn&#x27;t.  so I just had a wet head with a few metal clips in it.  I suggest getting better/longer clips with this set.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of rollers. They are more firm than other rollers I have purchased, and its easy to set your hair with them. They come with a tail comb and clips to secure the rollers. Gave my hair fabulous body.</li>
            <li> received my roller pack today..it came faster than i expected...just wish it came with more clips but other than that a great purchase</li>
            <li> Good magnetic rollers. Too many rollers! I use only 4 big ones on my hair because I&#x27;m lazy and can&#x27;t roll ally hair.</li>
            <li> Hi, I received the product on time. Conair is a trusted brand.These rollers stretch the hair for better drying.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> All in one. its great and they store well</li>
            <li> This economical magnetic roller set works well for me. It has an assortment of roller sizes (54 rollers, 9 each of 6 different sizes), a rat tail comb and not nearly enough clips (30). If you think you need more than 9 of anyone size of roller you need to buy another set OR get to your nearest beauty supply store and get EXACTLY what you need. Connecting and anchoring rollers to each other with ONE clip is a pain...BUY more clips too. The rollers with the snap-on covers, you can get at your local drug store, are easier to use BUT the covers leave a ridged impression on each curl...your bump will have a lump :)  I have shoulder length curly, wavy, frizzy hair depending on the weather conditions. The Texas heatwave has dried and fried my hair BEFORE any hot tools touched it so treating it gently has become a priority. These rollers part of the gameplan. These are called \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot;, because wet hair clings to the roller. I like these, the accessories and plastic case to keep it all organized. The only improvements I have is to include another 30 clips AND a triangle hair net to hold the rollers on your head.  A suggestion is to keep a water-filled spritzer bottle around while you roll your hair. It needs to be wet to cling to the rollers. The temptation to re-wet with setting lotion, gel, mousse etc will give you crisp curls that will cause your hair to break. Once your hair is rolled, drying it sitting under a dryer, a diffuser blow dryer or air drying will deliver curls and body. I prefer to give myself a facial and sit with my bonnet dryer for 30 - 45 minutes until each curl is DRY, works BEST for me.   Check on YOUTUBE for more wet set ideas and how to get the most from each \\&quot;set\\&quot; hair style wise:)</li>
            <li> Not sure what part of this roller is supposed to magnetic, but it&#x27;s useless.  They don&#x27;t stay in and are a real pain to use... would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with enough clips, otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It has plenty of rollers, comes with a comb, and has the professional-style hair pins.  The only way for this product to be perfect for me and receive 5 stars would be if it included a larger roller size and more pins.    For all the rollers, they should provide enough pins for all of them (yes you might not use them all at once, but you might lose some along the way. Plus there just weren&#x27;t enough pins for my set. I had to use some of my own). My hair goes to my lower shoulder blades, so not very long by any means and I found that there weren&#x27;t enough big rollers.    But honestly, this is a great set to have at home.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly. Product received as advertised.  For the price, you get a variety of roller shapes. Bobbie pins work better than the included clips. Happy Customer!</li>
            <li> Rollers are slippery and do not stay in my hair. It took me a very long time to get all my hair rolled and I do not have very thick hair. Nothing about the product is magnetic. As many other users said, you need two clips to hold each roller in place and there are not enough clips supplied with the package. Even with two clips holding each roller in place, some of the rollers slipped out and my hair did not end up with the nice flowy waves I had been hoping for. I wish I had bought Velcro rollers instead.</li>
            <li> Independently in stores the magnetic rollers for a small quantity are expensive.  I found these to be very well worth the money for the quantity and sizes.</li>
            <li> I loved that this roller set had a nice variety of sizes.  I for once I had plenty of rollers for my hair.  I did not run out of the sizes I needed.  The price point of these rollers is very attractive.  The cons of this set, is I don&#x27;t understand what is magnetic in this set.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything being magnetic.  You will need to buy more clips, 30 is too few.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again, absolutely, its a great price.  I would add some clips to your purchase so you have plenty of clips to keep that roller set in place.</li>
            <li> A few rollers have a protruding (and sharp!) plastic nub on the end. There aren&#x27;t enough clips for a full head, so I had to improvise on my first use.  The surface is *very* slick, so I recommend wetting the hair or spraying the hair or roller with hairspray for better traction. Don&#x27;t even try to sleep in these! They won&#x27;t break, but they definitely won&#x27;t compress either. Overall, a great price on a good set of rollers!</li>
            <li> This is awesome it has everything inside plus it has clips too. It was ship fast and on time. I enjoy doing my hair with these.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge let-down. As another reviewer state, there is NOTHING magnetic about the rollers, they dont come with nearly enough clips AND they are incredibly slippery. They will not stay in your hair with less than two clips, plus you will end up like me...walking and sitting as if you were balancing a book on you head for fear of a roller slipping out of place and falling to the floor. Save your money and buy velcro rollers instead.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife who is from the Dominican Republic and she loves them. There are more than enough of every size. Great product!</li>
            <li> Could use my pins for the rollers but miner setback otherwise rollers are great</li>
            <li> These are so not worth the money.  You can barely put any hair in them, or they are constantly popping loose, which means you need a whole lot more to do the same job with the old sponge rollers.  I wish I would not have purchased them.</li>
            <li> The smooth rollers made a frizz free curl or with the larger rollers frizz free volume. I was very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife that what she said: Is a good product, with different sizes the only problem is that there is just 6 o7 of each and most of then are very littel for even a middle large hair, but they work properly.</li>
            <li> First off I am impatient with my hair. I hate doing it but I like to look nice.  These rollers gave me the best hair I&#x27;ve had in months. I used the big curlers on shoulder length hair and I was amazed at the volume. I just wish the metal clips were longer. I think they should really go the length of the curler so I can spread out the piece of hair more so it dries faster. I also like the variety of sizes so I can have options.</li>
            <li> I must not have gotten the feel of these. I used to have magnetic rollers that stuck easily to your head. Can&#x27;t get these to do that.</li>
            <li> Nice to travel with.  Compact, complete with clips and sturdy.  Not flimsy like some brands</li>
            <li> Maybe i didn&#x27;t read the description well enough or something but these are not at all what i was excepting. I don&#x27;t know that i will use them at all. They aren&#x27;t magnetic like claimed. The only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars over just one is that there are tonnnnnssss of rollers with this set, if they worked i would have been thrilled about that.</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this set of rollers by Conair, everything that I heard was right. The amount of rollers for the price is a great value, let alone be it by Conair. The comb that comes with the kit is very handy for sectioning. The variety in size of rollers is good as well. My only dislike with this product was that there was not nearly enough clips to do my entire head. I have thick, long hair, which requires 2 clips to hold 1 roller in place. If there was 40 clips in this package, it would be perfect. Still, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Now, I did use this product correctly. Unfortunately my hair is too thin for most curlers and this was not an exception.</li>
            <li> I dare you to use them all.  I have shoulder length hair and can only fit maybe 10 of these, leaving the other 65 unused.  If you want a lot of rollers for dirt cheap (that are JUST like the ones that are sold for more at the beauty supply), buy this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple months ago. I am not a pro at roller sets but they were pretty easy to use. I like the case they come in for storage and the only thing I would recommend if you buy this is to get some extra clips. This package doesn&#x27;t come with nearly enough clips to do your whole head.     Happy Hair care!</li>
            <li> These smooth rollers are great! The plastic pouch contains several sizes of rollers, more than enough for my shoulder length hair. They are easy to use with clips that are included, but I bought extra since I have fine hair that tends to do it&#x27;s own thing, not what I want it to do. I am so glad I found these rollers.... couldn&#x27;t get them in stores locally. This way I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron or hot rollers which tend to damage my very fine, color-treated hair. LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001KYW7KQ Conair 61121n Magnetic Rollers, 75 Pack]]</li>
            <li> Revive on time . Good matirial .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these rollers and hair clips. My hair kept slipping of rollers. I think I would pass on them and keep the Velcro Rollers instead.  At least they stay on.</li>
            <li> Pros- Tons of curlers in the pack.  I could curl three people&#x27;s hair and still have leftovers.  They are light and my hair dries quickly with the added holes.  The comb is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- The clips are terrible.  Four were broken when I opened the package and two more broke the first time I used them.  You would be smart to buy clips.  They do not hold the curlers very well at all.  Also, I do not understand why they are considered magnetic.  They do not stick to wet hair at all.  They are just plastic tubes.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED -  first FAIL was in the case. I could not get the zipper to work so I ended up having to cut it open. This then ruined it for future storage of rollers. Second, I should have paid attention to the other reviews stating there were not enough clips, as there AR NOT. Lastly even though I was able to role my hair and clip it okay, but by morning half of the rollers had fallen out so I had some curls but A LOT of strait hair as it did not stay rolled overnight. Also, they are HARD and difficult to sleep in comfortably, Sorry I purchased these.</li>
            <li> The package has every possible imagined size. and besides it comes with the clips to use with the rollers. Good for the prize. would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is cheaper than buying them in the store. The colors were cool and there were plenty of rollers. Not enough clips of course but you can get those anywhere for pretty cheap. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> So slippery!!! I couldn&#x27;t even wrap my hair around them and my hair is longer is shoulder length. For the price, you do get a lot of rollers in different size, but to me they are worthless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s magnetic about it. Do you? I&#x27;m talking to the maker. Also the clips should of been a lot longer. That was dumb to add such small clips in this pack.</li>
            <li> I can never get this to hold. Maybe if I asked a stylist to do it. But I wanted to do this on my own.</li>
            <li> Rollers are typical and I just needed a large quanity for me and my daughters hair.  I would have liked more clips than what came with the rollers.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and looks just like the photo. I have not used this product yet but I am so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I like the rollers.  You get a lot of sizes, plenty to finish the job.  I gave it a 4 because there are definately not enough pins included.  You can buy them pretty cheap at a department store so it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I was prepared for that after reading the review.  The curls were good but it does take a longer time to dry.  I tend to go back to my hot rollers for time purposes.  If I have the time however, I think it is better for the hair to air dry. I like the smoothness of the rollers, they don&#x27;t get tangled up in the hair. Read the reviews and you will find some great tips on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is great for storage and the comb that comes with it is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what it advertises to be and worth the money.</li>
            <li> NO- THESE ROLLERS ARE VERY HARD TO MANAGE. I  WISH I COULD HAVE A REFUND!&lt;br /&gt;ONLY WOULD PROBABLY WORKK IF THE HAIR WAS EXTRA LONG MAYBE.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, these rollers are not actually magnetic.. it&#x27;s just the style of roller.  They&#x27;re standard and they do their job.  Great value!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and doesn&#x27;t like pincurls anymore.  these rollers make soft wavy curls and I&#x27;m glad I bought them..the extra clips etc are a bonus. too.  thank you</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best I&#x27;ve used on my hair.  By utilizing these instead of the self-grip rollers my hair comes out sleek and curly.  After 20 mins. using them and a hair dryer bonnet the results were amazing although I did have to purchase additional prong clips.  If you have never used rollers before try using the magnetic rollers first.  Believe me if you have curly hair and you are using those self-grip ones you could end up having to pull on your hair just to get those darn things out.</li>
            <li> Received it product in a timely manner. The rollers perform as expected. I like the fact the it comes with a come and clips.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more smaller rollers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them much, but they are a pretty good quality to use for straightening hair (I have very curly hair)</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Im in Love with these. I was a little afraid of buying because of the reviews. But this is the perfect size for shoulder length hair  straight or curly. The pins weren&#x27;t to big of a deal I can buy more. I recommended this product</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these rollers to anyone! There should be more clips, the ones included are HORRIBLE, and the rollers are not very \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot;. While I do like the price, the amount of rollers you get, and the sizes... Let me just say I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t throw out my old rollers with the assumption these would replace them!</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers from India.I must warn you,you have to learn how to use them on YOUR hair to avoid frustration but overall they are great rollers,you may need more metal clips though but if you have bobby pins or other types of hair pins,you can use them too if you find out that your metal clips are not enough to roll all your hair.Great product,i don&#x27;t regret buying it.I had to learn how to use the rollers on my own hair before finally successfully using them.There are plenty of tutorials to help you on Youtube,coupled with your own experiences you will learn what works best for you.It&#x27;s great for stretching and curling hair without heat.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more small rollers for shorter hair, but its nice that it came with a comb, i didn&#x27;t notice that when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers, hoping that I would be able to use them overnight while I slept. Unfortunately, for me, I was slightly uncomfortable and some of them didn&#x27;t stay in securely overnight due to my tossing and turning. I have yet to try them during the day, but I can imagine that they work fantastic if you aren&#x27;t going to sleep with them in.</li>
            <li> It said it works best for fine hair. I watched Youtube videos on how to use this the right way, plus read up on it just to make sure. In the end, it didn&#x27;t really work for my hair. It might be partly because my hair is super straight and it&#x27;s difficult to keep it wavy/curled, but no-brand Department store curlers worked better on my hair than this set. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and leaves my hair with shine</li>
            <li> i ordered this rollers and sent to my aunt in Houston so she can bring it back while returning to Nigeria. It was delivered just on time i love the super fast shipping its exactly what i was looking for. &#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t stay in.  returned.</li>
            <li> I use them often... You need more clips so the bobby pins will work just fine ! Love them ! Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li> Too hard to keep in the hair!</li>
            <li> they suck. i hate it, they don&#x27;t stay in your hair, they are terrible</li>
            <li> Work gr8, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great variety.  Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice for people who have short to medium hair. My hair is pretty long and it was difficult for me to have my hair wrapped in the largest rollers it came with.</li>
            <li> These rollers matched with a hot curling iron give the perfect look to your hair. By doing this this was you will have a style that will last longer and more resilient.</li>
            <li> One of every size you could need. These work really well with our hair dryer. I would recommend this item</li>
            <li> These seem alright, at least they shouldn&#x27;t pull my hair out like the Velcro ones do. Fingers crossed</li>
            <li> This is one of the best magnetic roller sets I&#x27;ve seen. In the past I have had to buy certain sizes and it ended up being costly. This set comes with plenty of rollers (My hair shoulder length), the clips and a comb. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. If you use them right it will help create a straight-hair look without all the heat. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I sent them back.  I know magnetic does not mean they are magnetized, so I did not expect that.  But, I could not get them to stay in my shoulder length hair, wet or dry.  The clips that come with the rollers are small, and poorly made.  Two of them were broken when I received the pack.  There are much better clips available, the clips included are flat and &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; the hair, so you can see where they were when you take the rollers out.  Curved clips are work better at not leaving the dents.  But I didn&#x27;t keep these long enough to try using them with curved clips.</li>
            <li> These are just plastic rollers with metal clips. The name magnetic rollers suggests that there is something magnetic about them? However the sizes and number of rollers are appropriate if your hair is long enough to hold them in place. The plastic is very smooth and it would be helpful if they has some texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they mean by &#x27;magnetic&#x27;, but if you know how to roll your hair with pins instead of those easy clip-on ones, this is great. I really liked that they included a rat-tail comb, since with this I&#x27;ve started to wet-set my hair, it is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it did not come in a zippered pouch as shown and that would be nice for traveling.  But shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> The rollers are great however even the largest ones are a bit small for someone with long hair such as myself. The hair clips are very small and don&#x27;t seem to hold the rollers in place I find myself using more than 3 per roller.</li>
            <li> Good quality and affordable price.</li>
            <li> I would like my money back it&#x27;s very unprofessional product I would not recommend it it worth three penny they rip off</li>
            <li> I would of give it a 5 star if the comb would of been a better material.</li>
            <li> Great product love these rollers</li>
            <li> Can someone please tell me why these are called Magnetic?  I just received my set and discovered that the product description is extremely misleading.</li>
            <li> basic set of rollers do the trick like the case they come in too to keep it all organized..good deal</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack of magnetic rollers. I bought extra clips which I highly recommend. Now I just need a little more practice in puting them in with such long hair.</li>
            <li> They just slip right out of your hair, then don&#x27;t want to roll at all...correction...they roll...without your hair! By far the worst product I have ever purchased! I do NOT recommend  this product to anyone. I threw them, cried a bit out of frustration, cleaned them up and put them back for good. I&#x27;d return them but I have not the time!</li>
            <li> Good Quality for the price! These are great, only downside is there are not enough clips and the ones provided are not large enough for the hair to stay on the roller. If you have thick hair you may need to purchase some duck bill clips. The comb is a great edition! I enjoy this set.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets as I wanted to use the smallest rollers in the pack, but there were not enough in one kit.  A friend, who is a licensed beautician, rolled my hair.  As my friend began rolling the second section, the rollers in the first section began loosening and falling out.  She even used additional clips and hair pins, but all of the curlers had loosened and a couple came out completely.        The barrels of the rollers are too smooth to grip the hair, the clips are not long or strong enough to hold the rollers in place, and there are not enough clips supplied in each kit.  The \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot; clips do not hold at all - at least, they do not hold thin, fine, straight hair.  Perhaps, those with thick, lush hair will fare better.      The only positive is the rollers are easy to clean and the storage case is convenient.    A huge, expensive, and time-consuming disappointment and... I had to hide my hair for awhile.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my daughter was pleased with the product.  It was as described and great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> Smooth sided - not &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; at all unless you count static cling!  Difficult to wrap long, damp, hair around the smooth sides without it falling off the edges.  Not enough clips since you&#x27;ll need to use 2 per roller.  Will go into next garage sale!</li>
            <li> I use these rollers with Keratin Intensive RX Restructuring serum. My hair comes out better than it has been for years, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> They did not work well for me</li>
            <li> Before I review this product, know that I have mid length, on the thinker side hair!!  Saying that, I used very small sections of hair, and these &amp;#34;rollers&amp;#34; still could not keep the hair in place. I bought longer hair pins, thinking it would help. But as soon as I put my bonnet on to dry my hair, the hair&amp;#34;unrolled&amp;#34; (not that it ever really rolled)  and it came right out! I&#x27;m really not sure why they claim them to be magnetic. I thought the clips they sold with this product, were possibly the magnets. If that&#x27;s the case, they couldn&#x27;t pick up dust! I would NOT buy this product!!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay in my hair at all. A total waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother with these. A curling iron would be a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love these. Only thing is, they don&#x27;t come with enough pins.</li>
            <li> Delivered as pictured. The rollers feel durable but don&#x27;t come with the snap holders. It came with 20 duck bill clips and a rat tailed comb.</li>
            <li> It is such a PAIN putting these rollers in with the metal clips provided. Not to mention there are not nearly enough clips provided in the pack to secure the rollers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that the rollers themselves work, but Im gonna have to be old fashioned and use the snap on roller covers to hold those babies in place, otherwise the hassle just isn&#x27;t worth it. I have thick 4a/b hair and those metal clips ain&#x27;t gonna cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is if you like to roll your hair up with ease, do not purchase.</li>
            <li> Beware- there is nothing magnetic about these. Rollers are plastic and you need to use two clips to hold it. I am not saying this is a bad product, the title is just misleading. Other than that- its a good value 75 rollers for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> The product is okay it does not cone in a little bag like u see on the picture the rolls are okay not the best the clips could have been way more they give u like for one part of the head guess I have to buy some more overall an okay product</li>
            <li> They are not so bad but kind of slick on my hair. Hard to roll</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would work better than my curling iron in making longer lasting curls. I was very wrong. I don&#x27;t know if it is the product or my hair but it wouldn&#x27;t work. I have long thick hair, and I have used curlers in the past that worked. But for some reason I couldn&#x27;t get the rollers to stay. I tried it and so did my mother and my mother&#x27;s friend who is a professional hair dresser. None of us could get them to stay very long.&lt;br /&gt; Oh well, we tried them on my mom&#x27;s hair and they seemed to be working better so it became her early birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not get this if you have no experience with rollers, or have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether to give it 5 stars or 1? Yes my daughter is now out of my hair about it(pardon the pun), but in the same breath it&#x27;s turned my house in to a beauty salon, I&#x27;m wondering now if I should start charging booth rental fees. An more people seem to come now than before so I guess they work great.... I&#x27;d better stop writing before I talk myself in to a 1.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about these rollers. They fall out easily if you&#x27;ve got fine hair.  Gave mine away.</li>
            <li> Definitely enough to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give these a shot, but they just do not hold baby fine hair. I&#x27;d get a few in before they started falling out. I do not recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers I received are slick plastic and in no way made to be held in fine hair. I cannot for the life of me figure out how they are marketed as &#x27;magnetic.&#x27; They slip right out of my hair immediately. Useless. I should have returned them, but did not because the &#x27;zipper&#x27; on the plastic package would not unzip, so I cut open the package with scissors. My mistake. Unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought these were velcro, but they aren&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s hard to get the hair clipped before it slides off.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair too.  Just be sure your hair is wet so it will snug up against the roller then put clips in to hold in place.</li>
            <li> Great set, I would suggest buying roller clips or extra long bobby pins, the clips it comes with not long enough to securely hold the roller.</li>
            <li> i like it,but if you have really long hair i recommend to get this packet of magnetic rollers and a bigger size one,because this one have small and medium size.but it works perfectly  for medium or  not to long hair.i like it</li>
            <li> I read a bit about magnetic rollers before deciding to purchase these. They are called magnetic not because they actually have magnetic properties, but because hair supposedly sticks to them so they are easy to use.  NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair slid right off of these. It was all I could do to actually roll my hair. The clips were helpful but kind of hard to use as well. After about 4 hours, my hair was still slightly damp, but I couldn&#x27;t stand them anymore and took them out. The absolute worst look I have gotten after any hair tool. My husband even said it looked bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may give these one more try, when I have at least 8-10 hours to spend on a hairstyle, and an expectation that I will still have to use a curling iron after removing the rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why they are called magnetic. nothing is magnetic or metallic about them. they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.i think only a pro could effectively use these.</li>
            <li> I have a great wet set when Im done. It gives me define curls and I love it. If you have natural hair you can do it as well just in smal section of the hair.</li>
            <li> I laugh in the face of the 1 and 2 star reviews of these rollers, clearly written by people who failed to do a preliminary Google search on how to even use the rollers! Any grandma or drag queen can show you how to use these, really.&lt;br /&gt;These rollers are BETTER than the kind we used in beauty school!&lt;br /&gt;This kit is really fantastic! I purchased this pack with the intent to get back into roller sets as I feel they are a superior alternative to using a curling/flat iron every day, and I have been very pleased with the quality and amount of rollers you receive for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike cheaper rollers, like you might find at Sally&#x27;s, these are heavy-duty without sharp plastic edges.&lt;br /&gt;The way they come packaged is very tidy, and I was quite impressed also with the quality of the double-prong clips provided and tailcomb. I wouldn&#x27;t rely solely on the clips provided though, as the roller:clip ratio is clearly off-balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly buy this set again, you get great quality rollers in a variety of sizes, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time making these stay in.  So did my stylist.</li>
            <li> Really difficult to use and won&#x27;t stay in hair. The surface is completely smooth which lets my hair just slide off.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair. Tried these to give me more volume and they dont stay in no matter how tight I roll them. I would suggest the &amp;#34;velcro&amp;#34; kind for people who have similar hair to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I wanted great combo and size variation everytime I wash I set and after my hair is ready for anything .</li>
            <li> Great rollers and kit at an awesome price. I would recommend to anyone. Just one imrovement wouuld be longer clips to be able to roll longer hair. Other than that, perfect kit. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> First, nothing about these were magnetic. They wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair unless I used two clips and even then they were falling out, no matter how much hair I put up. My hair was somewhat dry, but mostly wet, and after two hours and much blow drying my hair was still a little wet. Therefore my hair looked awful. I do NOT recommend these.</li>
            <li> It seems that a lot of the negative reviews are based on the \\&quot;magnetic\\&quot; idea of the roller. First, the rollers ARE magnetic. They are called magnetic rollers because they stick to your hair when wet, not because they are supposed to stick to themselves. And, if you do not know how to roller set your hair with these rollers, they are going to fall out. Magnetic rollers ARE smooth and slippery so you need to know how to grip them correctly to get a nice tight hold. You are supposed to put THE FIRST roller in and place a clip near the base of the roller close to your scalp to hold it. Then, you put THE SECOND  roller in REMOVE THE CLIP FROM THE FIRST ROLLER AND CLIP BOTH OF THE ROLLERS TOGETHER. You then add another roller, and add a pin to clip that THIRD ROLLER to the SECOND ROLLER, close to the scalp, on the opposite side of the first clip. (So if you put the first clip in from the left hand side, put the next clip in from the right hand side). You keep doing this method until you reach the back, or sides of your head, depending on how you roll your hair. I suggest looking up tutorials online. I was just looking at some of these reviews and it dawned on me that maybe people just don&#x27;t know what they are doing. Hope this helped! :)</li>
            <li> I like this item because it comes in the handy zipper bag so you can always use it over and over again. I have shoulder lenght hair and I had more then enough and some. Good price &amp; good product. I love it!</li>
            <li> great product for getting a better blown out look. love that the rollers came with the clips.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great. Easy for travelling.  Georgeous a really really great product! I&#x27;m loving it. Conair is a great brand</li>
            <li> Great but only a few clips</li>
            <li> This is a nice pack of Rollers with comb and clips I can now keep everything in one pack I think the clips are a bit too short.</li>
            <li> Dosnt grip hair ! Not worth buying if u have long hair</li>
            <li> Nice and light for a holding curl. Don&#x27;t pull your hair, and stay in place with or without a hair net.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller gave a bit more info on how to use these because a lot of people are having issues stemming from incorrect use. These are magnetic in the way that the curlers stick together- not to your hair. You roll your hair, clip, roll the next section, take out the first clip, and clip the 2 rolls together. It takes some getting used to but I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so I didn&#x27;t really have any issues. Before ordering them I suggest doing some googling/YouTubing for some tutorials. Also, they work great in short hair (with a little skill lol). They arrived fast and in great condition. I would order again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice compact size, but product does not work well. I have yet to have a successful use of this product. I have long hair and it is thick, so it may be that it would work for shorter, thinner hair. It comes with very few clips for holding the rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some fantastic hair days with these babies. A nice setting lotion and the curlers and I&#x27;m looking great! I use it with a huge box of pin curls clips and I have no problems. Nice range of sizes in the set and a handy little comb. Had to buy extra clips but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured &amp; very well packed! Awesome quality product, creates beautiful curls! Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s great one!</li>
            <li> Great product, comes with everything as specified.</li>
            <li> Good set for newbies wish there were more clips though!</li>
            <li> I LOATHED these things, I honestly tossed them out because I was so upset about how bad they were that I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at them. I understand the word &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; and its meaning here, I just couldn&#x27;t get the clips to stay in my hair, the rollers were too heavy and they were constantly falling out. I have average thickness hair, so it&#x27;s not that I have incredibly fine, wispy hair. I had a miserable experience trying to sleep on these, then woke up to find them still wet since, unlike foam rollers or pillow/cushion rollers, these don&#x27;t absorb any of the water in your hair. After my terrible experience with these, I bought Conair&#x27;s foam roller set, 48 pack, I think, and they worked like a dream, compared to this. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend these unless you have incredibly heavy/thick/course/short hair. My opinion, anyway.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but it is exactly what was in the picture.</li>
            <li> Not enough small ones</li>
            <li> The rollers do not allow you to roll your hair easily nor do they stay in place very well. Not happy with this product at all!</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs for my thick, medium- semi long length hair. They&#x27;re what I expected and Im able to make good use of them for roller-setting after washing and conditioning my hair. Overnight sleeping in them may prove uncomfortable and make you sore so I suggest using a sit-down hair dryer for best and most comfortable use. Be sure to purchase extra clips, or even an extra pack like I did, if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Having the clips really helped</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Very cool good price.I just don&#x27;t understand y it has so many rollers and not enough pins .wish it brings more puns as the rollers it has!!!overall good purchase just like the salon uses very cute packaging</li>
            <li> I must say this product / case came with a lot of rollers in the pack - 75 duh lol - but there were not enough clips in this package.  I would definintely recommend buying more clips with this order because there is not enough.  I had to use some bobby pins in my hair to improvise to hold the rollers once I ran out of silver clips that the pack comes with.  This is still overall a great product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very Inconvenient to use... I ended up throwing them away!!! :( it comes with a brush and clips tho, I ended up keeping the clips</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work for me. My hair slides right off of them.</li>
            <li> great service!Thanks.</li>
            <li> Came on time. A lot of rollers so you won&#x27;t run out, and the bonus of different sizes. Like that it came with a comb and clips. Not enough clips though.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold these rollers in place. A giant waste of time to attempt to put them in fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very good, I like that it&#x27;s a complete package pins and comb. I also like the variety in the sizes for big curls or smaller curls etc. I&#x27;m happy and it arrived fast !!!!</li>
            <li> I was searching for rollers that didn&#x27;t pull out my hair like the velcro rollers do.  These looked like the ones I used to use 30+ years ago but they are completely slick so my hair just slides off the ends.  Also they should have come with large bobby pins that will hold the rollers in place not the small clips.  I tried to put a clip on both ends but there isn&#x27;t room for them if you are placing the rollers close together.  I don&#x27;t know why they call them &#x27;MAGNETIC&#x27;????  It&#x27;s total misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
