            <li>This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my wife and I have found this to be a better (and painless) &amp;#34;intimate lubricant&amp;#34; than any of the purpose-made products we tried.  </li>
            <li>This replaces Advanced Healing before, but is not as good and effective as AH was.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot brands of hand cream, this is by far the best considering its effectiveness and its price.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it successfully and happily for several years.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free!  </li>
            <li>I have many kinds of hand cream, this is among my favorites.</li>
            <li>Most importantly is that this won&#x27; get my hands oilly -</li>
            <li>The original was just better.</li>
            <li>Easy size too - fits in the purse and the bag that goes out to the barn with me easily.</li>
            <li>Product shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got these early, great value, great lotion...I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Very good product for dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, greaseless, goes into my skin, and I have it in every room.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hand creams, but none have been as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>The original, Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream, had the ingredients that I&#x27;ve listed below in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now applying Urea and Dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride to my skin, where I wasn&#x27;t applying them to my skin with the original version.</li>
            <li>This is the list of the ORIGINAL formula ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Steareth 21, Dimethicone, Petrolatum, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Tapioca Starch, Stearic Acid, Glycine Soja Sterol (Soybean), Lecithin, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Stearyl Stearate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Ethylene Brassylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide.</li>
            <li>it is one of the best products for dry hands and serious problems , use it and you will be happy</li>
            <li>cuz I don&#x27;t really wanna buy in pack of 6 although I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soothing and has worked the best of all the hand creams I have tried even the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>(to save the shipping charge) and keep them handy in various places in the house - coffee table, desk, night table, kitchen, bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I used to get cracks in my hands --- like spontaneous paper cuts --- all over my knuckles, cuticles, back of my hand, palms, and lips.  </li>
            <li>But, it was still worth it</li>
            <li>I tried many different products including prescription hand salve prescribed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Although some of the ingredients are the same, the packaging and the original title here lead you to believe you are getting the original formula.  </li>
            <li>A good chunk gets wasted and unused.</li>
            <li>These are normally $3.49 per bottle and this contains 6!!</li>
            <li>The new version, Vaseline intensive CARE advanced repair hand cream, is the new, &#x27;reformulated&#x27; version of Vaseline Intensive RESCUE Healing Hand Cream.  </li>
            <li>It has no greasy feeling and soaks into your skin quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>As long as I apply it daily, the skin looks and feels good which is about all that I can ask.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s not nearly as good or as effective as the original version.</li>
            <li>Mostly in the winter my hands get very dry</li>
            <li>It really is \\&quot;healing.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>this lotion feels very watery.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for softer hands, this probably won&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li>I have a friend that loves it so much</li>
            <li>None of them worked particularly well until I purchased Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream.  </li>
            <li>This hands absorb this quickly, do having a feeling of \\&quot;drinking\\&quot;, and it moisture my hands without leaving too much floral smell or any strange fragrance-free smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I have 28 year old hands again!!</li>
            <li>Here is the list of ingredients from the NEW version: Water, Glycerin, Distearyldimonium chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Steareth-21, Dimethicone, Dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Borago officinalis seed oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean)</li>
            <li>Working in a chemical laboratory I&#x27;m washing my hands frequently all day.  </li>
            <li>As a senior, the older I get, the drier my hands get, and since I use them a LOT throughout the day (cleaning, gardening, handling my animals, etc), I&#x27;m constantly washing them.  </li>
            <li>If you order this product, even though the name is the same, you will receive the new version.  </li>
            <li>Different formula from the new one.</li>
            <li>This does work as advertised - has really helped my dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Worked very well on husband&#x27;s cracked dry hands</li>
            <li>While this product has not been a permanent fix for the dried skin on my palms it has provided more relief than any of the other creams I used.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream if you have very dry hands.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I work in a Clinical Lab and I draw blood so I am continually washing my hands and taking gloves off and on before and after every patient and after handling specimens. If you were to guess my age from how my hands looked you might guess 80 (Maybe not quite that bad...but you get the idea). My hands were so dry that they started to crack and bleed. I did the Vaseline on my hands with socks covering them at night, it helped, but it&#x27;s such a hassle to do every night and I was getting it all over my sheets. I trusted the Vaseline brand, so I did some research and found this hand cream. My hands have improved immensely! I have 28 year old hands again!! :) Very Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> As a senior, the older I get, the drier my hands get, and since I use them a LOT throughout the day (cleaning, gardening, handling my animals, etc), I&#x27;m constantly washing them.  (I hate gloves.)  In the evenings, I crochet and the yarn often hangs up on the cracks on my fingers, which is VERY annoying.  I&#x27;ve tried many different hand creams, but none have been as good as this one.  It really is \\&quot;healing.\\&quot;  I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free!  The problem is, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  Only two stores within driving distance carry it and they&#x27;re often out.  Now I can order two 6-paks from Amazon.com (to save the shipping charge) and keep them handy in various places in the house - coffee table, desk, night table, kitchen, bathroom.  Thank you, Vaseline &amp; Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my wife and I have found this to be a better (and painless) &amp;#34;intimate lubricant&amp;#34; than any of the purpose-made products we tried.  We&#x27;ve been using it successfully and happily for several years.  Oh, and it also works well on hands.</li>
            <li> this lotion feels very watery. i also didn&#x27;t feel that it provided results that would warrant the name, &amp;#34;intensive rescue healing hand cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This does work as advertised - has really helped my dry, cracked hands. Easy size too - fits in the purse and the bag that goes out to the barn with me easily.</li>

            <li> it is one of the best products for dry hands and serious problems , use it and you will be happy</li>
            <li> I was doing some extensive backyard landscape work this caused blisters on my hands.  Yes I should have worn gloves.  Unfortunately, being a senior, my hands never recovered.  I have continual dry skin on the inside of my hands with cracking of the skin.  I tried many different products including prescription hand salve prescribed by my dermatologist.  None of them worked particularly well until I purchased Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream.  While this product has not been a permanent fix for the dried skin on my palms it has provided more relief than any of the other creams I used.  As long as I apply it daily, the skin looks and feels good which is about all that I can ask.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  Working in a chemical laboratory I&#x27;m washing my hands frequently all day.  I used to get cracks in my hands --- like spontaneous paper cuts --- all over my knuckles, cuticles, back of my hand, palms, and lips.  They would literally throb with pain. I tried lots of lotions and creams --- even wearing cotton goves over regular vasaline at night.  I went to a dermatologist.  Nothing worked &#x27;til this.  Put on a pool about the size of a nickle when going to bed and rub it in well.  Terrific stuff.  I just wish it came in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> Very good product for dry hands.  We have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Got these early, great value, great lotion...I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase. These are normally $3.49 per bottle and this contains 6!! Note - when I got them a couple were slightly opened, but may have happened during shipping. I just cleaned the ends and not much was wasted. But, it was still worth it and I was still happy.</li>
            <li> I got this elsewhere cuz I don&#x27;t really wanna buy in pack of 6 although I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot brands of hand cream, this is by far the best considering its effectiveness and its price. This hands absorb this quickly, do having a feeling of \\&quot;drinking\\&quot;, and it moisture my hands without leaving too much floral smell or any strange fragrance-free smell. Most importantly is that this won&#x27; get my hands oilly - I works on keyboards and mouses all the time, and I just hate to mess them with oilly fingerprints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for softer hands, this probably won&#x27;t help too much. But this is a good one by keep by your office desk, study room, or anywhere you&#x27;d wanna moisture your hands without all those messy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream if you have very dry hands. It is soothing and has worked the best of all the hand creams I have tried even the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> My son is taking medicine that dries out his skin.  I have left bottles of this hand cream all around the house and in the car and, so far, he has avoided cracked and painful hands.</li>
            <li> Great Deal! Thank you.</li>
            <li> excellent product and great price. Product shipped very quickly.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I have moderately dry skin due to my Rheumatoid Arthritis.  Mostly in the winter my hands get very dry and sometimes the skin will actually crack.  When I use this just twice a day, it stops that, and I have no problems.  It has no greasy feeling and soaks into your skin quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> This lotion&#x27;s name can be deceiving but once you try it your skin soaks up the lotion wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than greasy after use, your hands feel like silk or satin. It&#x27;s a great feeling. I have a friend that loves it so much, she puts it on her face.</li>
            <li> I have many kinds of hand cream, this is among my favorites. It is smooth, greaseless, goes into my skin, and I have it in every room. Terrific!</li>
            <li> All these items are very good and I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> The original, Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream, had the ingredients that I&#x27;ve listed below in it. If you order this product, even though the name is the same, you will receive the new version.  The new version, Vaseline intensive CARE advanced repair hand cream, is the new, &#x27;reformulated&#x27; version of Vaseline Intensive RESCUE Healing Hand Cream.  I think it&#x27;s not nearly as good or as effective as the original version. And the advertising is misleading. Here is the list of ingredients from the NEW version: Water, Glycerin, Distearyldimonium chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Steareth-21, Dimethicone, Dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Borago officinalis seed oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Petrolatum, Tocopherol Acetate, Lecithin, Tapioca Starch, Stearyl Stearate, Sodium Chloride, Isopropyl Myristate, Cedrol, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.  Although some of the ingredients are the same, the packaging and the original title here lead you to believe you are getting the original formula.  You are not. There are definite differences.  I&#x27;m now applying Urea and Dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride to my skin, where I wasn&#x27;t applying them to my skin with the original version. This is the list of the ORIGINAL formula ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Steareth 21, Dimethicone, Petrolatum, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Tapioca Starch, Stearic Acid, Glycine Soja Sterol (Soybean), Lecithin, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Stearyl Stearate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Ethylene Brassylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide. Different formula from the new one. False advertising. The original was just better.</li>
