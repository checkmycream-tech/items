            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can use it as a hair gel just like their aloe gel too, but I don&#x27;t require hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; very promptdelivery.</li>
            <li>I also love that this product does not contain alcohol which dries out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband is allergic to many shampoos and gels, detergents...and so on.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Used this item when it was available at the store and liked it</li>
            <li>I love Vit E gel, but I&#x27;ve since learn there are lot of chemicals in the ingredients that I don&#x27;t want to rub into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Our most preferred after sun rub-on.  </li>
            <li>I use this over lotion and aloe most of the time.</li>

            <li>My two children are extremely light and burn so easily.</li>

            <li>Great price for such a generous amount of gel.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years until it was no longer available for purchase in this area.</li>
            <li>Great product for those who are not concerned about such things.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t available in any stores I looked in so</li>
            <li>I like that as a gel it gets absorbed more quickly and dries more quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Originally bought it at a vitamin store, then couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>Very Light on the skin and works very well.</li>
            <li>Both arms are full of marks, looks like blood under the skin.</li>
            <li>It is cool when applied to the skin like aloe but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your skin shine either.</li>
            <li>It just glides on and I even mix it with my body cream because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Especially in the summertime, I found this product great for my skin; very soothing and beneficial to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Heck I&#x27;m willing to try it out during sex too!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Gel to anyone with oily or acne prone skin!!!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Fruit Earth vitamin e gel made my skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this brand because they use natural ingredients and of course Vitamin E helps repair the skin.  </li>
            <li>Relieves any dryness n adds a fresh glow to my face.</li>
            <li>Everyone was left with a nice tan and no peeling.</li>
            <li>Worth ordering and using.</li>
            <li>63 years old and not that many wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the after shave cool down and it really does help heal.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft and fresh looking without any fine lines...</li>
            <li>Have used the product and it does perform as stated: a nice non-sticky solution and aids in combatting dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The cap on this particular bottle, however, didn&#x27;t seem to work very well; I had to remove it to access product easily.</li>
            <li>It is quick absorbing</li>
            <li>I really like it very much !</li>
            <li>Non greasy and very nourishing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my scars on my face.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future I think!</li>
            <li>I have three dogs Shid Tzu they are in show coat and can get hot spots.  </li>
            <li>I had bought a small bottle some years ago and found that it is wonderful for the cracks in my fingers and dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Hubby absolutely loves this stuff but don&#x27;t tell him I told you.  </li>
            <li>This product was reasonably priced and ordered two 12 oz.</li>
            <li>Product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My tattoo artist actually recommends the Fruit of the Earth vitamin e and cocoa butter lotion available for around $2.50 at the dollar store just up the road.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It really does as advertized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>really dislike the medicinal smell</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s dry it leaves skin smooth and silky and very well conditioned.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I had initially ordered two bottles, but I&#x27;m going back and getting more for stock up.</li>
            <li>Last year I was able to buy this locally for under $5.</li>
            <li>if I could have found this in my local drug store  (as I was able in earlier days)</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it since local stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I use it at night just before bedtime; a moderate amount is plenty, and it seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this vitamin e gel too highly.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and has really helped with any breakage I was experiencing.</li>
            <li>I selected this product because my favorite dry hands Vitamin-E gel (from Banana Boat) is apparently no longer made.  </li>
            <li>I normally ONLY use this gel during the winter/fall season when my skin dries out in certain areas and starts flaking, I try to stay away from using this get during the day since my face is a little more oily and sweaty as opposed to at night.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is the exact gel, but this looks familiar &amp; I recommend for sunburns, specifically--plus, if it did THAT for my burn...</li>
            <li>I had to get used to the slight smell it has to it, but that goes away QUICK!</li>
            <li>I like it because it is not greasy and sinks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Between $2-$5 for a large bottle or tub of various vitamin e oils, creams, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I&#x27;m now unable to find in our local stores.  </li>
            <li>but it just sinks right in and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Love using this on minor scrapes and just general everyday use.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize, and when it dried, it kind of dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a sticky feeling behind, as long as you give it a chance to dry, and it moisturizes very nicely.</li>
            <li>The gel in the bottle did everything that the stuff that I&#x27;ve paid considerably more for (except of course that the more expensive stuff had far glitzier packaging, but that&#x27;s all) and smelled nicer (at least to me) too.</li>
            <li>But the Vitamin E gel is next to impossible to find in stores, therefore I was glad to see it available online.  </li>
            <li>I have a normal skin and after applying this product for 2 weeks, i find that my skin has become dry.</li>
            <li>in Summer I use aloe without Vitamin E because the E oil can be slightly too oily in hot weather).</li>
            <li>Obviously none of you have been to Dollar General.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and it was not oily or heavy on my face.</li>

            <li> Both arms are full of marks, looks like blood under the skin.</li>
            <li> It is cool when applied to the skin like aloe but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your skin shine either.</li>
            <li> It just glides on and I even mix it with my body cream because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Especially in the summertime, I found this product great for my skin; very soothing and beneficial to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Heck I&#x27;m willing to try it out during sex too!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Gel to anyone with oily or acne prone skin!!!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Fruit Earth vitamin e gel made my skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this brand because they use natural ingredients and of course Vitamin E helps repair the skin.  </li>
            <li> Relieves any dryness n adds a fresh glow to my face.</li>
            <li> Everyone was left with a nice tan and no peeling.</li>
            <li> Worth ordering and using.</li>
            <li> 63 years old and not that many wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the after shave cool down and it really does help heal.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft and fresh looking without any fine lines...</li>
            <li> Have used the product and it does perform as stated: a nice non-sticky solution and aids in combatting dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The cap on this particular bottle, however, didn&#x27;t seem to work very well; I had to remove it to access product easily.</li>
            <li> It is quick absorbing</li>
            <li> I really like it very much !</li>
            <li> Non greasy and very nourishing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future I think!</li>
            <li> I have three dogs Shid Tzu they are in show coat and can get hot spots.  </li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle some years ago and found that it is wonderful for the cracks in my fingers and dry skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Hubby absolutely loves this stuff but don&#x27;t tell him I told you.  </li>
            <li> This product was reasonably priced and ordered two 12 oz.</li>
            <li> Product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist actually recommends the Fruit of the Earth vitamin e and cocoa butter lotion available for around $2.50 at the dollar store just up the road.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It really does as advertized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> really dislike the medicinal smell</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dry it leaves skin smooth and silky and very well conditioned.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had initially ordered two bottles, but I&#x27;m going back and getting more for stock up.</li>
            <li> Last year I was able to buy this locally for under $5.</li>
            <li> if I could have found this in my local drug store  (as I was able in earlier days)</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it since local stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I use it at night just before bedtime; a moderate amount is plenty, and it seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this vitamin e gel too highly.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and has really helped with any breakage I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because my favorite dry hands Vitamin-E gel (from Banana Boat) is apparently no longer made.  </li>
            <li> I normally ONLY use this gel during the winter/fall season when my skin dries out in certain areas and starts flaking, I try to stay away from using this get during the day since my face is a little more oily and sweaty as opposed to at night.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the exact gel, but this looks familiar &amp; I recommend for sunburns, specifically--plus, if it did THAT for my burn...</li>
            <li> I had to get used to the slight smell it has to it, but that goes away QUICK!</li>
            <li> I like it because it is not greasy and sinks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Between $2-$5 for a large bottle or tub of various vitamin e oils, creams, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I&#x27;m now unable to find in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> but it just sinks right in and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Love using this on minor scrapes and just general everyday use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize, and when it dried, it kind of dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a sticky feeling behind, as long as you give it a chance to dry, and it moisturizes very nicely.</li>
            <li> The gel in the bottle did everything that the stuff that I&#x27;ve paid considerably more for (except of course that the more expensive stuff had far glitzier packaging, but that&#x27;s all) and smelled nicer (at least to me) too.</li>
            <li> But the Vitamin E gel is next to impossible to find in stores, therefore I was glad to see it available online.  </li>
            <li> I have a normal skin and after applying this product for 2 weeks, i find that my skin has become dry.</li>
            <li> in Summer I use aloe without Vitamin E because the E oil can be slightly too oily in hot weather).</li>
            <li> Obviously none of you have been to Dollar General.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and it was not oily or heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I would have bought it there, because in found the price a little high.  </li>
            <li> If they get very burned I apply this once they have bathed about four times a day until the red is gone and I re-apply still for at least several days after.</li>
            <li> It actually does HEAL dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells a little herbal perfumey when first applied but the smell fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So, for a long time I looked in every store imaginable and could NOT find this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I hope this company stays around for a long time and I can keep purchasing it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Helps prevent dry skin by adding moisture.</li>
            <li> it is reliable for all sorts of issues, sunburn, itches, dry skin, face and body lotion.  </li>
            <li> this was tried on my face, nail cuticles, dry skin, and</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a friend to use for sunburns and dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> We also use it for dry skin in the winter and burns.</li>
            <li> Not my dry spots on my face at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a different yet with this on my scars, but my skin is SO SOFT - and the gel does not leave that icky residue feeling that lotion or creams often do.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted me a very long time too!</li>
            <li> Very limited ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin e gel for years, and it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I could not find any other product like this.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to dry though, so keep that in mind-</li>
            <li> No oversmell-which is great-and the dark spots on my knees are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Down here in the South they&#x27;re everywhere and carry this brand exclusively in every one I&#x27;ve been in.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m barely half way done with it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a sealer after I wash my face with black soap</li>
            <li> I had been buying vitamin e gel from different places around town, and for some reason it became hard to get, all the stores didn&#x27;t carry it anymore!</li>
            <li> Even if you need extra moisture in your delicate feminine parts, this does the job!  </li>
            <li> It also feels a little tacky while it&#x27;s drying</li>
            <li> and then I seal it with a little bit of vitamin e oil.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it cut a step in the lotion I make and is less expensive than what&#x27;s I used before.  </li>
            <li> IMO it was a waste of $10.</li>
            <li> I received a burn a few months ago and this is helping in the healing process a lot.  </li>
            <li> It helps my dryness for a few hours.</li>
            <li> it worked well for what i needed but the smell was not particularly great, but is a must if you cant stand dry hair.</li>
            <li> The price is very high on Amazon--which is too bad.  </li>
            <li> bottles with a small shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face instead of a moisturizer every day after showering (at least in Fall thru Spring...</li>
            <li> I hated that feeling so much because I work on a computer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you what this was hard stuff to find!</li>
            <li> But they are really not that bad because I started using this as soon as the showed up</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, during the summer, winter, cold, you name it!!!  </li>
            <li> i brought this product after reading the reviews but i am not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> my eyes wre burning like a crazy whenever I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to say anything bad.</li>
            <li> I have had this annoying rash forever</li>
            <li> lots of crap in this gel.</li>
            <li> I HATE putting creams on my face and this always feels like its tightening your skin a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and the base is Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> My ex-husband was so horribly burned he had blisters and was sick.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but there was blemish around my worst buring part.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a Vitamin E gel when I got home with a TERRIBLE sunburn on my eyelids from the tanning bed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my eyes wre burning like a crazy whenever I put it on my face. There was no break out because of that but there was blemish around my worst buring part.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I really like this stuff, it&#x27;s a great product for pretty much any kind of skin problem I&#x27;ve had, it even works nicely for my beard!</li>
            <li> Love this product wish I could find it in the stores.  I&#x27;m so thankful that I can get it from Amazon.com  Great service.</li>
            <li> Cannot find this in retail stores around my home anymore.  Hubby absolutely loves this stuff but don&#x27;t tell him I told you.  It&#x27;s great for the after shave cool down and it really does help heal.  We use it for all sorts of fixes - rose thorn skin tears, pucker brushes on the shins, etc.  We even put it on the pets when they have an open scrape.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was told to after my skin grafts.  I now use it on EVERYTHING!  I&#x27;d eat it if it could sustain me.  It makes marks from blemishes go away faster, replaces facial toner, heals wounds faster, softens skin, moisturizes under your eyes and tones.  I just can&#x27;t go wrong!  I&#x27;m sure I can use it as a hair gel just like their aloe gel too, but I don&#x27;t require hair gel.  Even if you need extra moisture in your delicate feminine parts, this does the job!  Heck I&#x27;m willing to try it out during sex too!  I love this product. It would be nice if they sold it in stores by me, but they don&#x27;t.  Grab all that you can!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all over my body. I even use it in my hair. It makes my hair feel so soft and has really helped with any breakage I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> I had been buying vitamin e gel from different places around town, and for some reason it became hard to get, all the stores didn&#x27;t carry it anymore! I happened upon this brand on Amazon, and the reviews is what made me go ahead and give it a try. I am SO HAPPY I did! I LOVE this stuff! It is waaaayyy better than the brands I had been using and what I can&#x27;t get over is that it is NOT sticky or gooey, goes on like a dream and dries likity split! My skin feels so good! I use it all over and even as a moisturizer. I had to get used to the slight smell it has to it, but that goes away QUICK! I had initially ordered two bottles, but I&#x27;m going back and getting more for stock up. I hope this company stays around for a long time and I can keep purchasing it through Amazon! Also forgot to mention, it is ALCOHOL FREE!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 weeks now.No oversmell-which is great-and the dark spots on my knees are almost gone.Stretchmarks are fading away almost overnight.I will definitely be buying again-maybe even hoarding!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; very promptdelivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of years now. It seems to have a very good effect when it comes to healing the skin and making it look better. Works wonderfully as a shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Could not find Vitamin E Gel in stores.  This product was reasonably priced and ordered two 12 oz. bottles with a small shipping charge.  Have used the product and it does perform as stated: a nice non-sticky solution and aids in combatting dry skin.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Gel to anyone with oily or acne prone skin!!!  I have very oily skin, during the summer, winter, cold, you name it!!!  I normally ONLY use this gel during the winter/fall season when my skin dries out in certain areas and starts flaking, I try to stay away from using this get during the day since my face is a little more oily and sweaty as opposed to at night.  I love this brand because they use natural ingredients and of course Vitamin E helps repair the skin.  I also love that this product does not contain alcohol which dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product states that it is non-oily, it definitely does not feel greasy while applying.  BUT it always seems to leave my skin a bit shiny which is the reason that I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Aloe Vera Gel during the day and apply Vitamin E Gel at night.</li>
            <li> Regular use after daily showers does wonders for the skin. Helps prevent dry skin by adding moisture. It&#x27;s very good to apply on a sun burn.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied customer! Product worked better than I expected. It actually does HEAL dry skin. I have psoriasis and have never found a product that heals like this does. I will continue to buy this product and have told many friends how great it is for every part of the body. Too many uses to mention!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Great for a face and body moisturizer and awesome as a hair gell. Moisturizes the scalp as well.  I love this product.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer.  So it&#x27;s great to able to order it from these guys.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I&#x27;m now unable to find in our local stores.  The price is very high on Amazon--which is too bad.  Last year I was able to buy this locally for under $5.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for quite a while for a Vit E moisturizer that was not in an oil form and does not have Alcohol in it. This is it. I used it for the first time this morning and it was not oily or heavy on my face. My make-up went on with noe hassels.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin E gel for over 20 years.  Drug stores no longer carry this product, so I&#x27;m thankful to find it here.</li>
            <li> The gel in the bottle did everything that the stuff that I&#x27;ve paid considerably more for (except of course that the more expensive stuff had far glitzier packaging, but that&#x27;s all) and smelled nicer (at least to me) too. I can&#x27;t recommend this vitamin e gel too highly. Worth it at three times the price, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had this annoying rash forever and this stuff did the job. It is great for cooling off a sunburn also.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product after swimming and it seems to be doing the trick of cooling my skin after swimming in our sun drenched pool.</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell of this Aloe, I use it for shaving and it works great. If I don&#x27;t have any lotion I use this as well.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a Vitamin E gel when I got home with a TERRIBLE sunburn on my eyelids from the tanning bed (I no longer damage my skin btw) ...but I put this stuff on, and I swear--I am not exaggerating-- it was like magic...not an hour later the damage was GONE. HEALED. So, for a long time I looked in every store imaginable and could NOT find this stuff. After a while I FORGOT about it...or just haven&#x27;t thought about finding online...UNTIL TODAY. I am not sure if this is the exact gel, but this looks familiar &amp; I recommend for sunburns, specifically--plus, if it did THAT for my burn...it has to be great for your skin&#x27;s daily damage and just improving your skin.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this on my newest strechmarks and theyve been diminishing! Im so happy!</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to many shampoos and gels, detergents...and so on. He uses this as a hair gel and it works great and does not give him hives or any discomfort. All of the Fruit of the Earth products are great! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. I like that as a gel it gets absorbed more quickly and dries more quickly. I do find I still have to wash my hands after applying. Great price for such a generous amount of gel.</li>
            <li> It smells a little herbal perfumey when first applied but the smell fades after a few minutes. It also feels a little tacky while it&#x27;s drying but once it&#x27;s dry it leaves skin smooth and silky and very well conditioned. It&#x27;s a great substitute for body lotion after a shower during the summer months.</li>
            <li> Obviously none of you have been to Dollar General. Down here in the South they&#x27;re everywhere and carry this brand exclusively in every one I&#x27;ve been in. Between $2-$5 for a large bottle or tub of various vitamin e oils, creams, lotions, etc. My tattoo artist actually recommends the Fruit of the Earth vitamin e and cocoa butter lotion available for around $2.50 at the dollar store just up the road.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t discount the discount stores, people! :p</li>
            <li> if I could have found this in my local drug store  (as I was able in earlier days) I would have bought it there, because in found the price a little high.  How ever since it is supply and demand I paid where I found the supply.  The product itself has been used in my household for some time.  it is reliable for all sorts of issues, sunburn, itches, dry skin, face and body lotion.  I like it because it is not greasy and sinks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I needed some kind of gel/lotion to help heal some scars. I haven&#x27;t noticed a different yet with this on my scars, but my skin is SO SOFT - and the gel does not leave that icky residue feeling that lotion or creams often do. I hated that feeling so much because I work on a computer so I&#x27;d get it on my keys and never get it off.</li>
            <li> Fruit Earth vitamin e gel made my skin feel very smooth and soft. It cleared up my&lt;br /&gt;acne really good. I would recommend this product to any of my friends with oily&lt;br /&gt;acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Love using this on minor scrapes and just general everyday use. Non greasy and very nourishing! I could not find any other product like this. Very limited ingredients. No fillers and NO alcohol!</li>
            <li> Seems to help with dry/irritated skin and prefer it to same brand&#x27;s aloe vera gel.  But the Vitamin E gel is next to impossible to find in stores, therefore I was glad to see it available online.  The cap on this particular bottle, however, didn&#x27;t seem to work very well; I had to remove it to access product easily.</li>
            <li> love it. great for travel</li>
            <li> Great as a moisturizer for skin and hair. this is a good quality product. Double duty needed for this winter season.</li>
            <li> I order a case of this stuff every spring, and use it throughout the summer. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it since local stores stopped carrying it. Excellent for sunburn!</li>
            <li> This product is great for getting rid of arm spots whether caused by bumping and bruising and medicines like blood thinners. Both arms are full of marks, looks like blood under the skin. Plus when i bump into a door frame or something another bruise is there. A Romanian friend tod me to use vitamin E liquid and rub it on the bruises and arms. I can tell you that after a couple applications i can see a lot of areas fading already. Good product, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I have used it for years until it was no longer available for purchase in this area. It is great for use on scars and stretch marks. It is non greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep the skin rejunavating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a best moisturizing cream to keep the skin from damaging in extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li> this was tried on my face, nail cuticles, dry skin, and well, let&#x27;s just say i finally gave up and it is now by the kitchen sink.  Maybe I will remember and use on my hands after I wash dishes.  IMO it was a waste of $10.</li>
            <li> This product helped out with my scars. Now i am using it to moisturize my skin.  I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> should have read the ingredients. lots of crap in this gel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for face n body. Relieves any dryness n adds a fresh glow to my face. Very clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help soothe my skin and repair the sun damage to it. It helped my skin to not only heal but to actually tan from the burn! It is quick absorbing and well I like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel and look great with out that greasy feel and look.</li>
            <li> i brought this product after reading the reviews but i am not happy with the results. I have a normal skin and after applying this product for 2 weeks, i find that my skin has become dry. It doesn&#x27;t make me glow or anything closer.</li>
            <li> Used this item when it was available at the store and liked it but it is no longer carried at retail stores and decided to buy it again, it always did a good job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores.  I use it for all my skin needs.</li>
            <li> Very Light on the skin and works very well.</li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my scars on my face. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This bottle is amazing. It really does as advertized. It does not leave a sticky feeling behind, as long as you give it a chance to dry, and it moisturizes very nicely. This bottle has lasted me a very long time too!</li>
            <li> I love Vit E gel, but I&#x27;ve since learn there are lot of chemicals in the ingredients that I don&#x27;t want to rub into my skin.  Great product for those who are not concerned about such things.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on my face instead of a moisturizer every day after showering (at least in Fall thru Spring... in Summer I use aloe without Vitamin E because the E oil can be slightly too oily in hot weather). This gel also works incredibly well for healing sunburns. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wow, it cut a step in the lotion I make and is less expensive than what&#x27;s I used before.  So I do say, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin e gel for years, and it is getting harder to find.  This stuff is great for your skin</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a friend to use for sunburns and dry skin etc. I&#x27;ll tell you what this was hard stuff to find! It wasn&#x27;t available in any stores I looked in so when I found it on here I snagged it. It&#x27;s lasted a long time and I&#x27;m barely half way done with it. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another one when it runs out it&#x27;s great for keeping your skin healthy and helping speed up sunburn healing.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted! It smells good too. why do I need to have all these words to fill spaces....</li>
            <li> Our most preferred after sun rub-on.  We also use it for dry skin in the winter and burns. Seller was very good to deal with.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize, and when it dried, it kind of dried my skin out.  I bought it to reduce the scar tissue from a recent surgery...didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  I received a burn a few months ago and this is helping in the healing process a lot.  It has a thousand uses too.</li>
            <li> it worked well for what i needed but the smell was not particularly great, but is a must if you cant stand dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this over lotion and aloe most of the time. It is cool when applied to the skin like aloe but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your skin shine either.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because my favorite dry hands Vitamin-E gel (from Banana Boat) is apparently no longer made.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results from this gel from Fruit of Earth.  I use it at night just before bedtime; a moderate amount is plenty, and it seems to absorb quickly.  It&#x27;s just what I needed!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. It is not greasy or smelly. It just glides on and I even mix it with my body cream because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Great for after sun care. Absorbs nicely into skin</li>
            <li> Especially in the summertime, I found this product great for my skin; very soothing and beneficial to my skin.  Very good</li>
            <li> I wish I had stock in this product! It is what I have used for years now for sunburns. My two children are extremely light and burn so easily. If they get very burned I apply this once they have bathed about four times a day until the red is gone and I re-apply still for at least several days after. They DO NOT PEEL EVER once using this enough. My ex-husband was so horribly burned he had blisters and was sick. I applied this to the burned portions repeatedly, even after the red was gone for about a week. He never peeled. The only spots that did crust up were where the blisters were. Everyone was left with a nice tan and no peeling. This stuff is amazing and I tell everyone to order this by the case like I do every summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the vitamin E gel for several years now. I used to buy it at CVS but they stop selling it.  It made my skin so soft and fresh looking without any fine lines... I use this as a sealer after I wash my face with black soap, I put on the vitamin e gel and then I seal it with a little bit of vitamin e oil.  Now my face is radient, youthful, healthy and fresh looking!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great non-greasy natural product that soaks in and helps your skin heal. I love the cool, refreshing gel.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much ! it&#x27;s very good and useful! I will buy more in the future I think!</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Ticked that I never rec&#x27;d it or a reason why. I really wanted to try it and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good reviews on this so I don&#x27;t want to say anything bad. I don&#x27;t see my skin change. It helps my dryness for a few hours. Not my dry spots on my face at all.</li>
            <li> Smells funky, but is great for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I really dislike the medicinal smell but it just sinks right in and moisturizes my skin. It takes a little while to dry though, so keep that in mind- you&#x27;ll look shiny for a bit before it soaks up.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle some years ago and found that it is wonderful for the cracks in my fingers and dry skin on my hands. I search locally in Victoria Australia to find it and couldn&#x27;t so I imported it from America and I recommend it to everyone. Ironically after I received the 12 oz bottle I found the smaller bottles at a Chemist in Kyabram but the colour is quite different, a lot paler. There is a Fruits Of The Earth Shop in Echuca but they don&#x27;t sell this gel unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy to keep away stretch marks. It worked great! Then at about 8 months I stopped using it out of laziness and BAM stretch marks. I kick myself. But they are really not that bad because I started using this as soon as the showed up and after I gave birth.</li>
            <li> Worth ordering and using.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second review. I&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 10 years now. 63 years old and not that many wrinkles. I HATE putting creams on my face and this always feels like its tightening your skin a bit. I love that. Yeah, keep it away from your eyes, it will sting them. It is cheap and lasts a very long time. I use it daily and one bottle lasts about 6 months. Originally bought it at a vitamin store, then couldn&#x27;t find it. Thank goodness for the internet!</li>
            <li> Great for skin just wish they didn&#x27;t use alcohol so much. Helps the skin but leaves it with a sticky feeling .</li>
            <li> I have three dogs Shid Tzu they are in show coat and can get hot spots.  This stops them from itching and ruining their coats without being greasy or me worrying about them licking it off their coats.</li>
            <li> This is actually the truth. This is what my Doctor ordered for me to use. Vitamin E. The nice thing is, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and is wonderful  for sunburn. It&#x27;s not sticky and the base is Aloe Vera. Any skin irratations or dry skin, this is the perfect thing to use!</li>
