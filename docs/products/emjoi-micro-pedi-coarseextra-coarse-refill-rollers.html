            <li> It works so well that you have to use it outside or over a sink because you get what looks like a pile of snow of dry skin.  </li>

            <li> The blue roll is for extra tough calloused skin.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t always get the tougher skin off that you can get with a little elbow grease using a manual</li>
            <li> He works outside all year around and his hands get very thick callus on them.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead, callused skin came off my feet.  </li>
            <li> No more splitting, no more pain.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the refills were not so expensive, so plan to have her try the sand paper route as suggested in comments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i mean the machine ...</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I only got one use from it.</li>
            <li> I recomend this to anyone that has painful, dry and cracked heals.</li>
            <li> The magenta for not so tough</li>

            <li> It works so well that you have to use it outside or over a sink because you get what looks like a pile of snow of dry skin.  Don&#x27;t try to do it all at once, it may take a week or two of using every other day before reaching the desired result.</li>
            <li> love it it actually works great product I highly recommend it even though the cartridge refill&#x27;s are a tad pricey</li>
            <li> I have never see a gadget work as well as this does.  I have never had smooth and soft feel.  Well now I do</li>
            <li> i thought it works faster ._.&lt;br /&gt;is there anything that could make it any more faster?&lt;br /&gt;i mean the machine ...</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is faster than using a pumice stone.  My spouse had used it before and wanted a new one to replace the old one. She has recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The blue roll is for extra tough calloused skin. The magenta for not so tough skin.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions recommend that if two people are using Micropedi they should not&lt;br /&gt;use the same colored roll. Also if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation do&lt;br /&gt;not use. Other than that it really works....</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of using this product and will not use manual foot files again. I can tell the difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective grooming product.  It does the job in minutes which allows me to save on pedicures!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SOOOOOOO GREAT I BOUGHT 2 OF THEM JUST TO MAKE SURE I ALWAYS HAVE ONE.I AM DIABETIC SO TAKING GOOD CARE OF YOUR FEET IS VERY IMPORTANT. WITH SUMMER COMING I LIKE TO HAVE NICE SMOOTH FEET AND HEELS FOR SANDALS AND AT THE POOL. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised.  Both my wife and I used it and were very pleased with it.  It looks like it will last.</li>
            <li> The best pedicure product you can find. It really get rid of the most stubborn callus I have had. Also introduced to 3 other ladies, they absolutely loved it. You gotta give it a try! No need to shop at QVC (where I first heard about it) Amazon gives a lot better deal with free shipping and handling!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent and effortless product for removal of dry skin.  I use it regularly. and wish I had known about it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because I just received it today and I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead, callused skin came off my feet.  I&#x27;ve seen these on QVC, which I usually think their prices are really good, but it was cheaper at Amazon.  Had I not seen demonstrations on QVC, I would not of bought this, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, the only thing I see wrong is that it has its own rechargeable battery, but everything else is an excellent product. recommend</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a male friend.  He works outside all year around and his hands get very thick callus on them.  Sometimes the skin splits and bleeds no matter how hard he works to keep them free of thickening.  He tried this on his hands and was amazed at how quickly he was able to smooth them.  No more splitting, no more pain.  A great gift for a guy who works very hard with his hands!</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea and it worked the first time.  When I turned it on for the second use it wouldn&#x27;t turn the roller.  I put new batteries in but no luck. I put in a new roller... again no luck.  The gears are plastic so maybe it stripped?  Disappointed that I only got one use from it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, when buying this item, but it is the best thing for dry and cracked feet. It leaves your feet soft and smooth. I recomend this to anyone that has painful, dry and cracked heals. It is absolutely the best. Make sure to also get the unisex tough calluses remover. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is much better than using the old fashioned file, it seems gentler on the feet since you don&#x27;t have to scrub.
