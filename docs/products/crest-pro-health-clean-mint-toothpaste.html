    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I have never had this issue before and have excellent dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>It claims to fight plaque and gingivitis, so I thought this would be the perfect</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>best thing I can say about this toothpaste is that it probably leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great gum report from dentist and no cavities!!!</li>
            <li>It would be in their best interest to do so.</li>
            <li>I am honestly impressed by the quality of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist was really impressed</li>
            <li>, this Crest Pro-Health is excellent.</li>
            <li>I just stumbled upon these reviews and I am SO happy I did!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>INCREDIBLE</li>
            <li>, fight and win cavities and gum issues, you get what I am saying?</li>
            <li>This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Stannus flouride is supposed to be really great for your teeth, but I just cannot use this product.  </li>
            <li>We agreed that perhaps it was the combination of all my efforts regarding the front teeth that produced the response I experienced.</li>
            <li>The dentist said he used to give it out in the office, but about 20% of patients experienced problems after using it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 2 years and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great all around toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great price if you sign up for subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>Happy with this toothpaste, no ill-effects at all.</li>
            <li>ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>The best toothpase out there for people who love cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I was almost put off by the comments about it turning teeth brown, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasant to use and does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had beautiful teeth, fresh breath, and excellent hygiene.</li>
            <li>2 Stars for (great boxing, by the way, reeled me in like an innocent flounder!)</li>
            <li>I bought Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste based on a good experience using my sister&#x27;s toothpaste when we were visiting our parents.</li>
            <li>In fact, it doesn&#x27;t taste good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was good to discover I was not alone with my misgivings.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was good.  </li>
            <li>has proven to be a good one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It tasted good...</li>
            <li>and I prefer the version with Scope Outlast, but it is a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li>But, it feels noticeably good when the brush head is rotating around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works and tastes good.</li>
            <li>This flavor is nice, it has a pleasant minty flavor that is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Just as many others have shared, I too experienced the issues w/ skin shedding or sloughing off the inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It however isn&#x27;t my favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to be able to have a conversion with someone and worry that my breath will offend them!</li>
            <li>Crest pro health toothpaste tells me it has ActivClean crystals, which translates into crunchy toothpaste, not the most pleasant way to start the morning.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste and have had a great experience using the product since it debuted.    </li>
            <li>I did though, and fortunately haven&#x27;t experienced any of the side effects mentioned here.</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste twice because I liked the taste</li>
            <li>Yes, it has kind of a grainy texture, but I think that is one of reasons why it cleans my teeth so well.</li>
            <li>I have used Crest whitening with Scope and had no issue; I liked it in fact.  </li>
            <li>I should have read reviews before buying but like many others I bought this on sale and wanted to see if it was as good as the ads on TV say it is.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t help but think of some horror movie where I&#x27;ve been poisoned and my teeth are falling out.</li>
            <li>While the product really has wonderful toothe cleansing and whitening result</li>
            <li>However, the quality of the Crest products remains intact as it was still effective against tooth plaque build-up.</li>
            <li>I liked this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier mint taste than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest, but quite nice.  </li>
            <li>If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  </li>
            <li>I have found Crest toothpaste to be both effective and pleasant-tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my own and started with bleeding of my gums.  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought I had like five canker sores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s authentic, good price, sealed containers, and not expired dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Taste great and leaves your teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The gel toothpaste has a strong taste which I didn&#x27;t find refreshing or pleasant.</li>
            <li>this is concerning and fascinating to me as i have used crest pro health, clean mint, for YEARS.</li>
            <li>We are moving on to better and more satisfying options, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>I experienced this for a day or two when I first started using the product.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my teeth and gums, while still cleaning beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is super abrasive!!  </li>
            <li>I hope someone at Procter and Gamble does some tests to find out why many people (including myself) are having an allergic reaction to this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste, I love the \\&quot;grit\\&quot;, I love the mouth feel.</li>
            <li>With that said, most people won&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li>I did a search online and found many consumer complaints against this product.  </li>
            <li>i am considering switching to another brand until i know more.</li>
            <li>one thing i do know is the fewer chemicals we put in our bodies the better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was at work when this happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem safe and I have stopped using this product altogether.</li>
            <li>AM EXPERIENCING MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS</li>
            <li>PERHAPS THEY HAVE MORE RESISTANCE THAN I DO.</li>
            <li>need I say more on that.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping my throat is better in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I even threw out many lipsticks, etc.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to continue to sell a product that you know is SHREDDING people from the inside out?</li>
            <li>While researching the symptoms, I ran across many discussion threads on</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how many people suffered from this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the toothpaste itself, but unless you make sure the cap is all the way on, (which my boyfriend never does)</li>
            <li>A tooth paste should not have so many side-effects.</li>
            <li>My husband was reluctant to change brands, but after a tube of the Crest Pro Health, he asked me to buy more not knowing there was another tube under the sink.</li>
            <li>But because Pro Health is working better for my husband, we&#x27;ve switched over.</li>
            <li>but I think it feels better.</li>
            <li>wife dislikes it because it burns her gums as most people reported.  </li>
            <li>It tasted ok, and it cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The minty flavor is okay.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Pro-Health formula might taste OK to others, but it doesn&#x27;t suit me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; This one seems OK, perfectly acceptable taste and texture, though I will be watching out for potential staining.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and</li>
            <li>I have noticed my lips were much more chapped than before.</li>
            <li>Then, as the days progressed, I started developing more and more ulcers.</li>
            <li>However, I keep using it because my 6-month check ups have never been better.</li>
            <li>It is more of a gel than a paste, which is something you should keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like gel toothpaste.</li>
            <li>really glad I looked the reviews up.</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste - it&#x27;s the one that always leaves our mouth the freshest for the longest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worthwhile to note that I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;* a reputable toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I am sure and</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and the convenience of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>however... many Americans can&#x27;t afford dental care for issues like cavities, let alone blithely run off to get stains removed from their teeth.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product, I had always trusted the Crest name and assumed this product would hold up to previously experienced quality standards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still the best prescription for good oral hygiene requires a lot more than just toothpaste and brushing at least once a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth is in excellent health as long as I don&#x27;t use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I think the flavor is pretty good</li>
            <li>did she know she was sentencing me to two more weeks of incredible pain, and open sores.  </li>
            <li>The cinnamon is more paste-like and softer and is even more of a problem this way than the cool mint which has a more gel-like consistency.  </li>
            <li>I get a strong craving for a sweet drink sometime after brushing with this toothpaste, and that isn&#x27;t at all the kind of thing I should be thinking about after brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as a whitening treatment, but will certainly help that.    </li>
            <li>The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel, a bit more like a gel than the \\&quot;Invigorating Clean Mint\\&quot;, which is my favorite of these Crest Clinical toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced an issue with the toothpaste, but I haven&#x27;t yet emptied the tube though I have used it for a sustained period of time.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never been in such good condition as with pro health toothpaste!</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel clean and smooth for hours afterwards!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is too strong.</li>
            <li>But, I seem to have found a response to another problem-sufferer, and the emailed reply indicates it IS an affect of the product being so strong that it tears at the lining of the mouth.</li>
            <li>The reason is that I listened to my hygenist and they were strong advoates for it.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the \\&quot;Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride\\&quot; in it is just too strong for me or maybe it is the \\&quot;Sodium</li>
            <li>Best of all, it helps with my sensitivity - something I have developed as I grow older.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste has a nice mild flavor that the whole family liked.</li>
            <li>The flavor is fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>*just fine</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I, like many others have experienced the peeling of my mouth, extremely dry lips, bumps on my lip, sore mouth, etc.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look white and strong and the scent is attractive.  </li>
            <li>Why does it need a huge cap that doesn&#x27;t even seal the hole where the toothpaste comes out?</li>
            <li>This may be great toothpaste for some people, but my suggestion is to buy a different product!</li>
            <li>since  I sound so aggravated and displeased by it?  </li>
            <li>This is the simulacrum of &#x27;democracy&#x27; touted by advocates of unregulated \\&quot;free</li>
            <li>I had it rarely before but more recurrent when I started using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I tried it again another day and experienced the same scenario.  </li>
            <li>The spot was smooth, like my taste buds were gone.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>They have received complaints of sore gums and molars as a result of using stannous flouride filled toothpastes - which the Pro-Health has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received it for free to try</li>
            <li>I have always had healthy gums and teeth and have always taken pride in my smile and the health of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Well, the toothpaste was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack 8</li>
            <li>Oz]]for night time brushes and am going two years cavity free.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh flavor that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>And I notice that my mouth feels cleaner longer after using it than with the cheap Colgate that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>It is good for those with sensitive teeth, and it also has whitening properties.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a strong, a bit sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We won&#x27;t be buying more of this because the many 1-Star reviews seem to indicate that there is a quality control problem with this particular product.</li>
            <li>My requirements for toothpaste aren&#x27;t that tough: doesn&#x27;t brush away enamel, leaves me feeling clean, tastes good, safe and good value.</li>
            <li>so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is nothing unique about this product.</li>
            <li>I doubt it makes a significant difference in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rinse for a good 1-2+ minutes after I finish brushing and brush over my teeth with a wet toothbrush again just to make sure most of the toothpaste is gone and rinse some more to make sure the left over is not sitting around my gums.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 7.8-Ounce</li>
            <li>In the neutral category I&#x27;d put taste and the feeling of a clean mouth immediately afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a paste that leaves my mouth feeling clean for hours after.  </li>
            <li>I have always been meticulous when it came to keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>I love ordering our toiletries from Amazon and this is one that I order most frequently.</li>
            <li>So this product may be less than ideal if your dental hygiene is less than ideal, but I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health Clinical Gum Protection Clean Mint Toothpaste, 4-Ounce</li>
            <li>My mouth does have a palpably clean feeling after using it, and that is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been great for me and does not exacerbate dry mouth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I saw the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste, it seemed a no-brainer to upgrade to this newest Crest formula.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean without any residue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; is supposed to refer to, because it&#x27;s not the taste.</li>
            <li>I will not be using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 3 minutes with the brush on, my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Probably very effective, but the texture is grainy and the taste is very strong and not appealing.</li>
            <li>My dentist prescribed a special fluoride toothpaste that has helped some, but it discolors my teeth.</li>
            <li>All in all just toothpaste, nothing really special about it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The box continues on to tell me that Crest is specially formulated to prevent staining but if it does go see my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right?!</li>
            <li>He was right!  </li>
            <li>The only good effect of this product is that it does seem to whiten my teeth a bit compared to toothpastes without whitening agents.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true-</li>
            <li>Both times I used it, my cheeks and gums appeared to lighten up by many shades while I simultaneously felt a drying, chemical-y sensation to my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Recently, I took a good look at the inside of my mouth and</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health uses stannous flouride, which is a superior dental agent but which was replaced in mass market toothpastes by sodium flouride because the latter had a longer shelf life and lowered manufacturing costs.  </li>
            <li>I am in good health, so it is nothealth related.</li>
            <li>For me, it is a good basic toothpaste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li>I will never love this toothpaste until it tastes as pleasant and clean as the gel toothpastes I know and love.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I remain loyal to the brand, but will no longer be using this line.</li>
            <li>She was able to remove the stains, the wear spots haven&#x27;t breached the enamel (I made be able to rebuild it with proper care)</li>
            <li>I began to look for things in my diet that might be causing the lining of my mouth to slough and was about to stop drinking my favorite tea when an Internet search helped me determine that it was my new toothpaste that was causing the problem.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to pin  point what was causing my lips to peel and to become very sensitive to lipsticks and glosses that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don&#x27;t need or want large</li>
            <li>It definitely is caused by the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and it&#x27;s amazing the FDA allows products like this to be sold in the U.S.    </li>
            <li>I remained calm</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So, I brushed and flossed more often and switched to Crest Pro-Health alcohol free mouthwash also.  </li>
            <li>This tastes fresh and minty.</li>
            <li>Worth it?</li>
            <li>that many other people have experienced the same thing.  </li>
            <li>out of pure joy at the possibility of getting my mouth and life back to normal by throwing away my Pro Health, as well as out of frustration that Crest knows how this is affecting people</li>
            <li>Please Crest, do the right thing and recall this product immediately.  </li>
            <li>Until I see you stand up and do the right thing for your consumers, I will go out of my way to never purchase another Crest or Proctor and Gamble Product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t happen right away.</li>
            <li>began using it, and noticed a number of things right away.</li>
            <li>I am feeling a combination of relief and frustration right now.</li>
            <li>I want to cry right now...</li>
            <li>Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste - Minty Fresh Triple Pack 18.6 Oz]], which is pleasant enough that I look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like this newish package design; it is nice to be able to stand my toothpaste on the cap so it takes less room on the counter.</li>
            <li>The problem is that Crest has put marketing above delivering a suitable product.</li>
            <li>It feels like I took piping hot pizza fresh from the oven and rubbed it all over my lips and gums.</li>
            <li>Sensitivity protection is also adequate as such products go, but not as good as Crest&#x27;s specific Sensitivity toothpastes which, for my sensitive teeth, work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>Evidently it appealed to too reasonable - and thus too rare -  buyers simply wanting a non-corrosive toothpaste to clean their teeth, without any ridicuous representations akin to the ads even on these amazon.com pages showing gorgeous 20-year-old models with wide-open mouths full of cosmetically enhanced white teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been using various Crest products for many years and appreciated being offered a sample of the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest toothpaste, along with Sonicare toothbrushes, and the combination has left me with healthy teeth and gums into my \\&quot;golden years.\\</li>
            <li>The toothpaste does a good job of cleaning my teeth and does seem to be designed for sensitive teeth which my teeth definitely are.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Crest ProHealth since it first came on the market about 2 years ago(?)  </li>
            <li>However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.  </li>
            <li>That aside, this is one I will not be coming back to, as soon as it departs (fully consumed, cheap bastard that I am!)</li>
            <li>I did not at first associate this with the toothpaste, however, so I continued to use it.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I woke up one morning and realized the sores of that day were most prevalent in the areas of my mouth that the toothpaste most likely settled in when I brushed the night before.  </li>
            <li>and I thought maybe the first trial&#x27;s effects were by chance,</li>
            <li>Six months ago when I first used this product I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling.  </li>
            <li>, we owe so dang much to those in the million dollar plus income bracket!)</li>
            <li>I used CrestPro-Health (Clinical Gum Protection ) for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>Then my teeth hurt so much where my gums bled!</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know exactly what this material is.</li>
            <li>I first assumed it was just gooey residue from the toothpaste, congealing into a sort of stringy paste.</li>
            <li>, I brushed my teeth and felt as if I had just burned the inside of my top lip on a hot pizza.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t connect the burning with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>HAVING BEEN A REGULAR USER OF CREST FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my gag reflex kicked in...</li>
            <li>I came onto Amazon to read the reviews and was horrified to see how many people had a similar experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if there are others out there making the connections that I am.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is totally with as many complaints as I have read about this product why the FDA has not removed it from the market.  </li>
            <li>No doubt the makers of Crest Pro Health (Proctor &amp; Gamble) are fully aware of the adverse reactions consumers are experiencing w/ this product.</li>
            <li>at first I thought that maybe this toothpaste was removing bacteria</li>
            <li>Always make sure to read the back of the box of anything before you purchase.</li>
            <li>Burned my mouth its so &#x27;hot&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I asked if I should pick up more Sensodyne, and he said no, the Pro Health worked and was totally controlling his sensitivity.</li>
            <li>So I learned more about it, and I&#x27;m convinced that stannous fluoride is the future of toothpaste fluoride.</li>
            <li>sure that if this multibillion dollar global brand of toothpaste caused everyone&#x27;s mouth to rot away, the folks at P&amp;G would have soiled their pants and recalled it day one.</li>
            <li>merely not buy this product; avoid it.</li>
            <li>She had trouble removing the stains, especially near the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet and found many warnings about the staining problem, mostly with the mouthwash, but also from the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The mint is crisp without being overpowering or any yucky aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I immediately looked this up online and see that so many people are having the same experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one experiencing this.</li>
            <li>At first, I ignored it, and didn&#x27;t connect the two.</li>
            <li>I immediately switched to Tom&#x27;s toothpaste (which my dentist recommended &amp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!)</li>
            <li>I prefer the flavor of Crest&#x27;s white goop toothpastes better.</li>
            <li>The first thing I do not like is the taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were looking for it for a better price than the local supermarkets and pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>but sure enough, this pack of 4 was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>I felt a huge lump under my right ear, and the right side of my face was swollen, hot and red.</li>
            <li>because after a good thorough brushing, my teeth do not feel as silky smooth as when I use various other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I immediately had an intense burning sensation in the right side of my cheek.</li>
            <li>By the time I got to work, my mouth felt normal again, but people should definitely be aware of this bizarre side effect from using this particular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, one blurted out - with no apparent sense of irony - that she wanted to be sure to get the one version which would make her teeth the whitest.</li>
            <li>This paste has a mild flavor (\\&quot;clean cinnamon\\&quot;) and a gritty texture.  </li>
            <li>While the Gum Protection is fiercely minty, the Clean Mint is mild enough that my son doesn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste long term is Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity with Scope and Whitening.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because I drank too much soda that day.  </li>
            <li>It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly  (reminds me of the old Pop Rocks candy in miniature).  </li>
            <li>I continue to have a problem with dry mouth, but it seems to be getting better each day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They got me in quicker than I would&#x27;ve liked to see them typically, but this was a bit of an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; for me.  </li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I wish they still made it in a large tube like the 8.2 oz Pro.</li>
            <li>The same thing happened to me about a year ago after my dentist&#x27;s hygienist gave me a free trial tube of this junky toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know there was this whole problem with pro health toothpaste and people having sore lips and tissue sloughing.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned this, and it is real.  </li>
            <li>After reading all these reviews, Crest really should recall the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest (tone&#x3D;sarcasm).</li>
            <li>My entire family enjoy the taste of this toothpaste .</li>
            <li>I used Crest Pro Health for about a month and during this period My gums became very irritated.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice before searching the internet to see if I wasn&#x27;t the only person to experience bizarre problems with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It was so intense</li>
            <li>I started using Crest Pro-Health and didn&#x27;t really have any issues until about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed no problems - no slime, no staining - just a really clean-feeling mouth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>In the beginning it didn&#x27;t bother me all that much</li>
            <li>The color (pigment) of my lips changed dramatically, appearing much darker and almost blueish/vein-like.</li>
            <li>and this morning it is still very sore</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste very minty, either.</li>
            <li>and I got really worried.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight, I got ready for bed (15 minutes ago) and used the toothpaste</li>
            <li>I had to spit out the toothpaste because it stung so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this, I feel like the products cleans well, and appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t tingle overly much because I don&#x27;t need that sensation to feel toothpaste or mouthwash works.</li>
            <li>This has really been adversely affecting my life.</li>
            <li>I just need to be more careful.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with it.</li>
            <li>taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one that left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>One thing that I&#x27;ve seen most other reviewers complain about is skin sloughing.  </li>
            <li>Both dripped on my shirt more than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li>I actually find myself being more consistent with regular brushing when I have this stuff about.</li>
            <li>did a search on Stannous fluoride, it does strengthen the enamel better than other fluorides.</li>
            <li>It has sensitivity protection second only to Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity Original Formula, adequate whitening, no mouth irritation, minimal mouth slime, very fresh feeling and fresh breath, no bad taste in my mouth hours afterward, no dry mouth or taste impairment, and no drippiness.  </li>
            <li>like is in dire need of a Car Wash type washing, absolute revitalizing, let&#x27;s start brand new type of feeling!</li>
            <li>I figured the Pro-Health Clean Mint would be the same.  </li>
            <li>Toward the end of my usage, the sensation was so strong that my mouth felt dry even when I was swishing water around in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>looked up reviews like I&#x27;m writing right now and saw the exact same things that have been happening to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not pleasant or comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>A pleasant customer service representative heard my complaint and referred me to a health professional for the company.</li>
            <li>The month slime everyone talks about is gross yet so true.</li>
            <li>The irony in the proliferation of packageclaims is that, while the packages reveal a variety of chemical content, only an expert in toothpaste bio-chemistry can understand the true variation among these options.</li>
            <li>The whitening and plaque/tartar fighting claims are true of regular budget toothpaste, it&#x27;s just marketing doubletalk.</li>
            <li>Crest had better improve it in a hurry, or else the drawbacks of this product will wear me down.</li>
            <li>it really refreshens my breath and keeps the clean feeling for long.</li>
            <li>She also recommended I make sure I brushed my teeth twice daily.  </li>
            <li>(both sides of the inside of my lips where the brush always rubbed, the area where the gums met my cheeks on top and bottom and in the back of my mouth and throat)  That morning, it finally dawned on me it must be the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Her advice was to avoid any toothpaste with extra \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; and stick to the most basic formulas.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile most manufacturers of household products today do not care to hear the views of customers or to take into account what any member of their corporate board, for instance, would discover if he or she actually made a point of trying out the product to assess its quality.</li>
            <li>With in 10 ten minutes I had a large blister form in the right side of my cheek.</li>
            <li>Only mildly recommended.</li>
            <li>I asked why the Pro-Health in particular?  </li>
            <li>I was always a Colgate fan, however, two years ago I started trying out Crest&#x27;s Pro Health products (mainly because of a CVS promotion).</li>
            <li>&quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s Crest toothpaste, and so, decent toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you DO NOT USE this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trashing this product.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a clean feeling on my teeth all day long ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is some, but not all of what I experienced; loss of taste and smell (to some degree), white filmy slime all over the inside of my mouth that comes out in strings about ten minutes after brushing in the morning and at night, a metallic taste in my mouth, discoloring of my teeth, gums pulling away from teeth, sensitivity of my mouth, blisters on the roof of my mouth, a chalky white tongue that I could not get back to normal, even after brushing it.  </li>
            <li>I used at least a full large tube of both the clean mint and the cinnamon versions of this.  </li>
            <li>This is a little more gritty/industrial.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, too bad the price went thru the roof after first order</li>
            <li>AND...the packaging does not include a complete list of ingredients...is that legal?  </li>
            <li>I normally use another type of Crest, but Crest Pro-Health was on sale</li>
            <li>After you stop using it for a week, your mouth should return to normal.</li>
            <li>After about a week my mouth returned to normal</li>
            <li>More of this toothpaste gets wasted oozing out onto the counter, the packaging cannot seem to control the product oozing out into the drawer, onto the counter, etc.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using it and hope to get better in a few days.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste because the mint flavor has a strangely granular texture that I could&#x27;nt quite get used to when I brushed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling a lot cleaner and healthier than the normal crest and colgate.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than I don&#x27;t mind the flavor, and it leaves my mouth tasting and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>you can get past the flavor, this toothpaste really does clean well, but that flavor is such a huge turn-off for me that I won&#x27;t be able to use it long enough to determine the long-term effectiveness of this</li>
            <li>Several hours into my work day, I could not move my neck to the right side.</li>
            <li>This Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint is very much like the Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection except for a few of the chemical ingredients are re-ordered, and the flavor.  </li>
            <li>I then noticed a mild soreness in my throat and even in my nasal passages...which I thought was really strange.  </li>
            <li>Other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used leaves a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I never even considered that it could be my new toothpaste, which I used for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste looking for something new.</li>
            <li>Im getting new toothpaste tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth are still very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use this toothpaste with my Sonicare and feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning!  </li>
            <li>After my first use I noticed there was white, stringy, saliva in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>As with other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used over the last 10 years or more, I always brush my teeth with a Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>Customers of Crest are in one respect no more to the company than guinea pigs for marketing researchers, trying to see which package will bring in the most revenue.</li>
            <li>Also, my gums bled more while I brushed than with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I used the first tube, and bought a second.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and suddenly realized what I did.  </li>
            <li>If there is a class action - count me in!</li>
            <li>Sounds like class action lawsuit time to me!</li>
            <li>After the first time I used this product, within 15-20 minutes I noticed a slimy white film in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Bought this last night without being aware of its reputation and brushed with it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>The texture is pretty gritty</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ve tried other brands occasionally, but always returned to Crest as soon as the competing brand&#x27;s tube was finished.</li>
            <li>I started to notice my inner mouth felt funny afterwards, like the walls of my mouth sticking my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes pro-health different than other crest toothpastes, if it has an extra ingredient or a higher concentration of some ingredients, but I rather love it.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I thought it was related to me starting to drink tea but reading around, green tea is actually good for you (arguably) and does NOT stain teeth.  </li>
            <li>This may sound cleaning, but it strips way too much and leave your mouth almost raw in spots.</li>
            <li>For a few months, local stores had one gentle Crest alternative, a green-tea option in the \\&quot;expressions\\&quot; series; but this quickly ceased to be available either locally or online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my colgate total clean mint, thanks but no thanks crest.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like something like Armand-Hammer, which is more or less just baking soda.  </li>
            <li>but when my mouth and inside my lips  started becoming raw</li>
            <li>This toothpaste, more or less, agitates this, which may make your mouth appear worse before better.  </li>
            <li>Large lesions followed, and then swelling and hives on the outside of my lips.  </li>
            <li>There seem to be little gritty things (maybe baking soda) in it which helps serve as an abrasive to more thoroughly cle an my teeth.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product 4 days ago and am almost completely clear of the sores and lesions.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they changed but all of the sudden in the last few months I experienced the same white slimy coating on my teeth and inside my cheeks.</li>
            <li>After a while I started having a sore throat and developed two sores, one on my lip and one inside my cheek.  </li>
            <li>I discontinued use about a week ago and all of my symptoms are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>i am surprised and intrigued/concerned.</li>
            <li>I feel a lawsuit coming after so many people have complained</li>
            <li>I simply brush my gums and inside of my mouth gently or use a washcloth to wipe those cells away.  </li>
            <li>I attribute that partly to my gentle Colgate electric toothbrush and to this gritty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>market\\&quot; capitalism today as if it were the real substance underlying political democracy in America (for which, to protect, we are urged to vote Republican</li>
            <li>CREST Pro-Health, Sensitive plus Enamel shield was causing swelling of the lips and sloughing of the lining of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>all directly attributed to this toothpaste.    </li>
            <li>In fact, after I brush, I completely forget that it does that</li>
            <li>When I told him, he wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My gums became extremely sensitive and started to ache and burn.  </li>
            <li>I was completely gobsmacked.</li>
            <li>WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m 51 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I had a my professional dental cleaning and check-</li>
            <li>A week later after my dental cleaning, my lower teeth stained so fast as if I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth for a year.  </li>
            <li>But for about 4 months I started to notice staining near where the bone met the gum line.  </li>
            <li>I told my dentist that I had this metallic taste in my mouth and that my gums and teeth feel sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised.</li>
            <li>I can only say that, when I use this toothpaste, my teeth look very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see the glowing reviews this toothpaste is receiving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that the FDA hasn&#x27;t gotten involved in this.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is far too abrasive.</li>
            <li>I guess my mouth isn&#x27;t quite as sensitive as some others -</li>
            <li>This one comes with stannous fluoride, the one that can temporarily stain, but that is because this is for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dislike of this product is not because I do not have sensitive teeth, but rather</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive teeth, stannous fluoride toothpastes seem to be the norm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old posting from my mom&#x27;s Amazon account.</li>
            <li>Wow, I cant believe it.  </li>
            <li>So, off to find another toothpaste for sensitive teeth that doesn&#x27;t have stannous flouride in it.</li>
            <li>And this is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste is for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this Crest Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection today and upon my first use after rinsing out with water my mouth was noticeably somewhere between dry and foamy.</li>
            <li>I was ready to pitch this toothpaste in the trash and move back to my old Crest Tartar Control toothpaste, but I can&#x27;t discount the advantages of stannous fluoride (which is also, apparently, prevalent in mouthwashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off, my mouth seriously felt anesthetized for some time after use.</li>
            <li>It may slightly defeat the purpose of brushing, but I tend to have hot tea pretty regularly throughout the day and some toothpastes just seem to linger for an hour, even longer and then alter the taste of my tea.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that this particular time you have eaten, drank and smoked various products and your mouth feel</li>
            <li>My recent 6-month dental check-up was better than usual.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was a defective one, but I bought it in a 2-pack and the second tube was the same exact way.  </li>
            <li>I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening.</li>
            <li>After dental cleaning, teeth went 3 shades whiter and back to normal looking.</li>
            <li>To get the last of the toothpaste out, one has to press the tube together; you cannot roll it up like a normal tube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Afterward, my mouth was full of dead cheek/gum tissue.</li>
            <li>then drive off to get some gas before work, and by the time I arrive at the station 5 minutes from my apartment, my mouth is full of slimy, dead skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing would calm it down.  </li>
            <li>MY MOUTH WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOING BACK TO MY OLD TOOTHPASTE...</li>
            <li>I usually used Crest Clean Mint.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with sensitivity in my mouth, but this toothpaste is designed to help with sensitive teeth and gums as well as doing all the other things I brush my teeth for: whitening, killing germs, fighting plaque and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems to clean our teeth like the usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am dismayed that they continue to sell it as it causes such serious side effects for many people.</li>
            <li>and it appears that there are several more serious side effects reported, with skin peeling off the inside of your mouth</li>
            <li>The sores were on every bit of soft tissue inside my mouth; from my gums, to under my tongue, my cheeks, the back of my throat and the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Once as I watched as two college-aged young women shopping together for toothpaste perused the shelves of variously differentiated Crest packages,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching back to my old toothpaste in the morning.</li>
            <li>I could barely talk.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve discovered posts and discussion on this issue dating back to 2007.</li>
            <li>AS WELL AS I DEVELOPED RED BUMPS &amp; BURNING ON INSIDES OF MY LIPS...</li>
            <li>Switched back to Crest w baking soda my old friend.</li>
            <li>result was a complete 180 from her advice the last time I saw her.  </li>
            <li>We use this kind/brand and normally buy it at Costco; however, we needed &amp;#34;cart filler&amp;#34; and bought this (and subsequently put it in a white elephant gift exchange...)</li>
            <li>First off, it isn&#x27;t as pasty as your typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether I have unique anti-fiberglass chemicals in my mouth, or if I&#x27;m immune to all pain, but I actually like this toothpaste quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Unlike other sensitivity toothpastes, this one actually doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel funny</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t drink much coffee, tea or other drinks like that, so I can&#x27;t speak to the stain-fighting power.  </li>
            <li>but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like hydrogen peroxide in mouthwash, some people have significant negative reactions to Stannous Fluoride.  </li>
            <li>The paste cannot be easily cleaned away - and if you attempt to do so using sustained hot water, the tube&#x27;s contents will permanently transform into a fluid which slowly and continually oozes over your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I not only found that this was not a good sensitive mouth toothpaste, but it actually made my teeth feel more sensitive!</li>
            <li>Then my gums became bright red and irritated, my tongue was swollen and numb and the inside of my cheek was inflamed, swollen and irratated.</li>
            <li>It feels heavier than regular toothpaste, and it oozes slightly out of the tube, like I need to keep the top upright</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste and, much like the other critical reviews here, it burnt my mouth out.</li>
            <li>They even developed some minor bleeding issues again.  </li>
            <li>I did notice was that a day after I switched to it, my sensitive teeth were no longer sensitive - this after months of no results from &amp;#34;sensitive-tooth&amp;#34; toothpastes containing the active ingredient potassium nitrate (like Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way, there were many other negative reviews on Amazon concerning this effect caused by Pro Health toothpaste, but they have all been mysteriously removed.</li>
            <li>To be \\&quot;modern?\\&quot; Modern people don&#x27;t like the idea of giant plastic things which served no useful purpose in the first place sitting in landfills for the next few thousand years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been my favorite toothpaste for a long time, i go out of my way to find it, and i&#x27;ve NEVER experienced issues like this.</li>
            <li>After reading other Amazon reviews about this product, I realized it was the toothpaste and stopped using it and now my mouth is free of clumps of dead skin!</li>
            <li>Then you are better off trying something else other than this dull, uneventful toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Even as I write that last paragraph, I&#x27;m now aware of a stinging, raw feeling on the inside of my left cheek, presumably from where the last piece of stringy white stuff came....    </li>
            <li>Also, this had that absorbing characteristic of other Crest Pro-Health products that I have tried, and I find its lasting sensation unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Its wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I have never had this issue before and have excellent dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> It claims to fight plaque and gingivitis, so I thought this would be the perfect</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> best thing I can say about this toothpaste is that it probably leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great gum report from dentist and no cavities!!!</li>
            <li> It would be in their best interest to do so.</li>
            <li> I am honestly impressed by the quality of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist was really impressed</li>

            <li> I just stumbled upon these reviews and I am SO happy I did!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLE</li>
            <li> , fight and win cavities and gum issues, you get what I am saying?</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Stannus flouride is supposed to be really great for your teeth, but I just cannot use this product.  </li>
            <li> We agreed that perhaps it was the combination of all my efforts regarding the front teeth that produced the response I experienced.</li>
            <li> The dentist said he used to give it out in the office, but about 20% of patients experienced problems after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 years and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great all around toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great price if you sign up for subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> Happy with this toothpaste, no ill-effects at all.</li>
            <li> ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> The best toothpase out there for people who love cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I was almost put off by the comments about it turning teeth brown, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasant to use and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had beautiful teeth, fresh breath, and excellent hygiene.</li>
            <li> 2 Stars for (great boxing, by the way, reeled me in like an innocent flounder!)</li>
            <li> I bought Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste based on a good experience using my sister&#x27;s toothpaste when we were visiting our parents.</li>
            <li> In fact, it doesn&#x27;t taste good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was good to discover I was not alone with my misgivings.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was good.  </li>
            <li> has proven to be a good one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It tasted good...</li>
            <li> and I prefer the version with Scope Outlast, but it is a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> But, it feels noticeably good when the brush head is rotating around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works and tastes good.</li>
            <li> This flavor is nice, it has a pleasant minty flavor that is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Just as many others have shared, I too experienced the issues w/ skin shedding or sloughing off the inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It however isn&#x27;t my favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to be able to have a conversion with someone and worry that my breath will offend them!</li>
            <li> Crest pro health toothpaste tells me it has ActivClean crystals, which translates into crunchy toothpaste, not the most pleasant way to start the morning.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste and have had a great experience using the product since it debuted.    </li>
            <li> I did though, and fortunately haven&#x27;t experienced any of the side effects mentioned here.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste twice because I liked the taste</li>
            <li> Yes, it has kind of a grainy texture, but I think that is one of reasons why it cleans my teeth so well.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest whitening with Scope and had no issue; I liked it in fact.  </li>
            <li> I should have read reviews before buying but like many others I bought this on sale and wanted to see if it was as good as the ads on TV say it is.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t help but think of some horror movie where I&#x27;ve been poisoned and my teeth are falling out.</li>
            <li> While the product really has wonderful toothe cleansing and whitening result</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the Crest products remains intact as it was still effective against tooth plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> I liked this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier mint taste than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest, but quite nice.  </li>
            <li> If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  </li>
            <li> I have found Crest toothpaste to be both effective and pleasant-tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my own and started with bleeding of my gums.  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought I had like five canker sores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s authentic, good price, sealed containers, and not expired dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Taste great and leaves your teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The gel toothpaste has a strong taste which I didn&#x27;t find refreshing or pleasant.</li>
            <li> this is concerning and fascinating to me as i have used crest pro health, clean mint, for YEARS.</li>
            <li> We are moving on to better and more satisfying options, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I experienced this for a day or two when I first started using the product.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my teeth and gums, while still cleaning beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is super abrasive!!  </li>
            <li> I hope someone at Procter and Gamble does some tests to find out why many people (including myself) are having an allergic reaction to this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste, I love the \\&quot;grit\\&quot;, I love the mouth feel.</li>
            <li> With that said, most people won&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li> I did a search online and found many consumer complaints against this product.  </li>
            <li> i am considering switching to another brand until i know more.</li>
            <li> one thing i do know is the fewer chemicals we put in our bodies the better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was at work when this happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem safe and I have stopped using this product altogether.</li>
            <li> AM EXPERIENCING MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS</li>
            <li> PERHAPS THEY HAVE MORE RESISTANCE THAN I DO.</li>
            <li> need I say more on that.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping my throat is better in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I even threw out many lipsticks, etc.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to continue to sell a product that you know is SHREDDING people from the inside out?</li>
            <li> While researching the symptoms, I ran across many discussion threads on</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how many people suffered from this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the toothpaste itself, but unless you make sure the cap is all the way on, (which my boyfriend never does)</li>
            <li> A tooth paste should not have so many side-effects.</li>
            <li> My husband was reluctant to change brands, but after a tube of the Crest Pro Health, he asked me to buy more not knowing there was another tube under the sink.</li>
            <li> But because Pro Health is working better for my husband, we&#x27;ve switched over.</li>
            <li> but I think it feels better.</li>
            <li> wife dislikes it because it burns her gums as most people reported.  </li>
            <li> It tasted ok, and it cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The minty flavor is okay.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Pro-Health formula might taste OK to others, but it doesn&#x27;t suit me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; This one seems OK, perfectly acceptable taste and texture, though I will be watching out for potential staining.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and</li>
            <li> I have noticed my lips were much more chapped than before.</li>
            <li> Then, as the days progressed, I started developing more and more ulcers.</li>
            <li> However, I keep using it because my 6-month check ups have never been better.</li>
            <li> It is more of a gel than a paste, which is something you should keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like gel toothpaste.</li>
            <li> really glad I looked the reviews up.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste - it&#x27;s the one that always leaves our mouth the freshest for the longest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worthwhile to note that I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;* a reputable toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I am sure and</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and the convenience of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> however... many Americans can&#x27;t afford dental care for issues like cavities, let alone blithely run off to get stains removed from their teeth.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product, I had always trusted the Crest name and assumed this product would hold up to previously experienced quality standards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still the best prescription for good oral hygiene requires a lot more than just toothpaste and brushing at least once a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth is in excellent health as long as I don&#x27;t use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think the flavor is pretty good</li>
            <li> did she know she was sentencing me to two more weeks of incredible pain, and open sores.  </li>
            <li> The cinnamon is more paste-like and softer and is even more of a problem this way than the cool mint which has a more gel-like consistency.  </li>
            <li> I get a strong craving for a sweet drink sometime after brushing with this toothpaste, and that isn&#x27;t at all the kind of thing I should be thinking about after brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as good as a whitening treatment, but will certainly help that.    </li>
            <li> The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel, a bit more like a gel than the \\&quot;Invigorating Clean Mint\\&quot;, which is my favorite of these Crest Clinical toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced an issue with the toothpaste, but I haven&#x27;t yet emptied the tube though I have used it for a sustained period of time.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never been in such good condition as with pro health toothpaste!</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel clean and smooth for hours afterwards!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is too strong.</li>
            <li> But, I seem to have found a response to another problem-sufferer, and the emailed reply indicates it IS an affect of the product being so strong that it tears at the lining of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The reason is that I listened to my hygenist and they were strong advoates for it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the \\&quot;Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride\\&quot; in it is just too strong for me or maybe it is the \\&quot;Sodium</li>
            <li> Best of all, it helps with my sensitivity - something I have developed as I grow older.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste has a nice mild flavor that the whole family liked.</li>
            <li> The flavor is fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> *just fine</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I, like many others have experienced the peeling of my mouth, extremely dry lips, bumps on my lip, sore mouth, etc.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look white and strong and the scent is attractive.  </li>
            <li> Why does it need a huge cap that doesn&#x27;t even seal the hole where the toothpaste comes out?</li>
            <li> This may be great toothpaste for some people, but my suggestion is to buy a different product!</li>
            <li> since  I sound so aggravated and displeased by it?  </li>
            <li> This is the simulacrum of &#x27;democracy&#x27; touted by advocates of unregulated \\&quot;free</li>
            <li> I had it rarely before but more recurrent when I started using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I tried it again another day and experienced the same scenario.  </li>
            <li> The spot was smooth, like my taste buds were gone.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> They have received complaints of sore gums and molars as a result of using stannous flouride filled toothpastes - which the Pro-Health has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it for free to try</li>
            <li> I have always had healthy gums and teeth and have always taken pride in my smile and the health of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Well, the toothpaste was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack 8</li>
            <li> Oz]]for night time brushes and am going two years cavity free.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh flavor that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> And I notice that my mouth feels cleaner longer after using it than with the cheap Colgate that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> It is good for those with sensitive teeth, and it also has whitening properties.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a strong, a bit sweet flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We won&#x27;t be buying more of this because the many 1-Star reviews seem to indicate that there is a quality control problem with this particular product.</li>
            <li> My requirements for toothpaste aren&#x27;t that tough: doesn&#x27;t brush away enamel, leaves me feeling clean, tastes good, safe and good value.</li>
            <li> so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing unique about this product.</li>
            <li> I doubt it makes a significant difference in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rinse for a good 1-2+ minutes after I finish brushing and brush over my teeth with a wet toothbrush again just to make sure most of the toothpaste is gone and rinse some more to make sure the left over is not sitting around my gums.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 7.8-Ounce</li>
            <li> In the neutral category I&#x27;d put taste and the feeling of a clean mouth immediately afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a paste that leaves my mouth feeling clean for hours after.  </li>
            <li> I have always been meticulous when it came to keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> I love ordering our toiletries from Amazon and this is one that I order most frequently.</li>
            <li> So this product may be less than ideal if your dental hygiene is less than ideal, but I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Clinical Gum Protection Clean Mint Toothpaste, 4-Ounce</li>
            <li> My mouth does have a palpably clean feeling after using it, and that is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been great for me and does not exacerbate dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I saw the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste, it seemed a no-brainer to upgrade to this newest Crest formula.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean without any residue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; is supposed to refer to, because it&#x27;s not the taste.</li>
            <li> I will not be using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 3 minutes with the brush on, my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> Probably very effective, but the texture is grainy and the taste is very strong and not appealing.</li>
            <li> My dentist prescribed a special fluoride toothpaste that has helped some, but it discolors my teeth.</li>
            <li> All in all just toothpaste, nothing really special about it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; The box continues on to tell me that Crest is specially formulated to prevent staining but if it does go see my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right?!</li>
            <li> He was right!  </li>
            <li> The only good effect of this product is that it does seem to whiten my teeth a bit compared to toothpastes without whitening agents.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true-</li>
            <li> Both times I used it, my cheeks and gums appeared to lighten up by many shades while I simultaneously felt a drying, chemical-y sensation to my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Recently, I took a good look at the inside of my mouth and</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health uses stannous flouride, which is a superior dental agent but which was replaced in mass market toothpastes by sodium flouride because the latter had a longer shelf life and lowered manufacturing costs.  </li>
            <li> I am in good health, so it is nothealth related.</li>
            <li> For me, it is a good basic toothpaste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all</li>
            <li> I will never love this toothpaste until it tastes as pleasant and clean as the gel toothpastes I know and love.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I remain loyal to the brand, but will no longer be using this line.</li>
            <li> She was able to remove the stains, the wear spots haven&#x27;t breached the enamel (I made be able to rebuild it with proper care)</li>
            <li> I began to look for things in my diet that might be causing the lining of my mouth to slough and was about to stop drinking my favorite tea when an Internet search helped me determine that it was my new toothpaste that was causing the problem.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to pin  point what was causing my lips to peel and to become very sensitive to lipsticks and glosses that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don&#x27;t need or want large</li>
            <li> It definitely is caused by the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and it&#x27;s amazing the FDA allows products like this to be sold in the U.S.    </li>
            <li> I remained calm</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So, I brushed and flossed more often and switched to Crest Pro-Health alcohol free mouthwash also.  </li>
            <li> This tastes fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> Worth it?</li>
            <li> that many other people have experienced the same thing.  </li>
            <li> out of pure joy at the possibility of getting my mouth and life back to normal by throwing away my Pro Health, as well as out of frustration that Crest knows how this is affecting people</li>
            <li> Please Crest, do the right thing and recall this product immediately.  </li>
            <li> Until I see you stand up and do the right thing for your consumers, I will go out of my way to never purchase another Crest or Proctor and Gamble Product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t happen right away.</li>
            <li> began using it, and noticed a number of things right away.</li>
            <li> I am feeling a combination of relief and frustration right now.</li>
            <li> I want to cry right now...</li>
            <li> Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste - Minty Fresh Triple Pack 18.6 Oz]], which is pleasant enough that I look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this newish package design; it is nice to be able to stand my toothpaste on the cap so it takes less room on the counter.</li>
            <li> The problem is that Crest has put marketing above delivering a suitable product.</li>
            <li> It feels like I took piping hot pizza fresh from the oven and rubbed it all over my lips and gums.</li>
            <li> Sensitivity protection is also adequate as such products go, but not as good as Crest&#x27;s specific Sensitivity toothpastes which, for my sensitive teeth, work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> Evidently it appealed to too reasonable - and thus too rare -  buyers simply wanting a non-corrosive toothpaste to clean their teeth, without any ridicuous representations akin to the ads even on these amazon.com pages showing gorgeous 20-year-old models with wide-open mouths full of cosmetically enhanced white teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using various Crest products for many years and appreciated being offered a sample of the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest toothpaste, along with Sonicare toothbrushes, and the combination has left me with healthy teeth and gums into my \\&quot;golden years.\\</li>
            <li> The toothpaste does a good job of cleaning my teeth and does seem to be designed for sensitive teeth which my teeth definitely are.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Crest ProHealth since it first came on the market about 2 years ago(?)  </li>
            <li> However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.  </li>
            <li> That aside, this is one I will not be coming back to, as soon as it departs (fully consumed, cheap bastard that I am!)</li>
            <li> I did not at first associate this with the toothpaste, however, so I continued to use it.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I woke up one morning and realized the sores of that day were most prevalent in the areas of my mouth that the toothpaste most likely settled in when I brushed the night before.  </li>
            <li> and I thought maybe the first trial&#x27;s effects were by chance,</li>
            <li> Six months ago when I first used this product I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling.  </li>
            <li> , we owe so dang much to those in the million dollar plus income bracket!)</li>
            <li> I used CrestPro-Health (Clinical Gum Protection ) for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> Then my teeth hurt so much where my gums bled!</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know exactly what this material is.</li>
            <li> I first assumed it was just gooey residue from the toothpaste, congealing into a sort of stringy paste.</li>
            <li> , I brushed my teeth and felt as if I had just burned the inside of my top lip on a hot pizza.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t connect the burning with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> HAVING BEEN A REGULAR USER OF CREST FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my gag reflex kicked in...</li>
            <li> I came onto Amazon to read the reviews and was horrified to see how many people had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested to hear if there are others out there making the connections that I am.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is totally with as many complaints as I have read about this product why the FDA has not removed it from the market.  </li>
            <li> No doubt the makers of Crest Pro Health (Proctor &amp; Gamble) are fully aware of the adverse reactions consumers are experiencing w/ this product.</li>
            <li> at first I thought that maybe this toothpaste was removing bacteria</li>
            <li> Always make sure to read the back of the box of anything before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Burned my mouth its so &#x27;hot&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I asked if I should pick up more Sensodyne, and he said no, the Pro Health worked and was totally controlling his sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So I learned more about it, and I&#x27;m convinced that stannous fluoride is the future of toothpaste fluoride.</li>
            <li> sure that if this multibillion dollar global brand of toothpaste caused everyone&#x27;s mouth to rot away, the folks at P&amp;G would have soiled their pants and recalled it day one.</li>
            <li> merely not buy this product; avoid it.</li>
            <li> She had trouble removing the stains, especially near the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet and found many warnings about the staining problem, mostly with the mouthwash, but also from the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The mint is crisp without being overpowering or any yucky aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I immediately looked this up online and see that so many people are having the same experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one experiencing this.</li>
            <li> At first, I ignored it, and didn&#x27;t connect the two.</li>
            <li> I immediately switched to Tom&#x27;s toothpaste (which my dentist recommended &amp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!)</li>
            <li> I prefer the flavor of Crest&#x27;s white goop toothpastes better.</li>
            <li> The first thing I do not like is the taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were looking for it for a better price than the local supermarkets and pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> but sure enough, this pack of 4 was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> I felt a huge lump under my right ear, and the right side of my face was swollen, hot and red.</li>
            <li> because after a good thorough brushing, my teeth do not feel as silky smooth as when I use various other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I immediately had an intense burning sensation in the right side of my cheek.</li>
            <li> By the time I got to work, my mouth felt normal again, but people should definitely be aware of this bizarre side effect from using this particular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , one blurted out - with no apparent sense of irony - that she wanted to be sure to get the one version which would make her teeth the whitest.</li>
            <li> This paste has a mild flavor (\\&quot;clean cinnamon\\&quot;) and a gritty texture.  </li>
            <li> While the Gum Protection is fiercely minty, the Clean Mint is mild enough that my son doesn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste long term is Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity with Scope and Whitening.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was because I drank too much soda that day.  </li>
            <li> It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly  (reminds me of the old Pop Rocks candy in miniature).  </li>
            <li> I continue to have a problem with dry mouth, but it seems to be getting better each day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They got me in quicker than I would&#x27;ve liked to see them typically, but this was a bit of an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; for me.  </li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I wish they still made it in a large tube like the 8.2 oz Pro.</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to me about a year ago after my dentist&#x27;s hygienist gave me a free trial tube of this junky toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know there was this whole problem with pro health toothpaste and people having sore lips and tissue sloughing.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned this, and it is real.  </li>
            <li> After reading all these reviews, Crest really should recall the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest (tone&#x3D;sarcasm).</li>
            <li> My entire family enjoy the taste of this toothpaste .</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health for about a month and during this period My gums became very irritated.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice before searching the internet to see if I wasn&#x27;t the only person to experience bizarre problems with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It was so intense</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro-Health and didn&#x27;t really have any issues until about 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no problems - no slime, no staining - just a really clean-feeling mouth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> In the beginning it didn&#x27;t bother me all that much</li>
            <li> The color (pigment) of my lips changed dramatically, appearing much darker and almost blueish/vein-like.</li>
            <li> and this morning it is still very sore</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste very minty, either.</li>
            <li> and I got really worried.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight, I got ready for bed (15 minutes ago) and used the toothpaste</li>
            <li> I had to spit out the toothpaste because it stung so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this, I feel like the products cleans well, and appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t tingle overly much because I don&#x27;t need that sensation to feel toothpaste or mouthwash works.</li>
            <li> This has really been adversely affecting my life.</li>
            <li> I just need to be more careful.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with it.</li>
            <li> taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one that left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> One thing that I&#x27;ve seen most other reviewers complain about is skin sloughing.  </li>
            <li> Both dripped on my shirt more than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> I actually find myself being more consistent with regular brushing when I have this stuff about.</li>
            <li> did a search on Stannous fluoride, it does strengthen the enamel better than other fluorides.</li>
            <li> It has sensitivity protection second only to Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity Original Formula, adequate whitening, no mouth irritation, minimal mouth slime, very fresh feeling and fresh breath, no bad taste in my mouth hours afterward, no dry mouth or taste impairment, and no drippiness.  </li>
            <li> like is in dire need of a Car Wash type washing, absolute revitalizing, let&#x27;s start brand new type of feeling!</li>
            <li> I figured the Pro-Health Clean Mint would be the same.  </li>
            <li> Toward the end of my usage, the sensation was so strong that my mouth felt dry even when I was swishing water around in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> looked up reviews like I&#x27;m writing right now and saw the exact same things that have been happening to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not pleasant or comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> A pleasant customer service representative heard my complaint and referred me to a health professional for the company.</li>
            <li> The month slime everyone talks about is gross yet so true.</li>
            <li> The irony in the proliferation of packageclaims is that, while the packages reveal a variety of chemical content, only an expert in toothpaste bio-chemistry can understand the true variation among these options.</li>
            <li> The whitening and plaque/tartar fighting claims are true of regular budget toothpaste, it&#x27;s just marketing doubletalk.</li>
            <li> Crest had better improve it in a hurry, or else the drawbacks of this product will wear me down.</li>
            <li> it really refreshens my breath and keeps the clean feeling for long.</li>
            <li> She also recommended I make sure I brushed my teeth twice daily.  </li>
            <li> (both sides of the inside of my lips where the brush always rubbed, the area where the gums met my cheeks on top and bottom and in the back of my mouth and throat)  That morning, it finally dawned on me it must be the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Her advice was to avoid any toothpaste with extra \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; and stick to the most basic formulas.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile most manufacturers of household products today do not care to hear the views of customers or to take into account what any member of their corporate board, for instance, would discover if he or she actually made a point of trying out the product to assess its quality.</li>
            <li> With in 10 ten minutes I had a large blister form in the right side of my cheek.</li>
            <li> Only mildly recommended.</li>
            <li> I asked why the Pro-Health in particular?  </li>
            <li> I was always a Colgate fan, however, two years ago I started trying out Crest&#x27;s Pro Health products (mainly because of a CVS promotion).</li>
            <li> &quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s Crest toothpaste, and so, decent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you DO NOT USE this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trashing this product.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a clean feeling on my teeth all day long ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is some, but not all of what I experienced; loss of taste and smell (to some degree), white filmy slime all over the inside of my mouth that comes out in strings about ten minutes after brushing in the morning and at night, a metallic taste in my mouth, discoloring of my teeth, gums pulling away from teeth, sensitivity of my mouth, blisters on the roof of my mouth, a chalky white tongue that I could not get back to normal, even after brushing it.  </li>
            <li> I used at least a full large tube of both the clean mint and the cinnamon versions of this.  </li>
            <li> This is a little more gritty/industrial.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, too bad the price went thru the roof after first order</li>
            <li> AND...the packaging does not include a complete list of ingredients...is that legal?  </li>
            <li> I normally use another type of Crest, but Crest Pro-Health was on sale</li>
            <li> After you stop using it for a week, your mouth should return to normal.</li>
            <li> After about a week my mouth returned to normal</li>
            <li> More of this toothpaste gets wasted oozing out onto the counter, the packaging cannot seem to control the product oozing out into the drawer, onto the counter, etc.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it and hope to get better in a few days.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste because the mint flavor has a strangely granular texture that I could&#x27;nt quite get used to when I brushed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling a lot cleaner and healthier than the normal crest and colgate.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than I don&#x27;t mind the flavor, and it leaves my mouth tasting and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> you can get past the flavor, this toothpaste really does clean well, but that flavor is such a huge turn-off for me that I won&#x27;t be able to use it long enough to determine the long-term effectiveness of this</li>
            <li> Several hours into my work day, I could not move my neck to the right side.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint is very much like the Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection except for a few of the chemical ingredients are re-ordered, and the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I then noticed a mild soreness in my throat and even in my nasal passages...which I thought was really strange.  </li>
            <li> Other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used leaves a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I never even considered that it could be my new toothpaste, which I used for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste looking for something new.</li>
            <li> Im getting new toothpaste tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth are still very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste with my Sonicare and feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning!  </li>
            <li> After my first use I noticed there was white, stringy, saliva in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> As with other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used over the last 10 years or more, I always brush my teeth with a Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> Customers of Crest are in one respect no more to the company than guinea pigs for marketing researchers, trying to see which package will bring in the most revenue.</li>
            <li> Also, my gums bled more while I brushed than with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used the first tube, and bought a second.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and suddenly realized what I did.  </li>
            <li> If there is a class action - count me in!</li>
            <li> Sounds like class action lawsuit time to me!</li>
            <li> After the first time I used this product, within 15-20 minutes I noticed a slimy white film in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Bought this last night without being aware of its reputation and brushed with it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> The texture is pretty gritty</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;ve tried other brands occasionally, but always returned to Crest as soon as the competing brand&#x27;s tube was finished.</li>
            <li> I started to notice my inner mouth felt funny afterwards, like the walls of my mouth sticking my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes pro-health different than other crest toothpastes, if it has an extra ingredient or a higher concentration of some ingredients, but I rather love it.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I thought it was related to me starting to drink tea but reading around, green tea is actually good for you (arguably) and does NOT stain teeth.  </li>
            <li> This may sound cleaning, but it strips way too much and leave your mouth almost raw in spots.</li>
            <li> For a few months, local stores had one gentle Crest alternative, a green-tea option in the \\&quot;expressions\\&quot; series; but this quickly ceased to be available either locally or online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my colgate total clean mint, thanks but no thanks crest.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like something like Armand-Hammer, which is more or less just baking soda.  </li>
            <li> but when my mouth and inside my lips  started becoming raw</li>
            <li> This toothpaste, more or less, agitates this, which may make your mouth appear worse before better.  </li>
            <li> Large lesions followed, and then swelling and hives on the outside of my lips.  </li>
            <li> There seem to be little gritty things (maybe baking soda) in it which helps serve as an abrasive to more thoroughly cle an my teeth.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product 4 days ago and am almost completely clear of the sores and lesions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they changed but all of the sudden in the last few months I experienced the same white slimy coating on my teeth and inside my cheeks.</li>
            <li> After a while I started having a sore throat and developed two sores, one on my lip and one inside my cheek.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued use about a week ago and all of my symptoms are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> i am surprised and intrigued/concerned.</li>
            <li> I feel a lawsuit coming after so many people have complained</li>
            <li> I simply brush my gums and inside of my mouth gently or use a washcloth to wipe those cells away.  </li>
            <li> I attribute that partly to my gentle Colgate electric toothbrush and to this gritty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> market\\&quot; capitalism today as if it were the real substance underlying political democracy in America (for which, to protect, we are urged to vote Republican</li>
            <li> CREST Pro-Health, Sensitive plus Enamel shield was causing swelling of the lips and sloughing of the lining of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> all directly attributed to this toothpaste.    </li>
            <li> In fact, after I brush, I completely forget that it does that</li>
            <li> When I told him, he wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My gums became extremely sensitive and started to ache and burn.  </li>
            <li> I was completely gobsmacked.</li>
            <li> WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m 51 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I had a my professional dental cleaning and check-</li>
            <li> A week later after my dental cleaning, my lower teeth stained so fast as if I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth for a year.  </li>
            <li> But for about 4 months I started to notice staining near where the bone met the gum line.  </li>
            <li> I told my dentist that I had this metallic taste in my mouth and that my gums and teeth feel sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised.</li>
            <li> I can only say that, when I use this toothpaste, my teeth look very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see the glowing reviews this toothpaste is receiving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that the FDA hasn&#x27;t gotten involved in this.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste is far too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I guess my mouth isn&#x27;t quite as sensitive as some others -</li>
            <li> This one comes with stannous fluoride, the one that can temporarily stain, but that is because this is for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dislike of this product is not because I do not have sensitive teeth, but rather</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive teeth, stannous fluoride toothpastes seem to be the norm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old posting from my mom&#x27;s Amazon account.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cant believe it.  </li>
            <li> So, off to find another toothpaste for sensitive teeth that doesn&#x27;t have stannous flouride in it.</li>
            <li> And this is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste is for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this Crest Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection today and upon my first use after rinsing out with water my mouth was noticeably somewhere between dry and foamy.</li>
            <li> I was ready to pitch this toothpaste in the trash and move back to my old Crest Tartar Control toothpaste, but I can&#x27;t discount the advantages of stannous fluoride (which is also, apparently, prevalent in mouthwashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it off, my mouth seriously felt anesthetized for some time after use.</li>
            <li> It may slightly defeat the purpose of brushing, but I tend to have hot tea pretty regularly throughout the day and some toothpastes just seem to linger for an hour, even longer and then alter the taste of my tea.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that this particular time you have eaten, drank and smoked various products and your mouth feel</li>
            <li> My recent 6-month dental check-up was better than usual.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was a defective one, but I bought it in a 2-pack and the second tube was the same exact way.  </li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening.</li>
            <li> After dental cleaning, teeth went 3 shades whiter and back to normal looking.</li>
            <li> To get the last of the toothpaste out, one has to press the tube together; you cannot roll it up like a normal tube.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Afterward, my mouth was full of dead cheek/gum tissue.</li>
            <li> then drive off to get some gas before work, and by the time I arrive at the station 5 minutes from my apartment, my mouth is full of slimy, dead skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing would calm it down.  </li>
            <li> MY MOUTH WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOING BACK TO MY OLD TOOTHPASTE...</li>
            <li> I usually used Crest Clean Mint.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with sensitivity in my mouth, but this toothpaste is designed to help with sensitive teeth and gums as well as doing all the other things I brush my teeth for: whitening, killing germs, fighting plaque and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems to clean our teeth like the usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am dismayed that they continue to sell it as it causes such serious side effects for many people.</li>
            <li> and it appears that there are several more serious side effects reported, with skin peeling off the inside of your mouth</li>
            <li> The sores were on every bit of soft tissue inside my mouth; from my gums, to under my tongue, my cheeks, the back of my throat and the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Once as I watched as two college-aged young women shopping together for toothpaste perused the shelves of variously differentiated Crest packages,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to my old toothpaste in the morning.</li>
            <li> I could barely talk.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve discovered posts and discussion on this issue dating back to 2007.</li>
            <li> AS WELL AS I DEVELOPED RED BUMPS &amp; BURNING ON INSIDES OF MY LIPS...</li>
            <li> Switched back to Crest w baking soda my old friend.</li>
            <li> result was a complete 180 from her advice the last time I saw her.  </li>
            <li> We use this kind/brand and normally buy it at Costco; however, we needed &amp;#34;cart filler&amp;#34; and bought this (and subsequently put it in a white elephant gift exchange...)</li>
            <li> First off, it isn&#x27;t as pasty as your typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether I have unique anti-fiberglass chemicals in my mouth, or if I&#x27;m immune to all pain, but I actually like this toothpaste quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sensitivity toothpastes, this one actually doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel funny</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t drink much coffee, tea or other drinks like that, so I can&#x27;t speak to the stain-fighting power.  </li>
            <li> but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like hydrogen peroxide in mouthwash, some people have significant negative reactions to Stannous Fluoride.  </li>
            <li> The paste cannot be easily cleaned away - and if you attempt to do so using sustained hot water, the tube&#x27;s contents will permanently transform into a fluid which slowly and continually oozes over your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I not only found that this was not a good sensitive mouth toothpaste, but it actually made my teeth feel more sensitive!</li>
            <li> Then my gums became bright red and irritated, my tongue was swollen and numb and the inside of my cheek was inflamed, swollen and irratated.</li>
            <li> It feels heavier than regular toothpaste, and it oozes slightly out of the tube, like I need to keep the top upright</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste and, much like the other critical reviews here, it burnt my mouth out.</li>
            <li> They even developed some minor bleeding issues again.  </li>
            <li> I did notice was that a day after I switched to it, my sensitive teeth were no longer sensitive - this after months of no results from &amp;#34;sensitive-tooth&amp;#34; toothpastes containing the active ingredient potassium nitrate (like Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, there were many other negative reviews on Amazon concerning this effect caused by Pro Health toothpaste, but they have all been mysteriously removed.</li>
            <li> To be \\&quot;modern?\\&quot; Modern people don&#x27;t like the idea of giant plastic things which served no useful purpose in the first place sitting in landfills for the next few thousand years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been my favorite toothpaste for a long time, i go out of my way to find it, and i&#x27;ve NEVER experienced issues like this.</li>
            <li> After reading other Amazon reviews about this product, I realized it was the toothpaste and stopped using it and now my mouth is free of clumps of dead skin!</li>
            <li> Then you are better off trying something else other than this dull, uneventful toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Even as I write that last paragraph, I&#x27;m now aware of a stinging, raw feeling on the inside of my left cheek, presumably from where the last piece of stringy white stuff came....    </li>
            <li> Also, this had that absorbing characteristic of other Crest Pro-Health products that I have tried, and I find its lasting sensation unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing this offers as an extra is the mouthwash flavor, and I think it&#x27;s pretty poor on the sensitivity front.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, and the minty flavor does not linger and make food taste bad.  </li>
            <li> After stopping the product a few days, my husband is back to normal.</li>
            <li> okay until a few minutes after I finished when there was just this flat bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a soft plastic with a flat lid, which I suppose is meant to let the toothpaste drop to the opening, but that really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> By the second week I was suffering from a burning sensation in my mouth, skin cells coming off my cheeks (that white stringy stuff) and a terribly dry mouth and throat.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because I hoped this would be a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Again, not only is taste impaired, but my mouth felt dry even when chewing on moist food.    </li>
            <li> Before I had used even half the tube, my teeth had become so sensitive that they bothered me around the clock.</li>
            <li> The inside of my mouth and the tip of my tongue feel burned and that slimely goo that developed within a half hour of brushing was the inside of my mouth peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now my lips get extremely dry with white film</li>
            <li> past Sunday I had just come back from my boyfriend&#x27;s and found that we had new</li>
            <li> EXPRESSED HERE AND AM GOING BACK TO PLAIN OLD CREST.  </li>
            <li> I never had sensitive teeth before, but now I have a hard time with cold, hot, and sweet things.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in the Crest Pro Health Series for treating sensitive teeth is different than the active ingredient in Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I am the only am the only one feeling it, till I read other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the semi-opaque thick whitish mucus consistency stuff is, but there is more production of it with this paste than with any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the back and the Sensodyne had the same active ingredient as the Crest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid I had gum disease until I saw so many people complaining about this toothpaste online</li>
            <li> Initially, the corners of my lips just cracked, then I developed small bumps and blisters which seeped.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 days, I finally switched to Tom&#x27;s natural toothpaste and the irritation seems to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> brushed my teeth early this morning as usual and my mouth was STINGING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh or abrasive for me, and I have rather sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I googled simply because I was curious if others felt the way I did about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest toothpaste for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Crest has come a long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough to suffer any of the other consequences mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Every time I fail to snap it properly, some more blue gooey stuff oozes out and makes a mess of my sink area.  </li>
            <li> continued trying different things until it dawned on me the other day that the Pro-Health may be the culprit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Heath toothpaste for years, since soon after it came out, and I have never noticed any sort of white slime or other issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me until I looked it up and saw lots of other people had the same thing happen.</li>
            <li> There are other switches, but given that they are way low on the list</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> very strange.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> After using it just twice, I have dry mouth and heartburn-like symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I had to pull it out of my dry, numbed mouth in gobs with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was my gums bleeding, but blood doesn&#x27;t stain unless it&#x27;s dry...</li>
            <li> I got dry mouth and burning tongue within 5-10 days.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity and dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else tried a different toothpaste with that active ingredient?</li>
            <li> Sorry, but your stannous flouride isn&#x27;t worth the physical discomfort and disgust</li>
            <li> I get the same effects from both of the active ingredients</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is a bit watery or runny compared to toothpastes that I&#x27;m used to, so that if the lid isn&#x27;t snapped completely in place, by the morning a bunch of the toothpaste has leaked onto the counter.</li>
            <li> This is not a new issue.</li>
            <li> To use the toothpaste, apply at least a one inch strip of it on a soft bristled toothbrush (I prefer to wet my brush first) and brush your teeth for at least a minute twice</li>
            <li> 6 months of using this product: I have multiple wear spots and dark brown stains on my teeth at the gumline, plus 2 enamel colored fillings are now yellow-beige.</li>
            <li> I was almost afraid to open the tube of Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> The back of my throat feels like it has chemical burns, and it feels like it&#x27;s traveling down my esophagus.  </li>
            <li> It does however, leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean but those white strings of skin cells are just disgusting!!!</li>
            <li> After switching to a different Crest toothpaste (a less fancy gel), I no longer had any problems.  </li>
            <li> Either immediately after or a half hour or so later.  </li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;ll go back to my previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but no more than 30 minutes later I&#x27;m pulling the stringy white slime out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I just did a little internet  research and it looks like tons of people have at the same problem with this product.</li>
            <li> While I am not in favor of the discourtesy of opening boxed products inside stores, I will do so to assure that I am buying a Crest product (so long as I stick with Crest) which has a conventional screw-on cap rather than flip-top.</li>
            <li> So here I am on the market for some above average product, one that can in one brush: clean, prevent, assist with the always present sign of bad breath?</li>
            <li> After so many bad reviews, I asked my dentist about this before using.  </li>
            <li> Apparently most people who use it end up with badly stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few white sores develop around my my teeth and the roof of my mouth also became irritated.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and began noticing a slimy, white residue from skin cells/skin soon after brushing.</li>
            <li> The military should drop it over the territories of enemy forces, as this stuff is chemical warfare.</li>
            <li> and it just oozes out of the cap until there is nothing left.  </li>
            <li> From reading a few recent ones, it sounds like crest is sending us flesh-eating fiberglass laced meth toothpaste.</li>
            <li> With that being said though, I really do not like this tootpaste.</li>
            <li> Today was the last straw; our housecleaner put the tube upside down in a tooth mug (not an unreasonable place for it) and  a few hours later I found that half an inch of paste had leaked into the bottom of the cup.  </li>
            <li> Health, rather than those ridiculous 4.2 oz tubes which they replaced the larger tubes with and raised the price at the same time . . . .  </li>
            <li> I did notice some of the issues when I first began using this type of toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 4+ years (rinse thoroughly now) and haven&#x27;t had a complaint since and no cavities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other stories of people brushing with Crest Pro-Health and suffering from \\&quot;slime\\&quot; or flecks of skin peeling away from their cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li> i wonder if this has to do with some other version??</li>
            <li> All other toothpastes I have ever tried use sodium flouride.  </li>
            <li> One extremely aggravating factor is the use of flip-tops instead of screw-on caps.</li>
            <li> If it is, it&#x27;s not funny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that happen to a lesser extent in the past</li>
            <li> I use a sensitivity toothpaste once a day and a non-sensitivity toothpaste during other times of the day.  </li>
            <li> I explained the details of my experience which included using other mouthwashes (Listerine, Pro-Health, Hydrogen Peroxide) and concentrating on my front teeth where I need an implant.</li>
            <li> I only used a trial from my dentist because I ran out of my usual Sensodyne and was in a pinch.</li>
            <li> There are other products that will protect against plaque that won&#x27;t make it look like we&#x27;ve somehow contracted a yeast infection in our mouths.</li>
            <li> I would use it like I would my other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t taste my food any more:(  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it didn&#x27;t contain some of the chemicals other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> There are also reports of mouth ulcers and loss of taste due to use of this</li>
            <li> In other words, it does everything I expect a toothpaste to do.</li>
            <li> box states under \\&quot;Other information\\</li>
            <li> but usually I was expecting that blue minty flavor because the gel is blue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong, until I read the fine print warning on Pro-Heath line and the negative reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> How could they have gone so far wrong with something as simple as toothpaste in a tube?  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient of the toothpaste (stannous fluoride) is no doubt beneficial, however P&amp;G should do something about the side effects.</li>
            <li> The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn&#x27;t listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a warning on the label that the active ingredient, Stannous fluoride, may stain the teeth.</li>
            <li> The FDA should not allow stannous flouride to be on the market- the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> That is the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this toothpaste is stannous fluoride.  </li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t speak to the side effects that other people have mentioned, but I can say this, this is the worst tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, and that includes the whitening stuff that doesn&#x27;t even try to taste good.</li>
            <li> one thing i have to say is that i don&#x27;t use the whitening version, i have always only used the base version in clean mint.</li>
            <li> As I write this review the inside of my lips are raw, tender, swollen, and sticking to my teeth because they are also dry.</li>
            <li> The only negative is price per ounce.  </li>
            <li> Twice in the past six months, I&#x27;ve experienced a terrible reaction (I believe from Crest Toothpaste) all over and around my lips.</li>
            <li> My stains were horribly dark blackish color.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a negative experience with toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> I brush at least twice daily and floss every day, just as I always have.</li>
            <li> but when I googled peeling skin I came across several people and one common thread...</li>
            <li> This is a green, gel-like toothpaste - I say gel-like, because it is like a gel blended with the signature chalky texture of just about every other crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so I switched to my previous type.</li>
            <li> Less tartar build-up, fresher breath,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only reviewing this because I don&#x27;t want them to discontinue the product after seeing so many horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> I always have that slight fear of buying things like this online in case</li>
            <li> Please do the absolute right thing and get this crap out of all stores everywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a mess all over my counters.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the peeling interior - and the slime is a drag, but I&#x27;ve kept at it the past 2 years because of the results.</li>
            <li> The skin on the inside of my mouth just began to peel off in little pieces, sort of like scalded milk.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> A little research</li>
            <li> I would say it may be a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Little did I know it was gonna eat up the inside of my lips and checks.</li>
            <li> That may be reassuring, but it does seem a little ironic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal.  </li>
            <li> I even went so far as to buy a humidifier because I thought it was the dry, cold weather.  </li>
            <li> What a messy, messy, oozy mess of a product.</li>
            <li> Never leaves a bad taste and keeps my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My assumption is that dead skin is a breading ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I regard the so called slimy cells as \\&quot;dead</li>
            <li> I have contacted Crest and the FDA regarding these harsh side effects of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was repeatably asked if I was having trouble breathing.</li>
            <li> I use different tooth pastes all the time, I have never experienced anything like this .</li>
            <li> Not great to use if you plan on having a romantic night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t whistle anymore because my mouth is so dried</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste sometime ago and after a few days I woke in the morning with the feeling that my throat was swelling shut.  </li>
            <li> and I see that some people have had trouble with it.</li>
            <li> and within a few days, my ulcers went away.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get that nasty slime, but eventually it left my lower lip completely raw and very swollen and the underside of my tongue is a bit swollen as well, which is posing a problem because it keeps getting caught in my permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> After about a day and a half it burnt my mouth out as well!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite describe what is wrong other than to say it is somewhat reminiscent of the flavors one experiences during a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> With the dry mouth came decreased sense of taste which made all food less palatable.  </li>
            <li> , I called the number listed on the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste tube (which is also the one in the company&#x27;s comments to other negative reviews).</li>
            <li> have not had the problems that some of the other reviewers have complained about.</li>
            <li> it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> this past Monday I thought I had a little canker sore in my mouth on my tongue.</li>
            <li> Having seen multiple similar accounts of bad reactions to this product, I&#x27;m wondering why it has not been taken off the market?  </li>
            <li> I actually cannot use toothpaste currently, it hurts that bad and needs to heal.</li>
            <li> One minor drawback, it&#x27;s very thick and a bit hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Then, I got a weird spot on my tongue several months ago.  </li>
            <li> I made an appointment with my dentist because I was sure something terrible was going on with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Instant sensitivity, metallic taste, and weird sensations in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Small sheets of skin would peel off.</li>
            <li> However, this toothpaste leaves a bunch of small visible scratches.  </li>
            <li> I had been using this toothpaste for the past month and noticed that each time after brushing my teeth, the skin inside my mouth would start to peel off.</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this exact toothpaste and just happened to see the terrible reviews for it.</li>
            <li> But, I was disgusted to learn that a reputable dental company, CRESTby Proctor and Gamble, was responsible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I am going to rectify the damage caused by your products, but it is going to have to be rectified.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the remaining.</li>
            <li> but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT SAFE FOR YOU FAMILY.</li>
            <li> it was the toothpaste causing this swelling and unbelievable soreness in my mouth.</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough horrible things about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really concerned by the amount of people who are having these weird, scary issues with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Beyond all the other potential problems it has, this toothpaste tastes so bad, I used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with my mouth for a year and a half that have gotten increasingly worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my mouth (gums, inner cheek) secrete a disgusting, almost snot-like mucus after brushing (layers of dead, burning skin apparently).  </li>
            <li> There was hardly any tarter to be removed</li>
            <li> I can hardly eat anything as my tongue is so sore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what portion of your product it is that causes this reaction, but I&#x27;m not interested in talking to you about it or even hearing how sorry you are.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> One doctor diagnosed cold sores and another simply \\&quot;lip inflammation.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> In the definitely negative category I&#x27;d put:    1.  </li>
            <li> Whiter Teeth (I say at least one shade whiter)</li>
            <li> There is no effective \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; in this respect.</li>
            <li> At least inform buyers about it.</li>
            <li> Probably too late for me to try all of them, but I wish someone would.</li>
            <li> Icky?</li>
            <li> I thought it was just the &amp;#34;canker sores&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve been having a lot of citrus fruit, lately.</li>
            <li> This should be negative stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was baffled to come her and find all of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FDA after you get your refund.  </li>
            <li> The packaging designer should be drawn and quartered, or at least banished to where he can never harm consumers again.</li>
            <li> Now my taste is slowly returning.</li>
            <li> It is thick and feels like it has lot of sand.</li>
            <li> It is not amazing</li>
            <li> I mean, this is TOOTHPASTE, not candy.</li>
            <li> I am disgusted every time I clean my counter tops.</li>
            <li> My mouth hasn&#x27;t gotten sore or raw like the other reviews but the skin peeling is so inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The bad aftertaste is its major weakness.</li>
            <li> This is no better or worse than others in this respect.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone has said, it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it is very uncomfortable especially when I try to put on lipstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is worse than a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The Crest team needs to seriously consider recalling this product.</li>
            <li> That was a little weird.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health line for little over a year and didn&#x27;t make the connection between bad, dark teeth staining on lower front teeth to Crest Pro-Health until this week.</li>
            <li> Overall really bad toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but only used it a couple of days because of the bad taste.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find that hundreds, if not thousands, of consumers using CREST PRODUCTS have experience the same symptoms!  </li>
            <li> I hate this toothpaste and wish things would clear up quicker.</li>
            <li> I have become so depressed lately because of my sore and swollen mucous membranes in my mouth, lack of taste, dry mouth, and bad breath that I have considered asking my doctor for an antidepressant.</li>
            <li> Promoted by Crest as providing six different benefits: cavities, gingivitis, plaque, whitening, sensitivity, and bad breath, I couldn&#x27;t imagine where this toothpaste would go wrong, given my past experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews sound horrible, and I&#x27;m truly sorry for those that are experiencing any symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But \\&quot;Tarde Piaci\\&quot; (too late to whine!).</li>
            <li> Do not make the same mistake I made, and stay well clear of this dreadful, dangerous toothpaste.</li>
            <li> DUH?!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Its pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> I will bear down and keep using it, albeit grudgingly.</li>
            <li> I also have dry mouth that no amount of water seems to cure and bad breath.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is unhealthy.    </li>
            <li> The longer I used it, the worse this condition got.  </li>
            <li> When it kept getting worse</li>
            <li> At some point in that time, I was getting sporadic episodes of having stringy &#x27;material&#x27; around my gums, or worse - reaching the corners of my mouth.</li>
            <li> But, it seemed to get worse, and i found no explanation online for it....    </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is TOXIC and CAUSTIC.</li>
            <li> I have a different reason, I hate the cap.  </li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;ll stop after a while, but it just got worse.  </li>
            <li> I had approximately 5 ulcers in my mouth at once after a week&#x27;s time had passed.</li>
            <li> Yesterday my tongue and the bottom of my mouth felt worse and today was AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hardly any plaque equals &#x3D; hardly any unpleasant scraping at my appointment.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it to be nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers do.  </li>
            <li> (you think these reviews are bad, just go to the Consumer Affairs website, holy cow).  </li>
            <li> I keep seeing that Crest is sorry to see that some of us have had a horrible experience with their products, but the real issue here is that your product is hurting people.</li>
            <li> My husband could not  figure out why I was crying and it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> Wow, this toothpaste is awful.  </li>
            <li> I was sufficiently irritated that I decided to write this review to warn the world about this deeply flawed product.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use this without it dripping out of my mouth while brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is gritty and leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else, it gave me this nasty white slime on my lips and on the inside of my mouth!</li>
            <li> On top of that it gives me the worst taste and bad breath!!!!</li>
            <li> It was really frightening.</li>
            <li> Crest advises that if the experience is too uncomfortable, \\&quot;discontinue use.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I switched to another product and am unlikely to ever buy another Crest product.</li>
            <li> It has been a costly, uncomfortable ordeal.</li>
            <li> Its like brushing your teeth with a grainy fake sugary substance.</li>
            <li> I determined there was something really wrong with the Crest Pro-health toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I went to urgent care because the pain was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> That was weird, too.</li>
            <li> And that isn&#x27;t weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got to the point where I was wondering if something was wrong, and I checked the reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Crest seems to be turning a blind eye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where this toothpaste goes wrong is in the flavor.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong... right?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It is horrific that a company creates a product that should benefit your teeth and it actually damages them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic dongle makes it difficult to get the paste out; my girlfriend ends up squirting toothpaste all over the place (or</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> then the dry mouth took over and is totally miserable.</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible, is runny and before the tube was half gone</li>
            <li> Also, I normally do not have bad breath, but I seemed to develop horrible breath after using this.</li>
            <li> I also had numb tongue and a burning sensation on my lips and the tip of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> My tongue felt numb or chemically burned, and these symptoms went on for a week before I called my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Makes my taste buds numb for a while.</li>
            <li> It is dangerous stuff which the manufacturer does not highlight on the packet.</li>
            <li> I had just been getting over a cold</li>
            <li> so I thought it might have to do with the cold I had.</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t realize what had caused this and thought I had an infection from my cold.</li>
            <li> The front part of my tongue has become all tingly and numb to taste.</li>
            <li> It is not acceptable that a toothpaste stains teeth a week after your expensive dental cleaning!</li>
            <li> and I have to admit that if I had read the reviews I wouldn&#x27;t have picked it - some of those reviews are scary!  </li>
            <li> It was highly unpleasant, but stopped when I discontinued use.  </li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t unpleasant in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Somewhat unpleasant as you can imagine (or relate, if you&#x27;ve used this stuff).&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s unpleasant.</li>
            <li> While I can force myself to brush with it, the taste is decidedly unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I had horrible, HORRIBLE sensitivity, my gums tingled and felt like they were on fire, and I had a constant metallic taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The cap makes it impossible to seal the damn thing.</li>
            <li> Believe the bad hype.  </li>
            <li> They became so bad, I sought a MD&#x27;s opinion who prescribed me a mouth paste to apply on the lesions, but he was stumped as to what the cause could have been.  </li>
            <li> Bad taste in mouth.  </li>
            <li> While I never got complaints from my wife about bad breath while using this stuff, within a couple of hours of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a bad taste in my mouth which eating or drinking would lessen, but not eliminate.    </li>
            <li> Does anyone know what ingredient is causing these bad reactions?</li>
            <li> but, never as bad as with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It gets so bad, that almost anything that comes in contact w/</li>
            <li> caused her lips to be badly blistered, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> I never thought it would stain so badly.  </li>
            <li> hygienist looked at my teeth today and commented on how badly they are stained.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> - I find it doesn&#x27;t taste bad when I am brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> It is clearly very dangerous and should be recalled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no earthy-crunchy type, but I found it wasteful and stupid: and it doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that bad!!!  </li>
            <li> It is horrible!</li>
            <li> Just tastes awful.  </li>
            <li> I just hope that these effects go away soon, it truly is awful.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothpaste ever!  </li>
            <li> who had a horrible reaction to this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the worst toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this toothpaste to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> It was so disgusting!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product, please save your money and sense of well-being by not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> The whitening version does have a nasty aftertaste, which &amp;#34;clean mint&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to have.</li>
            <li> my lips burns them horribly.</li>
            <li> worst of all, when I&#x27;m done brushing and rinsing (and I rinse well)</li>
            <li> , it leaves a terrible, chemical aftertaste in the mouth that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and had a worst feeling after brushing in the morning.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible!</li>
            <li> Really horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disgusting that I almost start to gag when I put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am thoroughly disgusted.  </li>
            <li> I now have the worst canker sore in my mouth and it hurts to talk, let alone brush my teeth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> How could they have gone so far wrong with something as simple as toothpaste in a tube?  There are two problems with this product; the paste is too goopy, and the hinged lid doesn&#x27;t snap firmly enough.  Either problem in isolation might be manageable but together they are a recipe for disaster.  Every time I fail to snap it properly, some more blue gooey stuff oozes out and makes a mess of my sink area.  Today was the last straw; our housecleaner put the tube upside down in a tooth mug (not an unreasonable place for it) and  a few hours later I found that half an inch of paste had leaked into the bottom of the cup.  I was sufficiently irritated that I decided to write this review to warn the world about this deeply flawed product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is unhealthy.    All one has to do is a search using the product&#x27;s name and \\&quot;consumer complaints\\&quot; - the reading material is a wake-up call.</li>
            <li> I have used various Crest toothpastes/gels for years without any problem.  However, when I began using the Crest Pro Health toothpaste my throat was sore and the back of my tongue was somewhat swollen.  After visiting my doctor and an ENT they finally decided that I should try another toothpaste because I was likely allergic to Crest Pro Health.  After switching to a different Crest toothpaste (a less fancy gel), I no longer had any problems.  I hope someone at Procter and Gamble does some tests to find out why many people (including myself) are having an allergic reaction to this toothpaste.  This may be great toothpaste for some people, but my suggestion is to buy a different product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest ProHealth since it first came on the market about 2 years ago(?)  I love this toothpaste!  My daughter and I both use it twice a day.  I&#x27;ve even gotten a couple of my friends hooked on it as well.    I use this toothpaste with my Sonicare and feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning!  It has polishers--feels like \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but they dissolve quickly  (reminds me of the old Pop Rocks candy in miniature).  Also, the consistency is a runnier than the old-fashioned paste.  However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.  So I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a mess all over my counters.  One thing that I&#x27;ve seen most other reviewers complain about is skin sloughing.  I experienced this for a day or two when I first started using the product.  It wasn&#x27;t that bad!!!  My assumption is that dead skin is a breading ground for bacteria.</li>
            <li> While using this toothpaste for several months, my husband, age 69, suffered lip sores and peeling and had a red ring around his mouth.  One doctor diagnosed cold sores and another simply \\&quot;lip inflammation.\\&quot;  The prescribed medicines did not help.  We finally got on line and learned about the similar problems others have had.  After stopping the product a few days, my husband is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I love the taste, I love the \\&quot;grit\\&quot;, I love the mouth feel. The best toothpase out there for people who love cinnamon. One minor drawback, it&#x27;s very thick and a bit hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> This is a product that you buy because it gets results, not for the taste.  Personally, I like something like Armand-Hammer, which is more or less just baking soda.  This is a little more gritty/industrial.  Not as good as a whitening treatment, but will certainly help that.    Some people have talked about being de-sensitized to taste, perhaps because of the zinc.  This has not happened to me.</li>
            <li> I normally use another type of Crest, but Crest Pro-Health was on sale and I wanted to try it. It is horrible! The month slime everyone talks about is gross yet so true. The toothpaste is too strong. This slime is actually a collection of cells the toothpaste has stripped from your mouth. This may sound cleaning, but it strips way too much and leave your mouth almost raw in spots. I didn&#x27;t realize this toothpaste was causing all this until I went online to read reviews. Rinsing doesn&#x27;t help. After you stop using it for a week, your mouth should return to normal. Also, I normally do not have bad breath, but I seemed to develop horrible breath after using this. It doesn&#x27;t whiten well at all.     I really can&#x27;t say enough horrible things about it. I would never recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Probably very effective, but the texture is grainy and the taste is very strong and not appealing.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 7.8-Ounce (Pack of 4) Lacks! Let&#x27;s just say that this particular time you have eaten, drank and smoked various products and your mouth feel like is in dire need of a Car Wash type washing, absolute revitalizing, let&#x27;s start brand new type of feeling! Then you are better off trying something else other than this dull, uneventful toothpaste! I buy in bulk so it has taken longer to learn to dislike it and by now I give it 2 Stars. Why not 1  Star since  I sound so aggravated and displeased by it?  Because of the Intimidation Factor! That aside, this is one I will not be coming back to, as soon as it departs (fully consumed, cheap bastard that I am!) it will not be on anyone&#x27;s Wish List. We are moving on to better and more satisfying options, that&#x27;s for sure! No, I am not a dentist and I pay dearly on a daily basis for not having taken better care of my grill and for that I am truly sorry. But \\&quot;Tarde Piaci\\&quot; (too late to whine!). So here I am on the market for some above average product, one that can in one brush: clean, prevent, assist with the always present sign of bad breath?, fight and win cavities and gum issues, you get what I am saying? The Daddy O&#x27;, The Big Papa of Toothpastes! 2 Stars for (great boxing, by the way, reeled me in like an innocent flounder!) Crest Pro Health!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other stories of people brushing with Crest Pro-Health and suffering from \\&quot;slime\\&quot; or flecks of skin peeling away from their cheeks and lips. It definitely is caused by the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and it&#x27;s amazing the FDA allows products like this to be sold in the U.S.    The same thing happened to me about a year ago after my dentist&#x27;s hygienist gave me a free trial tube of this junky toothpaste. The skin on the inside of my mouth just began to peel off in little pieces, sort of like scalded milk. I gave that sample to a friend figuring it was just me reacting -- but the same oral skin peeling nonsense happened to him as well.    Everyone should toss Crest Pro-Health into the garbage and ask for a refund.    By the way, there were many other negative reviews on Amazon concerning this effect caused by Pro Health toothpaste, but they have all been mysteriously removed. Very strange.</li>
            <li> After so many bad reviews, I asked my dentist about this before using.  He told me that there are problems for some people, if those people are not cleaning their teeth properly and have a plaque or bacteria issue.  This toothpaste, more or less, agitates this, which may make your mouth appear worse before better.  If that happens, a simple dental cleaning will solve things for you.    With that said, most people won&#x27;t have any issues.  I certainly didn&#x27;t.  This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste about three weeks ago.  After my first use I noticed there was white, stringy, saliva in my mouth.  I also had numb tongue and a burning sensation on my lips and the tip of my tongue.  I did not at first associate this with the toothpaste, however, so I continued to use it.  By the second week I was suffering from a burning sensation in my mouth, skin cells coming off my cheeks (that white stringy stuff) and a terribly dry mouth and throat.  After a while I started having a sore throat and developed two sores, one on my lip and one inside my cheek.  Finally it dawned on me that all of this had started when I began to use the toothpaste.  I discontinued use about a week ago and all of my symptoms are almost completely gone.  I continue to have a problem with dry mouth, but it seems to be getting better each day.  I highly recommend that you DO NOT USE this toothpaste.  It is clearly very dangerous and should be recalled.  I did a search online and found many consumer complaints against this product.  I am dismayed that they continue to sell it as it causes such serious side effects for many people.</li>
            <li> wow. i didn&#x27;t know there was this whole problem with pro health toothpaste and people having sore lips and tissue sloughing. this is concerning and fascinating to me as i have used crest pro health, clean mint, for YEARS. it&#x27;s been my favorite toothpaste for a long time, i go out of my way to find it, and i&#x27;ve NEVER experienced issues like this. i am surprised and intrigued/concerned. one thing i have to say is that i don&#x27;t use the whitening version, i have always only used the base version in clean mint. i wonder if this has to do with some other version?? perhaps it&#x27;s an allergy that not all users experience? very strange. i am considering switching to another brand until i know more. one thing i do know is the fewer chemicals we put in our bodies the better.</li>
            <li> My gums and the insides of my cheeks peeled when I started using this product.  It was highly unpleasant, but stopped when I discontinued use.  I definitely recommend against this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really concerned by the amount of people who are having these weird, scary issues with this toothpaste. I have been using it for years with NONE of the symptoms others are talking about. It&#x27;s the only type I use! I love it!</li>
            <li> Believe the bad hype.  This stuff makes my mouth (gums, inner cheek) secrete a disgusting, almost snot-like mucus after brushing (layers of dead, burning skin apparently).  Either immediately after or a half hour or so later.  I was afraid I had gum disease until I saw so many people complaining about this toothpaste online and all had the same reaction I have.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for about 2 months before the horror of what I was putting in my mouth set-in.  While I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of the product, I had always trusted the Crest name and assumed this product would hold up to previously experienced quality standards.  Wow, was I wrong.  After my husband and I started using our 2nd tube of this product, I began to experience what I believed were canker sores inside my mouth.  Large lesions followed, and then swelling and hives on the outside of my lips.  My tongue felt numb or chemically burned, and these symptoms went on for a week before I called my dentist.  She recommended it could be stress, and to wait another week and let her know how I was doing.  She also recommended I make sure I brushed my teeth twice daily.  Little did she know she was sentencing me to two more weeks of incredible pain, and open sores.  The sores were on every bit of soft tissue inside my mouth; from my gums, to under my tongue, my cheeks, the back of my throat and the roof of my mouth.  They became so bad, I sought a MD&#x27;s opinion who prescribed me a mouth paste to apply on the lesions, but he was stumped as to what the cause could have been.  It wasn&#x27;t until I woke up one morning and realized the sores of that day were most prevalent in the areas of my mouth that the toothpaste most likely settled in when I brushed the night before.  (both sides of the inside of my lips where the brush always rubbed, the area where the gums met my cheeks on top and bottom and in the back of my mouth and throat)  That morning, it finally dawned on me it must be the toothpaste. Thank God I figured this out.  I stopped using this product 4 days ago and am almost completely clear of the sores and lesions.  Please Crest, do the right thing and recall this product immediately.  Until I see you stand up and do the right thing for your consumers, I will go out of my way to never purchase another Crest or Proctor and Gamble Product.</li>
            <li> I used at least a full large tube of both the clean mint and the cinnamon versions of this.  As with other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used over the last 10 years or more, I always brush my teeth with a Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush.    The only good effect of this product is that it does seem to whiten my teeth a bit compared to toothpastes without whitening agents.    In the neutral category I&#x27;d put taste and the feeling of a clean mouth immediately afterward.  This is no better or worse than others in this respect.  Sensitivity protection is also adequate as such products go, but not as good as Crest&#x27;s specific Sensitivity toothpastes which, for my sensitive teeth, work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.    In the definitely negative category I&#x27;d put:    1.  Mouth slime.  Others have mentioned this, and it is real.  I&#x27;m not sure what the semi-opaque thick whitish mucus consistency stuff is, but there is more production of it with this paste than with any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is a constant problem when using this product routinely.  It does not just form after brushing and then you get rid of it and it&#x27;s gone.  It keeps forming.    2.  Dry mouth.  The longer I used it, the worse this condition got.  Toward the end of my usage, the sensation was so strong that my mouth felt dry even when I was swishing water around in my mouth.  Ugh!    3.  Sense of taste impairment.  With the dry mouth came decreased sense of taste which made all food less palatable.  Again, not only is taste impaired, but my mouth felt dry even when chewing on moist food.    4.  Bad taste in mouth.  While I never got complaints from my wife about bad breath while using this stuff, within a couple of hours of use I&#x27;d get a bad taste in my mouth which eating or drinking would lessen, but not eliminate.    5.  Drippy.  It was difficult to use this without it dripping out of my mouth while brushing.  The cinnamon is more paste-like and softer and is even more of a problem this way than the cool mint which has a more gel-like consistency.  Both dripped on my shirt more than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.    I am not a Crest hater.  My favorite toothpaste long term is Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity with Scope and Whitening.  It has sensitivity protection second only to Crest&#x27;s Sensitivity Original Formula, adequate whitening, no mouth irritation, minimal mouth slime, very fresh feeling and fresh breath, no bad taste in my mouth hours afterward, no dry mouth or taste impairment, and no drippiness.  The only negative is price per ounce.  I wish they still made it in a large tube like the 8.2 oz Pro.Health, rather than those ridiculous 4.2 oz tubes which they replaced the larger tubes with and raised the price at the same time . . . .  Still, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> After several months of use my mouth became irritated and red as if it were burned and my lips became swollen and cracked. When it kept getting worse I realized it may be the toothpaste so I switched to my previous type. After about a week my mouth returned to normal so I tried the Pro Health again.   I had an immediate reaction that took 5 days to heal.   My mouth is in excellent health as long as I don&#x27;t use this toothpaste. My husband is now beginning to react to it in a similar way as I do. There is some ingrediant in this product that causes damage to the mucus membranes and it should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste twice because I liked the taste and I thought maybe the first trial&#x27;s effects were by chance, but it&#x27;s true- this toothpaste makes the topmost lining of your cheeks come off. You&#x27;ll notice it throughout the day, thinking you have unchewed food stuff in your teeth or something, only to reach into your mouth and pull out a big string of skin cells (or whatever it is).  The problem goes away when you stop using the toothpaste.  I will not buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the low ratings. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste twice a day for over a month and I see a noticeble difference: Whiter Teeth (I say at least one shade whiter) Less tartar build-up, fresher breath, and my teeth feel clean and smooth for hours afterwards! The taste isn&#x27;t unpleasant in my opinion. In fact, it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; as a lot of mint flavored products I&#x27;ve come across. I mean, this is TOOTHPASTE, not candy. Right?! Yes, it has kind of a grainy texture, but I think that is one of reasons why it cleans my teeth so well. It&#x27;s not too harsh or abrasive for me, and I have rather sensitive teeth. This is my absolute favorite toothpaste! From now on, I&#x27;ll be buying this in bulk on Amazon. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Just tastes awful.  I used it for three days and can&#x27;t go on.  My container is 4.2 oz and I am throwing out the last 4.0oz.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> Makes the insides of my mouth peel off. Makes my taste buds numb for a while. Overall really bad toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Wow, this toothpaste is awful.  After using it just twice, I have dry mouth and heartburn-like symptoms.  The back of my throat feels like it has chemical burns, and it feels like it&#x27;s traveling down my esophagus.  I have used Crest whitening with Scope and had no issue; I liked it in fact.  I think it&#x27;s the stannus flouride in this product that is causing the problem.  All other toothpastes I have ever tried use sodium flouride.  Stannus flouride is supposed to be really great for your teeth, but I just cannot use this product.  After reading all these reviews, Crest really should recall the product.  I feel a lawsuit coming after so many people have complained (you think these reviews are bad, just go to the Consumer Affairs website, holy cow).  I wish I could give this product no stars.  I just hope that these effects go away soon, it truly is awful.  Thanks, Crest (tone&#x3D;sarcasm).</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste a couple of weeks ago and, like others, noticed some irritation and peeling about a week later.  I didn&#x27;t associate it with the toothpaste but yesterday, when I was getting my teeth cleaned, my hygenist noticed that I had several areas where the tissue in my mouth was sloughing and asked if I was using Pro Health.  She said that she&#x27;s seen tons of people who use that brand and have similar issues and sent me home with a tube of basic Crest.  Her advice was to avoid any toothpaste with extra \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; and stick to the most basic formulas.</li>
            <li> My entire family enjoy the taste of this toothpaste . It gives me a clean feeling on my teeth all day long ....</li>
            <li> Six months ago when I first used this product I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling.  It took me awhile to realize it was the toothpaste. I stopped using it and switched to a different brand. The skin peeling went away.   Tonight six months later I decided to use it again as my paste was out and my husband still uses this brand.   Immediately I noticed my lips swell and my mouth felt burned. 20 minutes later the lining of skin in my mouth is peeling off.   Terrible product. Tossing this out. No one should use something with such hash chemicals.</li>
            <li> I, too, have skin slough but I also have that from Listerine pre-rinse mouthwash.  This paste has a mild flavor (\\&quot;clean cinnamon\\&quot;) and a gritty texture.  It does not make my mouth sore and I regard the so called slimy cells as \\&quot;dead cells\\&quot; that needed to be removed anyway.  I simply brush my gums and inside of my mouth gently or use a washcloth to wipe those cells away.  My recent 6-month dental check-up was better than usual.  I attribute that partly to my gentle Colgate electric toothbrush and to this gritty toothpaste.  There was hardly any tarter to be removed and I have  been using the paste once a day for only two months.  My concern is that the gritty texture may be erosive to the enamel.  I was hoping to find a comment from a dentist concerning this possibility.</li>
            <li> The problem is that Crest has put marketing above delivering a suitable product. The company fills the shelves of your local big box store with a dazzeling variety of boxes which, essentially, compete for the gullible buyer&#x27;s desire for \\&quot;white\\&quot; teeth. Once Crest gets into the customer&#x27;s cart the \\&quot;whitener\\&quot; of his or her choice, the company has no concern about how the product works for the customer. One extremely aggravating factor is the use of flip-tops instead of screw-on caps. The flip-tops simply do not close, once the tube is being used. The contents solidify as a paste all over the cap, preventing future closure. The paste cannot be easily cleaned away - and if you attempt to do so using sustained hot water, the tube&#x27;s contents will permanently transform into a fluid which slowly and continually oozes over your bathroom counter. While I am not in favor of the discourtesy of opening boxed products inside stores, I will do so to assure that I am buying a Crest product (so long as I stick with Crest) which has a conventional screw-on cap rather than flip-top. Once as I watched as two college-aged young women shopping together for toothpaste perused the shelves of variously differentiated Crest packages, each variety proclaiming its \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; capabilities in slightly different articulation, one blurted out - with no apparent sense of irony - that she wanted to be sure to get the one version which would make her teeth the whitest. For a few months, local stores had one gentle Crest alternative, a green-tea option in the \\&quot;expressions\\&quot; series; but this quickly ceased to be available either locally or online. Evidently it appealed to too reasonable - and thus too rare -  buyers simply wanting a non-corrosive toothpaste to clean their teeth, without any ridicuous representations akin to the ads even on these amazon.com pages showing gorgeous 20-year-old models with wide-open mouths full of cosmetically enhanced white teeth. The irony in the proliferation of packageclaims is that, while the packages reveal a variety of chemical content, only an expert in toothpaste bio-chemistry can understand the true variation among these options. Meanwhile most manufacturers of household products today do not care to hear the views of customers or to take into account what any member of their corporate board, for instance, would discover if he or she actually made a point of trying out the product to assess its quality. There is no effective \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; in this respect. I had thought about mailing back my tube of melted slime which would not stay inside the bottle, but realized that this might only garner me a visit from the FBI or postal inspectors if I addressed a padded envelope to a corporate official. Customers of Crest are in one respect no more to the company than guinea pigs for marketing researchers, trying to see which package will bring in the most revenue. This is the simulacrum of &#x27;democracy&#x27; touted by advocates of unregulated \\&quot;free market\\&quot; capitalism today as if it were the real substance underlying political democracy in America (for which, to protect, we are urged to vote Republican, we owe so dang much to those in the million dollar plus income bracket!)</li>
            <li> I have been using crest pro health toothpaste for well over a year.  I have never had a paste that leaves my mouth feeling clean for hours after.  Its wonderful!  I will never use another toothpaste again!  My teeth and gums have never been in such good condition as with pro health toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Before I had used even half the tube, my teeth had become so sensitive that they bothered me around the clock. I stopped using it over three months ago and my teeth are still very sensitive. My dentist prescribed a special fluoride toothpaste that has helped some, but it discolors my teeth. I wish I had never, ever used the Crest Pro-Health. I never had sensitive teeth before, but now I have a hard time with cold, hot, and sweet things. Do not make the same mistake I made, and stay well clear of this dreadful, dangerous toothpaste. It ought to be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothpaste ever!  I, like many others have experienced the peeling of my mouth, extremely dry lips, bumps on my lip, sore mouth, etc.  I even went so far as to buy a humidifier because I thought it was the dry, cold weather.  I have contacted Crest and the FDA regarding these harsh side effects of this toothpaste.  This should be pulled off the market immediately!  I hate this toothpaste and wish things would clear up quicker.</li>
            <li> I used CrestPro-Health (Clinical Gum Protection ) for the first time this morning. I immediately had an intense burning sensation in the right side of my cheek. With in 10 ten minutes I had a large blister form in the right side of my cheek. Several hours into my work day, I could not move my neck to the right side. I felt a huge lump under my right ear, and the right side of my face was swollen, hot and red. Thank god I work in a medical facility which administers Chemotherapy and knows how to handle reactions. I went to my nurse manager,who then went and got our Physician Assistant and Head Pharmacist. I told them about using the Crest Pro-Health this morning. I was immediately given 50mg of Benadryl and Prednison. They all agreed I was having a severe reaction to the Crest-Pro-Health. I was repeatably asked if I was having trouble breathing. I remained calm but I was terrified. Later one of the nurses printed off your reviews for me. I guess I&#x27;m not alone. Why is this product still on the market? I use different tooth pastes all the time, I have never experienced anything like this . I am so glad I was at work when this happened.&lt;br /&gt;Terrifying experience.</li>
            <li> who had a horrible reaction to this toothpaste.  Same thing as everyone else: the skin in my mouth started sloughing off.  I agree that this product should be recalled.  Does anyone know what ingredient is causing these bad reactions?</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health for about a month and during this period My gums became very irritated.  A few white sores develop around my my teeth and the roof of my mouth also became irritated. I didn&#x27;t realize that the toothpaste was the cause until I read complaints about the product. I have stopped using this product and hope my oral health returns. There is something in this toothpaste that causes a reaction in some people like myself.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the worst toothpaste I have ever used. It is gritty and leaves a terrible taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this toothpaste to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> I should have read reviews before buying but like many others I bought this on sale and wanted to see if it was as good as the ads on TV say it is. It ISN\\&quot;T!! It tastes terrible, is runny and before the tube was half gone I started to lose my sense of taste.  I looked up the sympton of taste lose and it was brain tumor, infection, etc. Then I found the reviews here and stopped using the toothpaste. Now my taste is slowly returning. No brain tumor. Yea!!</li>
            <li> More of this toothpaste gets wasted oozing out onto the counter, the packaging cannot seem to control the product oozing out into the drawer, onto the counter, etc. What a messy, messy, oozy mess of a product. I am disgusted every time I clean my counter tops.</li>
            <li> I began to look for things in my diet that might be causing the lining of my mouth to slough and was about to stop drinking my favorite tea when an Internet search helped me determine that it was my new toothpaste that was causing the problem.  CREST Pro-Health, Sensitive plus Enamel shield was causing swelling of the lips and sloughing of the lining of the mouth.  Having seen multiple similar accounts of bad reactions to this product, I&#x27;m wondering why it has not been taken off the market?  Also, to my horror, all complaints pages on the Internet are accompanied by ads for the offending product!  DUH?!  AND...the packaging does not include a complete list of ingredients...is that legal?  My next move is to contact the FDA.</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else, it gave me this nasty white slime on my lips and on the inside of my mouth! It was so disgusting!!! On top of that it gives me the worst taste and bad breath!!!!</li>
            <li> If it is, it&#x27;s not funny. I purchased this after analyzing the box and the claims it made about dental health, etc. I used it twice before searching the internet to see if I wasn&#x27;t the only person to experience bizarre problems with this toothpaste. Both times I used it, my cheeks and gums appeared to lighten up by many shades while I simultaneously felt a drying, chemical-y sensation to my whole mouth. It was so intense I thought I was having an allergic reaction the second time. Afterward, my mouth was full of dead cheek/gum tissue. It was really frightening. I&#x27;ve had that happen to a lesser extent in the past but, never as bad as with this toothpaste. I had to pull it out of my dry, numbed mouth in gobs with my fingers. To top it off, my mouth seriously felt anesthetized for some time after use. Also, my gums bled more while I brushed than with any other toothpaste. Then my teeth hurt so much where my gums bled! I honestly can&#x27;t help but think of some horror movie where I&#x27;ve been poisoned and my teeth are falling out. It reminds me of the effects drugs or radiation have on people! This is a terrible product, please save your money and sense of well-being by not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and began noticing a slimy, white residue from skin cells/skin soon after brushing. I have never had this issue before and have excellent dental hygiene. This doesn&#x27;t seem safe and I have stopped using this product altogether. Do not buy unless you want a chemical burn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing this problem for a month or two. Being a self-deprecating, &#x27;the fault lies within&#x27;-type of person, I never considered this issue could be caused by a product I was using.     I bought Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste based on a good experience using my sister&#x27;s toothpaste when we were visiting our parents. I bought some when I returned home. I used the first tube, and bought a second. At some point in that time, I was getting sporadic episodes of having stringy &#x27;material&#x27; around my gums, or worse - reaching the corners of my mouth. I assumed it was just &#x27;me,&#x27; something about how my glands were producing saliva.... But, it seemed to get worse, and i found no explanation online for it....    Until I began to equate the problem with the TIMING of the problem. Always in the mornings - either after I&#x27;ve brushed, or when I wake up after having brushed. Then, I looked online for similar stories and found account after account of what&#x27;s being called \\&quot;Stringy White Mucus,\\&quot; all directly attributed to this toothpaste.    I still don&#x27;t know exactly what this material is. Some people speculate it&#x27;s the lining of your mouth, sloughing off. I first assumed it was just gooey residue from the toothpaste, congealing into a sort of stringy paste. But, I seem to have found a response to another problem-sufferer, and the emailed reply indicates it IS an affect of the product being so strong that it tears at the lining of the mouth. Crest advises that if the experience is too uncomfortable, \\&quot;discontinue use.\\&quot; So, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing. Even as I write that last paragraph, I&#x27;m now aware of a stinging, raw feeling on the inside of my left cheek, presumably from where the last piece of stringy white stuff came....    So, that&#x27;s it. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a month now. I&#x27;ve been getting massive amounts of skin/film peeling from the inside of my cheeks. I had it rarely before but more recurrent when I started using this toothpaste. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the toothpaste until my husband mentioned it might be the culprit. My mouth hasn&#x27;t gotten sore or raw like the other reviews but the skin peeling is so inconvenient. It doesn&#x27;t happen right away. In fact, after I brush, I completely forget that it does that and as I&#x27;m trying to sleep, I&#x27;m awakened by slime in my mouth. Not great to use if you plan on having a romantic night. It&#x27;ll ruin goodnight kisses. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I used this for a while and noticed the mouth slime problem others were having, but didn&#x27;t attribute it to the toothpaste and just put up with it. Recently, I took a good look at the inside of my mouth and my teeth were all getting stained, despite my brushing two times a day, flossing, and using mouthwash. I then realized I had been using stannous fluoride toothpaste instead of regular sodium fluoride. Do not buy this; stick with sodium fluoride.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro health and within a day I started feeling the tip of my tongue swelling and getting sore. I could see the taste buds all red and raised. Its been a week now and I realized that it is because of this toothpaste. I can hardly eat anything as my tongue is so sore. I have stopped using it and hope to get better in a few days. Will never buy Crest products again.</li>
            <li> While the product really has wonderful toothe cleansing and whitening result I ended up with a BURNT arm and also burns around ny lips. Shame because the product does thoroughly cleans your teeth. I now wrap my arm in cling foil and put paraffin oil around my lips if I need to use it. It is dangerous stuff which the manufacturer does not highlight on the packet. BEWARE</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this toothpaste, my teeth hurt. At first I thought it was because I drank too much soda that day.  But now it has gotten to the point that as soon as I brush the paste over my teeth, I feel the pain.  I use a sensitivity toothpaste once a day and a non-sensitivity toothpaste during other times of the day.  I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity until I started using Crest Pro-Health. It has to do with the ingredients in the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Three days ago, approximately 2 1/2 months after my dental hygienist gave me a free sample of this toothpaste and I continued to use it, I brushed my teeth and felt as if I had just burned the inside of my top lip on a hot pizza. I could feel a raised ridge inside my lip. The burning sensation diminished, but is still there and I now have four blisters in that area.  At first, I didn&#x27;t connect the burning with the toothpaste. However, upon going to the Internet to discover what might have caused this problem, I found that similar reactions had happened to others, and immediately realized it had happened to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 12, I called the number listed on the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste tube (which is also the one in the company&#x27;s comments to other negative reviews). A pleasant customer service representative heard my complaint and referred me to a health professional for the company. I explained the details of my experience which included using other mouthwashes (Listerine, Pro-Health, Hydrogen Peroxide) and concentrating on my front teeth where I need an implant. I explained I was not necessarily seeking health advice, but only wanted to register my concerns. We agreed that perhaps it was the combination of all my efforts regarding the front teeth that produced the response I experienced. Still, I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> So, now I know why my gum line is receding and why my enamel has been destroyed since using this for several months. I think Crest owes me some dental crowns now and gum grafting. Worst product ever !!!!! Does NOT whiten!!! The only reason you got a star is because I had to give you one to post this warning to consumers.</li>
            <li> MY DENTAL HYGENIST RECOMMENDED THAT I USE THIS TOOTH PASTE.  HAVING BEEN A REGULAR USER OF CREST FOR MANY YEARS I BOUGHT A TUBE AND USED IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS.  AM EXPERIENCING MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS EXPRESSED HERE AND AM GOING BACK TO PLAIN OLD CREST.  RINSING MY MOUTH DID NOT GET RID OF THE STRINGY MUCOSA AND I USED MY FINGERS TO REMOVE WHAT I COULD.  DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL I CHECKED WITH THIS WEB SITE.  I NOTICE SOME FOLKS RATE THIS PRODUCT WITH 5 STARS.  PERHAPS THEY HAVE MORE RESISTANCE THAN I DO.</li>
            <li> I am guessing that Crest has transitioned their product line into Pro-Health.  I usually used Crest Clean Mint.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelf at Wal-Mart I figured the Pro-Health Clean Mint would be the same.  The first time I used it my gag reflex kicked in...need I say more on that.  I tried it again another day and experienced the same scenario.  So, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  I don&#x27;t what is causing the reaction but I&#x27;m not going to use the product again.</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health for several years with out a problem.  Then, I got a weird spot on my tongue several months ago.  The spot was smooth, like my taste buds were gone.  It didn&#x27;t hurt, so I ignored it.  I went to the dentist last week and he diagnosed me with a condition called Geographic Tongue.  He also asked what type of toothpaste I used.  When I told him, he wasn&#x27;t surprised.  He recommended that I stop using Prohealth immediately, and said my tongue condition would probably improve.  He was right!  After 3 days of using a different toothpaste, my tongue condition is gone!  The dentist said he used to give it out in the office, but about 20% of patients experienced problems after using it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite of Crest&#x27;s toothpaste because the mint flavor has a strangely granular texture that I could&#x27;nt quite get used to when I brushed. However, the quality of the Crest products remains intact as it was still effective against tooth plaque build-up. Only mildly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have always been meticulous when it came to keeping my teeth clean.  However, I ended up with some periodontal issues a couple of years ago, and the cause was thought to be hormonal in nature.  After having scaling, cleaning, and some additional gum procedures, I went above and beyond what I was already doing, to preserve the health of my teeth and gums.  I started using Crest Pro-Health and didn&#x27;t really have any issues until about 6 weeks ago.  It claims to fight plaque and gingivitis, so I thought this would be the perfect toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums became extremely sensitive and started to ache and burn.  I then noticed a mild soreness in my throat and even in my nasal passages...which I thought was really strange.  I blamed the throat and sinus issues on the dryness in the house.  But couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on with my gums.  They even developed some minor bleeding issues again.  So, I brushed and flossed more often and switched to Crest Pro-Health alcohol free mouthwash also.  And, my problems continued.  My lips were even starting to peel and burn by this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued trying different things until it dawned on me the other day that the Pro-Health may be the culprit.  I immediately switched to Sensodyne toothpaste and my symptoms improved by about 50% within 2-3 days.  Lo and behold, I looked online this evening, and I have literally found hundreds of complaints against this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an appointment coming up with my Periodontist to assess the situation.  But, save yourself any problems and stay away from Crest Pro-Health products.  Their products should be taken off of the market!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.  It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Also allergic!  Argh!  I only used a trial from my dentist because I ran out of my usual Sensodyne and was in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE!!!! I have been using this toothpaste for abot 3 weeks or so now and I was wondering why the skin inside my bottom lip was peeling off. Like everyone has said, it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it is very uncomfortable especially when I try to put on lipstick or lip balm. It does however, leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean but those white strings of skin cells are just disgusting!!! I&#x27;m switching back to my old toothpaste in the morning. This is ridiculous. I DO NOT recommend this toothpaste!!!!</li>
            <li> I made an appointment with my dentist because I was sure something terrible was going on with my teeth. I had horrible, HORRIBLE sensitivity, my gums tingled and felt like they were on fire, and I had a constant metallic taste in my mouth. I thought it was stress, hormones, cavities.... I never even considered that it could be my new toothpaste, which I used for about 2 weeks. My dentist told me to use Sensodyne, which I did, religiously, and the sensitivity and pain abated. I ran out of Sensodyne the day before yesterday and used the Crest toothpaste once. ONCE. Instant sensitivity, metallic taste, and weird sensations in my mouth. I was completely gobsmacked. I came onto Amazon to read the reviews and was horrified to see how many people had a similar experience. This toothpaste is TOXIC and CAUSTIC. It should not be sold to anyone, ever. The military should drop it over the territories of enemy forces, as this stuff is chemical warfare. I don&#x27;t know how Crest continues to sell this nightmarish stuff. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Heath toothpaste for years, since soon after it came out, and I have never noticed any sort of white slime or other issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did notice was that a day after I switched to it, my sensitive teeth were no longer sensitive - this after months of no results from &amp;#34;sensitive-tooth&amp;#34; toothpastes containing the active ingredient potassium nitrate (like Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health ever since.  I&#x27;ve noticed no problems - no slime, no staining - just a really clean-feeling mouth.  The whitening version does have a nasty aftertaste, which &amp;#34;clean mint&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to have.</li>
            <li> I have a different reason, I hate the cap.  I won&#x27;t buy any toothpaste with this cap. I also started to notice brown spots. Now I know where they come from!!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL; QUALITY 95%...</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste and, much like the other critical reviews here, it burnt my mouth out. It feels like I took piping hot pizza fresh from the oven and rubbed it all over my lips and gums. I can&#x27;t whistle anymore because my mouth is so dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s something to consider; I tried another toothpaste from Sensodyne after having used Tom&#x27;s to let my gums heal. After about a day and a half it burnt my mouth out as well! I looked at the back and the Sensodyne had the same active ingredient as the Crest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stannous Fluoride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be the problem. Has anyone else tried a different toothpaste with that active ingredient? I&#x27;d be interested to hear if there are others out there making the connections that I am. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it! I love ordering our toiletries from Amazon and this is one that I order most frequently. My husband and I always use this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing that Crest is sorry to see that some of us have had a horrible experience with their products, but the real issue here is that your product is hurting people. I used Pro Health Soothing Mint toothpaste for about three months. In the beginning it didn&#x27;t bother me all that much but now it actually causes me physical pain to use the product. I brush twice a day and use mouthwash twice a day. Sorry, but your stannous flouride isn&#x27;t worth the physical discomfort and disgust I feel when the inside of my mouth starts peeling off. I&#x27;m not sure what portion of your product it is that causes this reaction, but I&#x27;m not interested in talking to you about it or even hearing how sorry you are. I switched to another product and am unlikely to ever buy another Crest product. Not even a toothbrush. Please do something about this product. It may be &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not pleasant or comfortable to use. There are other products that will protect against plaque that won&#x27;t make it look like we&#x27;ve somehow contracted a yeast infection in our mouths.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste sometime ago and after a few days I woke in the morning with the feeling that my throat was swelling shut.  The only thing different was the toothpaste.  I quit using it and it went away.  I purchased it again by mistake.  I just used it for the first time and suddenly realized what I did.  It was about 5:30pm and it is now 9:30pm my throat is still sore.  I can actually feel it into my nasal passages.  When I was brushing my teeth my throat felt like it was on fire.  Nothing would calm it down.  My husband could not  figure out why I was crying and it hurt so bad I could barely talk.  It is totally with as many complaints as I have read about this product why the FDA has not removed it from the market.  It should be recalled immediately!!!!  I am hoping my throat is better in the morning.  Please do the absolute right thing and get this crap out of all stores everywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> Twice in the past six months, I&#x27;ve experienced a terrible reaction (I believe from Crest Toothpaste) all over and around my lips. Initially, the corners of my lips just cracked, then I developed small bumps and blisters which seeped. The color (pigment) of my lips changed dramatically, appearing much darker and almost blueish/vein-like. The skin aligning my lips also became irritated, burning, chafed and pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last experience has lasted over 5 weeks. It gets so bad, that almost anything that comes in contact w/ my lips burns them horribly. Finally getting into a dermatologist tomorrow. For the past 3 days, I finally switched to Tom&#x27;s natural toothpaste and the irritation seems to be disappearing. While shopping at a pharmacy recently, I encountered yet another person who believed Crest caused her lips to be badly blistered, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been monitoring everything I ate/drank, put on my face, lips, etc. and this is the only variable (toothpaste ingredient) that makes sense. I even threw out many lipsticks, etc. It has been a costly, uncomfortable ordeal. If there is a class action - count me in!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it&#x27;s CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on Crest! It&#x27;s ok to continue to sell a product that you know is SHREDDING people from the inside out? I&#x27;m DONE with Crest products! Sounds like class action lawsuit time to me!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to pin  point what was causing my lips to peel and to become very sensitive to lipsticks and glosses that I have used for years.  It is definitely this toothpaste, because the problem started when I switched to this toothpaste. My daughter has been using the toothpaste as well and has a cherry red outline of her lips at times.  We have both been using aquaphor to heal our lips.  This paste is going in the garbage immediately!!</li>
            <li> Just as many others have shared, I too experienced the issues w/ skin shedding or sloughing off the inside of my mouth.  While researching the symptoms, I ran across many discussion threads on the same issue - people were citing the same symptoms I had been experiencing and linking the symptoms to Crest Pro Health. Last night I brushed w/ a different toothpaste and, for the 1st time in months, had no skin sloughing after. The onset of the symptoms corresponded w/ my having started using Crest Pro Health some months ago.  I had been using Sensodyne but, in an attempt to cut costs, had switched to Crest Pro Health. This is not a new issue. So far I&#x27;ve discovered posts and discussion on this issue dating back to 2007. Ergo, this has been a known issue for a minimum of 3 years. No doubt the makers of Crest Pro Health (Proctor &amp; Gamble) are fully aware of the adverse reactions consumers are experiencing w/ this product.</li>
            <li> My mouth actually felt DIRTIER AFTER brushing than before. Its like brushing your teeth with a grainy fake sugary substance. This is the nastiest toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It CAUSED PAIN in my mouth, teeth and gums. IT&#x27;s gritty and sandy and way to abrasive. I&#x27;ll stick with my colgate total clean mint, thanks but no thanks crest. Gross.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used this product, within 15-20 minutes I noticed a slimy white film in my mouth.  I used a tissue to keep removing,  at first I thought that maybe this toothpaste was removing bacteria but when my mouth and inside my lips  started becoming raw I determined there was something really wrong with the Crest Pro-health toothpaste.  When I went online to see if anyone else had similar issues I couldn&#x27;t believe how many people suffered from this product.  The company should recall this product from the market.</li>
            <li> My husband and I also experience the peeling of the inside of my cheeks. It was really gross. Small sheets of skin would peel off. What could possibly be in this tooth paste to cause your mouth to peel? I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the toothpaste itself, but unless you make sure the cap is all the way on, (which my boyfriend never does) your bathroom sink will be COVERED in toothpaste soon!  It&#x27;s too runny I guess and it just oozes out of the cap until there is nothing left.  I thought maybe it was a defective one, but I bought it in a 2-pack and the second tube was the same exact way.  Between the 2 tubes of toothpaste I probably used a quarter of one of them, and the rest ended up all over my counter.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health uses stannous flouride, which is a superior dental agent but which was replaced in mass market toothpastes by sodium flouride because the latter had a longer shelf life and lowered manufacturing costs.  I enjoy the taste and have had a great experience using the product since it debuted.    As for the complaints and one-star reviews, I have never had anything like those issues.  I brush and floss daily and go to the dentist.  Based on what I&#x27;ve read the complaints seem more common with a Pro Health mouth rinse products, and are the result of dead germs and skin in the mouth.  So this product may be less than ideal if your dental hygiene is less than ideal, but I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003XDVER4 Crest Pro-health Clinical Gum Protection Clean Mint Toothpaste, 4-Ounce (Pack of 3)]]I HAD THOUGHT THAT FLORIDE TOOTHPASTE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MY TEETH BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I HAD WHITE STRINGY SKIN COMING OFF THE INSIDES OF MY MOUTH                                                                                                                             AS WELL AS I DEVELOPED RED BUMPS &amp; BURNING ON INSIDES OF MY LIPS...I DONT GET WHAT INGREDIENT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM.  WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY RETURNED MY MONEY PROMPTLY BUT SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD ANY PRIOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM..THEY OF COURSE ADVISED TO CEASE USING THE PRODUCT...MY MOUTH WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOING BACK TO MY OLD TOOTHPASTE...WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ISSUE?</li>
            <li> Always make sure to read the back of the box of anything before you purchase. \\&quot;May Stain Teeth\\&quot;. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if possible. Burned my mouth its so &#x27;hot&#x27;. Secondly? I&#x27;ve noticed gum line stains on teeth I&#x27;ve never had before &amp; I&#x27;m 51 yrs old. Switched back to Crest w baking soda my old friend. Stains disappearing &amp; no burning.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health line for little over a year and didn&#x27;t make the connection between bad, dark teeth staining on lower front teeth to Crest Pro-Health until this week. I had a my professional dental cleaning and check-up a week ago. My stains were horribly dark blackish color. After dental cleaning, teeth went 3 shades whiter and back to normal looking. A week later after my dental cleaning, my lower teeth stained so fast as if I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth for a year.  I knew something was wrong, until I read the fine print warning on Pro-Heath line and the negative reviews on Amazon. It is important for people to call Crest and let them know that this product is poorly formulated. A tooth paste should not have so many side-effects. It is not acceptable that a toothpaste stains teeth a week after your expensive dental cleaning! I can&#x27;t believe the ADA endorsed this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in the Crest Pro Health Series for treating sensitive teeth is different than the active ingredient in Sensodyne. My husband and I have been using Sensodyne for years but he always had lingering sensitivity issues. I picked up two tubes of this on a whim during a errand shopping trip during my lunch hour. My husband was reluctant to change brands, but after a tube of the Crest Pro Health, he asked me to buy more not knowing there was another tube under the sink. I asked if I should pick up more Sensodyne, and he said no, the Pro Health worked and was totally controlling his sensitivity. I get the same effects from both of the active ingredients so I can use either brand. But because Pro Health is working better for my husband, we&#x27;ve switched over. So if Sensodyne isn&#x27;t working for you, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I only used Crest Pro Health for about 3-4 days when I woke up and noticed a funky coating on my tongue. I had just been getting over a cold so I thought it might have to do with the cold I had. Then my gums became bright red and irritated, my tongue was swollen and numb and the inside of my cheek was inflamed, swollen and irratated. My inside skin of my cheeks and lips felt so swollen and when I tried to drink or eat my mouth was burning. I went to urgent care because the pain was so uncomfortable. I still didn&#x27;t realize what had caused this and thought I had an infection from my cold. My ears and sinuses were still draining so the doctor thought it could have something to do with my sinus infection. He prescribed amoxicillan but I stopped using the toothpaste too and this morning it is still very sore but I think it feels better. I also have dry mouth that no amount of water seems to cure and bad breath. I decided to google the crest pro health when I got home from the doctors because that is the only thing I had done differently since I started having the symptoms and now I know it was the toothpaste. Do not use this product!</li>
            <li> Stannous fluoride in this product can stain your teeth yellow -- even with the \\&quot;whitening agent.  Go for the sodium fluoride in another paste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste needs to be avoided. The front part of my tongue has become all tingly and numb to taste. The tingle sensation is similar to tasting a corrosive metal if that makes any sense. My lips also have started to tingle and chap. I have never had such a negative experience with toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> Bought this last night without being aware of its reputation and brushed with it for the first time this morning. By the time I get out of the shower, I wipe my face and notice &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; on my towel from my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then drive off to get some gas before work, and by the time I arrive at the station 5 minutes from my apartment, my mouth is full of slimy, dead skin. I&#x27;m spitting it up, swallowing it, and wondering if this will last all day. Somewhat unpleasant as you can imagine (or relate, if you&#x27;ve used this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it didn&#x27;t last very long. By the time I got to work, my mouth felt normal again, but people should definitely be aware of this bizarre side effect from using this particular toothpaste. I&#x27;m going to by a tube of something else before brushing again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is super abrasive!!  In addition to brushing my teeth with toothpaste, I occasionally use it polish the hesalite crystal on my watch.  Other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used leaves a smooth finish.  However, this toothpaste leaves a bunch of small visible scratches.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s doing to the enamel on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife dislikes it because it burns her gums as most people reported.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be reviewing a toothpaste on Amazon, but here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a four-pack of this toothpaste sight unseen at a local membership superstore, not knowing anything about its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it, and noticed a number of things right away. First off, it isn&#x27;t as pasty as your typical toothpaste. It feels heavier than regular toothpaste, and it oozes slightly out of the tube, like I need to keep the top upright or else it&#x27;s going to pour out. That was a little weird. It also makes the tip of my tongue tingle as I&#x27;m brushing, and it lingers for a while afterward. That was weird, too. It doesn&#x27;t taste very minty, either. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t taste good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worst of all, when I&#x27;m done brushing and rinsing (and I rinse well), it leaves a terrible, chemical aftertaste in the mouth that lingers for hours. And that isn&#x27;t weird, that&#x27;s unpleasant. I get a strong craving for a sweet drink sometime after brushing with this toothpaste, and that isn&#x27;t at all the kind of thing I should be thinking about after brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got to the point where I was wondering if something was wrong, and I checked the reviews here on Amazon. It was good to discover I was not alone with my misgivings. A lot of the reviews mention stannous fluoride.  I never even knew there was such a thing as stannous fluoride. I thought fluoride was fluoride. So I learned more about it, and I&#x27;m convinced that stannous fluoride is the future of toothpaste fluoride. I was ready to pitch this toothpaste in the trash and move back to my old Crest Tartar Control toothpaste, but I can&#x27;t discount the advantages of stannous fluoride (which is also, apparently, prevalent in mouthwashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I can say about this toothpaste is that it probably leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. My mouth does have a palpably clean feeling after using it, and that is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will bear down and keep using it, albeit grudgingly. The bad aftertaste is its major weakness. I will never love this toothpaste until it tastes as pleasant and clean as the gel toothpastes I know and love. Crest had better improve it in a hurry, or else the drawbacks of this product will wear me down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and had a worst feeling after brushing in the morning. It is thick and feels like it has lot of sand. I cannot describe it verbally, but you dont get that Ah feeling after brushing. I thought maybe I am the only am the only one feeling it, till I read other reviews. I do like Crest brands, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough to suffer any of the other consequences mentioned.  I googled simply because I was curious if others felt the way I did about this product.  It appears they do.  Beyond all the other potential problems it has, this toothpaste tastes so bad, I used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Have used this toothpaste for years.....</li>
            <li> I was a total advocate for this product. The reason is that I listened to my hygenist and they were strong advoates for it.  Of course the cycnic in me was that Crest had them in their backpocket so they&#x27;d tout anything that pays.  But for about 4 months I started to notice staining near where the bone met the gum line.  I thought it was related to me starting to drink tea but reading around, green tea is actually good for you (arguably) and does NOT stain teeth.  I thought maybe it was my gums bleeding, but blood doesn&#x27;t stain unless it&#x27;s dry...so I called my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also add I purchased a WaterPik during that four month span.  I thought it was that product.  Probably the water jets stripping away at the tooth causing it to expose underneath the enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They got me in quicker than I would&#x27;ve liked to see them typically, but this was a bit of an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; for me.  After some discussion, they asked what rinses, toothpastes, apparatuses I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told the the following - in the last four months, I&#x27;ve:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Used Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;- Used Crest Pro-Health rinse&lt;br /&gt;- Purchased and used the WaterPik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a complete 180 from her advice the last time I saw her.  She told me it was the Crest Pro-Health line causing the staining.  I also had what felt like film stripping off.  To the point where I needed to take my finger and pick it off my side of my lips.  So, in a way, it was a relief it was product and not health related.  They are also a Crest advocate still, just not the Pro-Health.  I asked why the Pro-Health in particular?  They say the stannous flouride was causing these effects.  They have received complaints of sore gums and molars as a result of using stannous flouride filled toothpastes - which the Pro-Health has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My visit was a bit longer as they had to scrape and polish off the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, today, I will no longer be using the remaining two tubes I have leftfrom this purchase.  I remain loyal to the brand, but will no longer be using this line.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 years and it works great.  Great gum report from dentist and no cavities!!!</li>
            <li> Skin shed. Brush with this and guarenteed the skin from your cheeks, lips and tongue will shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google it. No one can answer why but thousands know it to be so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> I liked this stuff.  I received it for free to try and I thought it was good.  I would use it like I would my other toothpaste.  I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to it.  It tasted ok, and it cleaned my teeth.  It however isn&#x27;t my favorite toothpaste! But I would use it again if it were on sale and I needed something to use.  All in all just toothpaste, nothing really special about it.  I would say it may be a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I had been using this toothpaste for the past month and noticed that each time after brushing my teeth, the skin inside my mouth would start to peel off. I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening. I used a different toothpaste while visiting my parents and immediately the peeling stopped. I just did a little internet  research and it looks like tons of people have at the same problem with this product. TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this exact toothpaste and just happened to see the terrible reviews for it. From reading a few recent ones, it sounds like crest is sending us flesh-eating fiberglass laced meth toothpaste. Some of the reviews sound horrible, and I&#x27;m truly sorry for those that are experiencing any symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether I have unique anti-fiberglass chemicals in my mouth, or if I&#x27;m immune to all pain, but I actually like this toothpaste quite a bit. My requirements for toothpaste aren&#x27;t that tough: doesn&#x27;t brush away enamel, leaves me feeling clean, tastes good, safe and good value. This toothpaste checks all those boxes, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that if this multibillion dollar global brand of toothpaste caused everyone&#x27;s mouth to rot away, the folks at P&amp;G would have soiled their pants and recalled it day one. It would be in their best interest to do so.</li>
            <li> For months I couldn&#x27;t figure out why the skin was peeling off in my mouth. I even asked my dentist and she couldn&#x27;t figure it out. After reading other Amazon reviews about this product, I realized it was the toothpaste and stopped using it and now my mouth is free of clumps of dead skin! This product needs to be recalled.</li>
            <li> 6 months of using this product: I have multiple wear spots and dark brown stains on my teeth at the gumline, plus 2 enamel colored fillings are now yellow-beige. The inside of my mouth and the tip of my tongue feel burned and that slimely goo that developed within a half hour of brushing was the inside of my mouth peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;I saw my dentist today and within 2 minutes of me starting to list my dental concerns, she asked me if I used Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, and if I did, stop immediately, explaining the damage done. She was able to remove the stains, the wear spots haven&#x27;t breached the enamel (I made be able to rebuild it with proper care) but my fillings are permenantly stained. Time should reverse the mouth pain.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped at the drugstore on the way home, picked up 2 tubes of the toothpaste she recommended and threw out the Crest Pro Health when I got home. I&#x27;m hoping that this product hasn&#x27;t caused any irreversible damage. I&#x27;ve done some research online and it appears that there are several more serious side effects reported, with skin peeling off the inside of your mouth being number one complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t merely not buy this product; avoid it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dental Hygiene student. After presentation done by P&amp;G rep I purchased the paste. I got dry mouth and burning tongue within 5-10 days. It is subjective opinion, but benefits of the paste does not outweigh harm it did. The active ingredient of the toothpaste (stannous fluoride) is no doubt beneficial, however P&amp;G should do something about the side effects. At least inform buyers about it.</li>
            <li> CREST PRO-HEALTH CLINICAL GUM PROTECTION TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH Do some research before you use it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a statement of concern about CREST PRO-HEALTH CLINICAL GUM PROTECTION TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH.  I have always had healthy gums and teeth and have always taken pride in my smile and the health of my mouth.  Because I am over 60, I want to do everything possible to protect my gums and teeth.  About 8 months ago, I looked at various dental products (toothpastes and mouth washes) and decided to try these products, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste and the Pro-Health Mouthwash. I started using these products about eight months ago.  I had a dental check-up about three months after starting to using these products.  Instead of my regular dentist say, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you are doing, but keep it up which has always been his comment after examining my mouth and teeth, to &#x27;Hmmmmmm\\&quot;.  My gums surrounding my lower front teeth were starting to pull away from my gum line.  And, as reported by my dental hygienist, there was a build up of dental calculus that I have not had before.  I was shocked and I got really worried.  I told my dentist that I had this metallic taste in my mouth and that my gums and teeth feel sensitive.  I asked him what the problem was and what was causing it and he said he wasn&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some, but not all of what I experienced; loss of taste and smell (to some degree), white filmy slime all over the inside of my mouth that comes out in strings about ten minutes after brushing in the morning and at night, a metallic taste in my mouth, discoloring of my teeth, gums pulling away from teeth, sensitivity of my mouth, blisters on the roof of my mouth, a chalky white tongue that I could not get back to normal, even after brushing it.  Not knowing what was going on, I continued to use the Crest Products.  But, I tried to figure out what could be causing my mouth problems.  I am in good health, so it is nothealth related. I brush at least twice daily and floss every day, just as I always have. I went online and keyed in, What is that slimy white stuff that I get in my mouth after brushing my teeth?  I was shocked to find that hundreds, if not thousands, of consumers using CREST PRODUCTS have experience the same symptoms!  I was relieved to find that I wasn&#x27;t alone, that many other people have experienced the same thing.  But, I was disgusted to learn that a reputable dental company, CRESTby Proctor and Gamble, was responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using these dental care products.  As soon as my mouth heals, I will go in for my semi-annual dental visit and cleaning and talk to my dentist about what I found in my online research. I am not sure how I am going to rectify the damage caused by your products, but it is going to have to be rectified.  In the meantime, I hope Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste and Mouthwash are pulled off the store shelves.</li>
            <li> This is a toothpaste with a lot of claims, but the one I was hoping for was helping with sensitivity.  Perhaps, but even on the tube it says\\&quot; \\&quot;Do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.\\&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t say like my Sensodyne to see the dentist if the problem persists for four weeks.  Nonetheless, my dentist has handed me out samples of Crest and the toothpaste has proven to be a good one.  Just don&#x27;t count on it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn&#x27;t.  The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn&#x27;t listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one that left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier mint taste than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest, but quite nice.  If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  I do appreciate products that aren&#x27;t set to expire a month after purchase.  Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don&#x27;t need or want large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights cavities&lt;br /&gt;~  Whitens teeth&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights gingivitis&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights tartar&lt;br /&gt;~  Freshens breath&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights plaque&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stannous floride 0.454% (0.16 w/v fluoride ion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, hydrated silica, sodium hexametaphosphate, proplene glycol, PEG-6, water, zinc lactate, trisodium phosphate, flavor, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium gluconate, carrageenan, sodium saccharin, polyethylene, xanthan gum, titanium dioxide, blue 1</li>
            <li> This is a great all around toothpaste. The minty flavor is okay. It is good for those with sensitive teeth, and it also has whitening properties.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the problems that some of the other reviewers have complained about. This toothpaste worked well for me and gave me no side effects.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste looking for something new. Little did I know it was gonna eat up the inside of my lips and checks. I can&#x27;t taste my food any more:(  it&#x27;s also eating up my gums. I used two tubes, I kept ruling the toothpaste out as my husband hasn&#x27;t had a problem. After reading the reviews I realized I don&#x27;t have thrush! I just need to stop using crest pro health!! I&#x27;ll go back to my toms tooth paste!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a strong, a bit sweet flavor. I like this one- it really refreshens my breath and keeps the clean feeling for long. I used the Crest Scoop Whitening and the taste wasn&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;The paste is gritty. I didn&#x27;t experience any peeling in my mouth too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since my dentist gave me a sample. This has been a great product for me. I have sensitivity and dry mouth. This reduces sensitivity without causing irritation. The flavor is fine. The texture is pretty gritty but I actually like that in a toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read these reviews and I see that some people have had trouble with it. I am really surprised. This has been great for me and does not exacerbate dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth and gums, so I tend to be careful which toothpaste I use.  However, I&#x27;m a Crest user from way back and was looking forward to trying this.  Well, the toothpaste was fabulous.  It was gentle on my teeth and gums, while still cleaning beautifully.  My teeth look white and strong and the scent is attractive.  Now, I don&#x27;t drink much coffee, tea or other drinks like that, so I can&#x27;t speak to the stain-fighting power.  I can only say that, when I use this toothpaste, my teeth look very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> If this gave me the option to give it zero stars I would. This product is absolutely terrible! Not only did I get that nasty slime, but eventually it left my lower lip completely raw and very swollen and the underside of my tongue is a bit swollen as well, which is posing a problem because it keeps getting caught in my permanent retainer. I actually cannot use toothpaste currently, it hurts that bad and needs to heal. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I also got skin or something that would peel off from the inside of my mouth. It stopped happening when I stopped using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Crest toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve never had anything like the texture of this.  It was runny and got all over my clothes and towels.  I finally gave up and threw it away.  I bought another brand and it&#x27;s fine.  I ordered 4 tubes of the Crest and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the remaining.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it didn&#x27;t contain some of the chemicals other toothpastes do. I was almost put off by the comments about it turning teeth brown, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasant to use and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see the glowing reviews this toothpaste is receiving.  I just came back from the dentist and the hygienist asked why my teeth were stained.  I told her we had switched to Crest pro-health toothpaste. She immediately knew that was the problem.  She had trouble removing the stains, especially near the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet and found many warnings about the staining problem, mostly with the mouthwash, but also from the toothpaste.  I have never used the pro-health mouthwash. There are also reports of mouth ulcers and loss of taste due to use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a warning on the label that the active ingredient, Stannous fluoride, may stain the teeth. I never thought it would stain so badly.  I&#x27;m surprised that the FDA hasn&#x27;t gotten involved in this.  Crest seems to be turning a blind eye.</li>
            <li> I have been using various Crest products for many years and appreciated being offered a sample of the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I am not a dentist, I am a consumer, and I can only report from my side of the equation. This tastes fresh and minty. It leaves my mouth feeling clean. In other words, it does everything I expect a toothpaste to do. Best of all, it helps with my sensitivity - something I have developed as I grow older. Unlike other sensitivity toothpastes, this one actually doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel funny afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I noticed is that you are only supposed to use this for four weeks unless you have your dentist&#x27;s permission to continue using it. So keep it as a \\&quot;heads up\\&quot; if you are considering this, especially since it comes in a pack of 4. Suggest unless you have your dentist&#x27;s thumbs up in advance, you purchase this in a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest toothpaste for as long as I can remember. Sure, I&#x27;ve tried other brands occasionally, but always returned to Crest as soon as the competing brand&#x27;s tube was finished. I have found Crest toothpaste to be both effective and pleasant-tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste, it seemed a no-brainer to upgrade to this newest Crest formula. Promoted by Crest as providing six different benefits: cavities, gingivitis, plaque, whitening, sensitivity, and bad breath, I couldn&#x27;t imagine where this toothpaste would go wrong, given my past experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this toothpaste goes wrong is in the flavor. While I can force myself to brush with it, the taste is decidedly unpleasant to me. I can&#x27;t quite describe what is wrong other than to say it is somewhat reminiscent of the flavors one experiences during a trip to the dentist. Perhaps the \\&quot;Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride\\&quot; in it is just too strong for me or maybe it is the \\&quot;Sodium Hexametaphospahte\\&quot; I find unpalatable. I really don&#x27;t know and I don&#x27;t care. I do know I won&#x27;t be using this toothpaste anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the flavor, this toothpaste really does clean well, but that flavor is such a huge turn-off for me that I won&#x27;t be able to use it long enough to determine the long-term effectiveness of this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to [[ASIN:B005PLQIQ4 Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste - Minty Fresh Triple Pack 18.6 Oz]], which is pleasant enough that I look forward to brushing my teeth. Perhaps the Pro-Health formula might taste OK to others, but it doesn&#x27;t suit me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I did not experience any issues with lip peeling or sores, etc. but only used it a couple of days because of the bad taste.</li>
            <li> Crest has come a long way. I was always a Colgate fan, however, two years ago I started trying out Crest&#x27;s Pro Health products (mainly because of a CVS promotion). I am honestly impressed by the quality of the toothpaste. My teeth feel clean without any residue. The mint is crisp without being overpowering or any yucky aftertaste. It is a bit pricier, but I consider it an investment. I combine this toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health  [[ASIN:B005PLQGUC Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack 8 Oz]]for night time brushes and am going two years cavity free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with sensitivity in my mouth, but this toothpaste is designed to help with sensitive teeth and gums as well as doing all the other things I brush my teeth for: whitening, killing germs, fighting plaque and freshening breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much to say about this toothpaste other than I don&#x27;t mind the flavor, and it leaves my mouth tasting and feeling clean. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest toothpaste, along with Sonicare toothbrushes, and the combination has left me with healthy teeth and gums into my \\&quot;golden years.\\&quot; This one seems OK, perfectly acceptable taste and texture, though I will be watching out for potential staining. The package info., while warning about possible staining, states that it is removable by a dentist. That may be reassuring, but it does seem a little ironic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started out using Crest there was Crest toothpaste, then gel was introduced, then tartar protection (the one I&#x27;ve been using for years).Today I counted twenty six different Crest formulas and flavors, about one each for every tooth I have in my head!  Probably too late for me to try all of them, but I wish someone would.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and how it makes my mouth feel after brushing but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave it four stars because it seems to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box states under \\&quot;Other information\\&quot;  that \\&quot;products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\\&quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  The box then states \\&quot;this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\\&quot;  This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars.</li>
            <li> I had no idea of the cause but when I googled peeling skin I came across several people and one common thread...this toothpaste.  Really horrible stuff.</li>
            <li> I got away from crest for sometime, but now I am a faithful customer of pro health toothpast.  my dentist recommended it and will stay a customer of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this toothpaste for a couple of days. So I can&#x27;t speak to the side effects that other people have mentioned, but I can say this, this is the worst tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, and that includes the whitening stuff that doesn&#x27;t even try to taste good. It&#x27;s so disgusting that I almost start to gag when I put it in my mouth. I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; is supposed to refer to, because it&#x27;s not the taste. Pass.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product. I bought my own and started with bleeding of my gums.  I thought that&#x27;ll stop after a while, but it just got worse.  I started to notice my inner mouth felt funny afterwards, like the walls of my mouth sticking my teeth.  I finally asked my boyfriend if he ever felt these symptoms, but he never did. After looking online, I found out the sticky feeling inside my mouth was from the inner skin peeling and sticking to my teeth.  I have noticed my lips were much more chapped than before. I discontinued the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know what ingredient is doing this? I would like to avoid it next time.  For now, I&#x27;ll go back to my previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I just bought this Crest Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection today and upon my first use after rinsing out with water my mouth was noticeably somewhere between dry and foamy. I ignored it thinking this was suppose to happen and that I&#x27;d get used to it but no more than 30 minutes later I&#x27;m pulling the stringy white slime out of my mouth.  I checked my mouth in the mirror and see that my gums and cheeks look as if they&#x27;re pealing off creating this white stringy slime. I immediately looked this up online and see that so many people are having the same experience. I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. Immediately discontinuing use! I highly recommend trashing this product.  Thank you Crest for the scare!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste...what&#x27;s not to like?  We use this kind/brand and normally buy it at Costco; however, we needed &amp;#34;cart filler&amp;#34; and bought this (and subsequently put it in a white elephant gift exchange...)</li>
            <li> Is this dissolving the skin in my mouth? After using this toothpaste, there is a substantial amount of clumpy mucus in my mouth that i have to spit out. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one experiencing this.</li>
            <li> I had been using Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control for about a week. I immediately started to get an ulcer in my month. At first, I ignored it, and didn&#x27;t connect the two. Then, as the days progressed, I started developing more and more ulcers. I had approximately 5 ulcers in my mouth at once after a week&#x27;s time had passed. The only change I had made was I starting using this toothpaste. I immediately switched to Tom&#x27;s toothpaste (which my dentist recommended &amp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!) and within a few days, my ulcers went away. The Crest team needs to seriously consider recalling this product. The FDA should not allow stannous flouride to be on the market- the active ingredient. I contacted Crest, but have yet to hear a response from them. A product like this should not be on the market. IT IS NOT SAFE FOR YOU FAMILY. The toothpaste is far too abrasive. I will never but another Crest product again. DO NOT USE THIS TOOTHPASTE.</li>
            <li> My go-to toothpaste. Never leaves a bad taste and keeps my mouth feeling fresh. I don&#x27;t like Colgate because of the taste that it leaves.</li>
            <li> Hi, I get the slimy mouth like everybody else who uses this product and I don&#x27;t like it. However, I keep using it because my 6-month check ups have never been better. Hardly any plaque equals &#x3D; hardly any unpleasant scraping at my appointment. My dental hygienist was really impressed and SHE started using this product. I guess my mouth isn&#x27;t quite as sensitive as some others - I don&#x27;t get the peeling interior - and the slime is a drag, but I&#x27;ve kept at it the past 2 years because of the results. It seems to me as if the slime coats the teeth overnight and prevents decay and plaque forming. Icky? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Worth it? For now!</li>
            <li> Great price if you sign up for subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I feel like everyone is not rinsing enough after using this product. I rinse for a good 1-2+ minutes after I finish brushing and brush over my teeth with a wet toothbrush again just to make sure most of the toothpaste is gone and rinse some more to make sure the left over is not sitting around my gums. I did notice some of the issues when I first began using this type of toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 4+ years (rinse thoroughly now) and haven&#x27;t had a complaint since and no cavities. I&#x27;m only reviewing this because I don&#x27;t want them to discontinue the product after seeing so many horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a green, gel-like toothpaste - I say gel-like, because it is like a gel blended with the signature chalky texture of just about every other crest toothpaste. This one comes with stannous fluoride, the one that can temporarily stain, but that is because this is for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dislike of this product is not because I do not have sensitive teeth, but rather because after a good thorough brushing, my teeth do not feel as silky smooth as when I use various other toothpastes. Also, this had that absorbing characteristic of other Crest Pro-Health products that I have tried, and I find its lasting sensation unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive teeth, stannous fluoride toothpastes seem to be the norm. I prefer the flavor of Crest&#x27;s white goop toothpastes better.</li>
            <li> I was almost afraid to open the tube of Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste after reading the reviews here. I did though, and fortunately haven&#x27;t experienced any of the side effects mentioned here. With that being said though, I really do not like this tootpaste. The first thing I do not like is the taste. The only way I can describe it is that it tastes &amp;#34;unpleasant&amp;#34;, and the taste lingers. The toothpaste is also abrasive and like brushing with sand. I will not be using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> Crest has always been my toothpaste of choice. I really like this newish package design; it is nice to be able to stand my toothpaste on the cap so it takes less room on the counter. This flavor is nice, it has a pleasant minty flavor that is not too overpowering. It is more of a gel than a paste, which is something you should keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like gel toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they changed but all of the sudden in the last few months I experienced the same white slimy coating on my teeth and inside my cheeks. Now my lips get extremely dry with white film then the dry mouth took over and is totally miserable. I thought it was just me until I looked it up and saw lots of other people had the same thing happen. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothpaste to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old posting from my mom&#x27;s Amazon account. She has not had any problems with the toothpaste thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;This past Sunday I had just come back from my boyfriend&#x27;s and found that we had new toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It tasted good... nothing wrong... right?&lt;br /&gt;Well this past Monday I thought I had a little canker sore in my mouth on my tongue. Yesterday my tongue and the bottom of my mouth felt worse and today was AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I brushed my teeth early this morning as usual and my mouth was STINGING. I thought it was just the &amp;#34;canker sores&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve been having a lot of citrus fruit, lately. I thought that was what caused it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, I got ready for bed (15 minutes ago) and used the toothpaste and my mouth could NOT take it. Fruit hasn&#x27;t been stinging me when I ate it and neither have my flavored water drinks. I had to spit out the toothpaste because it stung so much. That&#x27;s when I figured out it was the toothpaste causing this swelling and unbelievable soreness in my mouth. I honestly thought I had like five canker sores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up reviews like I&#x27;m writing right now and saw the exact same things that have been happening to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I looked the reviews up. I hope that this review can help somebody else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product needs to be looked at. I thought I was having some sort of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste - it&#x27;s the one that always leaves our mouth the freshest for the longest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were looking for it for a better price than the local supermarkets and pharmacies.  I always have that slight fear of buying things like this online in case it&#x27;s a \\&quot;counterfeit\\&quot; but sure enough, this pack of 4 was exactly what we were looking for.  It&#x27;s authentic, good price, sealed containers, and not expired dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note about Amazon, it also arrived on-time and well-packed.</li>
            <li> This should be negative stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worse than a waste of money!  It is horrific that a company creates a product that should benefit your teeth and it actually damages them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist looked at my teeth today and commented on how badly they are stained.  With no comment from me, she asked if I was using Crest ProHealth.  Apparently most people who use it end up with badly stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly disgusted.  I&#x27;ve contacted Crest for a refund on the two tubes I bought.  I will never use there products again. This is not a trustworthy company.</li>
            <li> I was baffled to come her and find all of the negative reviews.  I have had no experiences like the one-star reviewers while using this product.  It leaves my mouth feeling a lot cleaner and healthier than the normal crest and colgate.  I don&#x27;t know what makes pro-health different than other crest toothpastes, if it has an extra ingredient or a higher concentration of some ingredients, but I rather love it.  I actually find myself being more consistent with regular brushing when I have this stuff about.</li>
            <li> FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FDA after you get your refund.  There is no way for you to believe the pain and distaste in your mouth after using this product.  All Crest Pro Health products will cause the loss of taste buds as well as teeth staining.  It is actually in their FAQs now (after a lawsuit was filed).  But it will remain on the market until enough people complain to the FDA.  Do your part and make your pain known.</li>
            <li> It may slightly defeat the purpose of brushing, but I tend to have hot tea pretty regularly throughout the day and some toothpastes just seem to linger for an hour, even longer and then alter the taste of my tea. This Crest Pro-Health Mint flavor doesn&#x27;t hover on the tongue to create that problem, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I feel like the products cleans well, and appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t tingle overly much because I don&#x27;t need that sensation to feel toothpaste or mouthwash works. So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced an issue with the toothpaste, but I haven&#x27;t yet emptied the tube though I have used it for a sustained period of time. If something changes, I will report back. It is worthwhile to note that I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies.</li>
            <li> Like hydrogen peroxide in mouthwash, some people have significant negative reactions to Stannous Fluoride.  That is the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, so keep that in mind.  For me, it is a good basic toothpaste and I enjoy using it.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, and the minty flavor does not linger and make food taste bad.  It is not amazing and I prefer the version with Scope Outlast, but it is a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> I thought I used all of the Crest brands, but I haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Crest Pro-Health is a nice product.  I used it this morning with my battery-powered Oral B and was amazed at the flavor.  It has a hickory, smoked flavor to it.  It&#x27;s not bad at all but usually I was expecting that blue minty flavor because the gel is blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 minutes with the brush on, my teeth feel really clean.  In this solution the paste has some micro beads in it.  I guess that&#x27;s for friction.  But, it feels noticeably good when the brush head is rotating around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best prescription for good oral hygiene requires a lot more than just toothpaste and brushing at least once a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A tongue scraper&lt;br /&gt;* dental floss&lt;br /&gt;* a battery-powered/ electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;* a reputable toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this Crest Pro-Health is excellent.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste seemed to work okay until a few minutes after I finished when there was just this flat bad taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a soft plastic with a flat lid, which I suppose is meant to let the toothpaste drop to the opening, but that really doesn&#x27;t work. To get the last of the toothpaste out, one has to press the tube together; you cannot roll it up like a normal tube.&lt;br /&gt;This is a toothpaste that might work, but not with that lingering aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I began to suspect today that switching to this toothpaste last week may be the reason for my swollen, irritated lips.  I found these reviews after searching to see if others had any problems.  Wow, I cant believe it.  Now I am sure and Im getting new toothpaste tomorrow.  Disappointed because I hoped this would be a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste has a nice mild flavor that the whole family liked. It seems to clean our teeth like the usual toothpaste. There is nothing unique about this product. It works and tastes good. I prefer Colgate brand for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years. I thought my teeth were stained from tea, but it turns out that the stannous flouride in this stuff is what was doing it-according to my dental hygienist. She cautioned me that while it prevents cavities, it stains the enamel. So, off to find another toothpaste for sensitive teeth that doesn&#x27;t have stannous flouride in it.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint is very much like the Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection except for a few of the chemical ingredients are re-ordered, and the flavor.  While the Gum Protection is fiercely minty, the Clean Mint is mild enough that my son doesn&#x27;t mind the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Chemicals -- one difference is that the order of Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Sulfate in the list of ingredients is reversed.  There are other switches, but given that they are way low on the list I doubt it makes a significant difference in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We won&#x27;t be buying more of this because the many 1-Star reviews seem to indicate that there is a quality control problem with this particular product.</li>
            <li> I just stumbled upon these reviews and I am SO happy I did! I have been having problems with my mouth for a year and a half that have gotten increasingly worse. I&#x27;ve been using Pro Health for three years, so I&#x27;ve never considered that was the issue. I am feeling a combination of relief and frustration right now. Wow! It&#x27;s my toothpaste causing me all of these problems.I have been to two doctors, a dentist, and an oral surgeon. I&#x27;ve had blood work done to check for vitamin deficiencies and diseases, and I&#x27;ve had two biopsies of the inside of my lower lip. Nothing has been found that could cause my problems. I have become so depressed lately because of my sore and swollen mucous membranes in my mouth, lack of taste, dry mouth, and bad breath that I have considered asking my doctor for an antidepressant. This has really been adversely affecting my life. I want to cry right now... out of pure joy at the possibility of getting my mouth and life back to normal by throwing away my Pro Health, as well as out of frustration that Crest knows how this is affecting people and they continue to sell it. I am hoping that no permanent damage had been done to my mouth. As I write this review the inside of my lips are raw, tender, swollen, and sticking to my teeth because they are also dry. I have a bad taste in my mouth. I can&#x27;t wait for this to end. I can&#x27;t wait to kiss my boyfriend again!! I can&#x27;t wait to be able to have a conversion with someone and worry that my breath will offend them! I&#x27;ve always had beautiful teeth, fresh breath, and excellent hygiene. This has been a nightmare!</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s Crest toothpaste, and so, decent toothpaste. The packaging designer should be drawn and quartered, or at least banished to where he can never harm consumers again. Why do you need a giant plastic dongle at the end of the goddamned toothpaste tube? Why does it need a huge cap that doesn&#x27;t even seal the hole where the toothpaste comes out? The plastic dongle makes it difficult to get the paste out; my girlfriend ends up squirting toothpaste all over the place (or else it just leaks out when unattended). The cap makes it impossible to seal the damn thing. Why did they do it? To be \\&quot;modern?\\&quot; Modern people don&#x27;t like the idea of giant plastic things which served no useful purpose in the first place sitting in landfills for the next few thousand years. I&#x27;m no earthy-crunchy type, but I found it wasteful and stupid: and it doesn&#x27;t even work right!&lt;br /&gt;The venerable plastic or foil toothpaste tube works *just fine* -we do not need \\&quot;innovations\\&quot; like this monstrosity.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and the convenience of subscribe and save. Taste great and leaves your teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I was out of toothpaste, so I gave the crest pro-health a try. I used it for about 3 days and the skin in my mouth was peeling away as a gooey slime. I now have the worst canker sore in my mouth and it hurts to talk, let alone brush my teeth. Do not use. You will regret it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal.  That&#x27;s not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you&#x27;ve rinsed with hydrogen peroxide.  The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel, a bit more like a gel than the \\&quot;Invigorating Clean Mint\\&quot;, which is my favorite of these Crest Clinical toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint Toothpaste. It has a fresh flavor that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. There seem to be little gritty things (maybe baking soda) in it which helps serve as an abrasive to more thoroughly cle an my teeth. And I notice that my mouth feels cleaner longer after using it than with the cheap Colgate that I&#x27;ve been using. I think Crest ProHealth won me over with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is a bit watery or runny compared to toothpastes that I&#x27;m used to, so that if the lid isn&#x27;t snapped completely in place, by the morning a bunch of the toothpaste has leaked onto the counter. I just need to be more careful.</li>
            <li> So Crest ProHealth is supposed to do just about everything: fight cavities and plaque, whiten teeth, freshen breath, and help sensitivity. When a toothpaste makes these sorts of claims, I get instantly suspicious, personally. The whitening and plaque/tartar fighting claims are true of regular budget toothpaste, it&#x27;s just marketing doubletalk. Notice that the box copy will always say \\&quot;polishes surface stains.\\&quot; That&#x27;s whitening in a sense I suppose, but not the sense that people take it to be - the type of whitening treatments newscasters and celebrities get. Some rudimentary googling will confirm this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will move on to sensitivity and freshening breath. I think the flavor is pretty good and it does seem reminiscent of toothpastes that feature \\&quot;Scope\\&quot; mouthwash flavor. So if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing, you will find it here. On the other hand, I not only found that this was not a good sensitive mouth toothpaste, but it actually made my teeth feel more sensitive! And this is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth. There is a grittiness to the toothpaste that was unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary of course, but if I were asked to pronounce a verdict, I&#x27;d say just save 50% and buy a regular toothpaste. You&#x27;ll get the same \\&quot;surface polish\\&quot; whitening, and the same dental hygiene elements. The only thing this offers as an extra is the mouthwash flavor, and I think it&#x27;s pretty poor on the sensitivity front.</li>
            <li> Happy with this toothpaste, no ill-effects at all. Despite using it twice a day, I still have my cheeks, gums, tongue, and even my teeth!</li>
            <li> I like it on crackers.</li>
            <li> Very good product, too bad the price went thru the roof after first order</li>
            <li> Crest pro health toothpaste tells me it has ActivClean crystals, which translates into crunchy toothpaste, not the most pleasant way to start the morning. The gel toothpaste has a strong taste which I didn&#x27;t find refreshing or pleasant. Reading the box, Crest is supposed to fight cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar and it whitens and freshens breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to only use Crest pro health for sensitivity for four weeks, after that I guess it stops helping? Then the box says \\&quot;products containing stannous fluoride may cause staining of the teeth.\\&quot; The box continues on to tell me that Crest is specially formulated to prevent staining but if it does go see my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a search on Stannous fluoride, it does strengthen the enamel better than other fluorides. however... many Americans can&#x27;t afford dental care for issues like cavities, let alone blithely run off to get stains removed from their teeth. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste is for sensitive teeth.  It helps fight cavities, gingivitis, tartar and plaque.  It helps whiten your teeth and freshen your breath.  The active ingredient in this toothpaste is stannous fluoride.  To use the toothpaste, apply at least a one inch strip of it on a soft bristled toothbrush (I prefer to wet my brush first) and brush your teeth for at least a minute twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not read the reviews for Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste before I picked it and I have to admit that if I had read the reviews I wouldn&#x27;t have picked it - some of those reviews are scary!  However, I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for a while now and I don&#x27;t find it to be nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers do.  Yes, the toothpaste is a bit thicker than I am used to and is definitely an acquired taste - I find it doesn&#x27;t taste bad when I am brushing my teeth but I&#x27;m not fond of the aftertaste when I spit it out.  The toothpaste does a good job of cleaning my teeth and does seem to be designed for sensitive teeth which my teeth definitely are.  I am a bit nervous that stannous can stain your teeth but I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for quite a while and have yet to notice any staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will like Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste but I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with it.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago I was noticing stringy, fleshy, gooey residue in my mouth. Thought I had some dreaded gum disease! It was as if my gums were melting away.  Thought I had some dreaded gum disease!  I just stumbled onto these reviews and realized I had been using Crest Pro Health at the time. I could never have imagined it was the toothpaste.  INCREDIBLE</li>
