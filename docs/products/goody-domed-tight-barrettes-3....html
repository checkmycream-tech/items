    <ol>
            <li>These barrettes are perfect for my hair.  </li>
            <li>LOL!!!</li>
            <li>These clips work great!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>These are the best barrettes and</li>
            <li>These 3 inch and the 3.25 inch are perfect.  </li>
            <li>All in all a great purchase.</li>
            <li>This 3\\&quot; size is really good</li>
            <li>These are not the most attractive or fancy barrettes in the world.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size and hold my medium thickness hair in place perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I was SO glad to find these!</li>
            <li>These barrettes fit my hair great</li>
            <li>nice size holds lots of hair cant find in stores anymore?</li>
            <li>The assortment of colors is nice, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over for these, and am so glad you sell them.</li>
            <li>Which is actually the best compliment I can give.</li>
            <li>Comfortable!</li>
            <li>&quot; I absolutely LOVE...</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find them for years</li>
            <li>Simple, yet so perfect.</li>
            <li>I suggest you order more than one pack.  </li>
            <li>, they fit my head nicely too and there are no fussy fastener details that could snag my hair.</li>
            <li>Preparing to slap on a shower cap, go for a windy hike, or safely work around</li>
            <li>These barrettes are strong and are not made of that flimsy metal that bends and causes the barrette to slip or fall out as happens with some of Goody&#x27;s 3 inch tortoise shell covered barrettes that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One-piece curved design fits comfortably snug against your scalp or nape.</li>
            <li>But they look just fine, hold your hair firmly, don&#x27;t slip  during the day, hold a lot of hair, are easy to put on and take off, are incredibly durable, and don&#x27;t have moving parts in which your hair gets stuck.</li>
            <li>These barrettes really are perfect for thick hair and are very comfortable to wear too!</li>
            <li>let alone brown in one package especially for this good of a price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making it easy and inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>really worth the money</li>
            <li>Really like !</li>
            <li>First off I appreciate that two brown barrettes come in the package.</li>
            <li>size of the set I received was actually about 3 3/8 inches, which was fine.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the way I can easily twirl my past-the-shoulder length, 3 1/4 inch pony  tail circumference hair, double, or even triple, it up near the top of my head and cinch the doubled or tripled up hair into the barrette.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone who wear ponytails and has very thick hair.</li>
            <li>no worse.</li>
            <li>These do however work very well.</li>
            <li>they fit the back of my head</li>
            <li>The clip itself is its own spring, which holds hair firmly with no need for moving parts or repeated bending -</li>
            <li>They are even good for thick hair, though I also have the thick-hair version, but I like these because they are sleeker.</li>
            <li>and I have used these barrettes since high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find in store, so it was nice to find a pack of 4 for this price.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have found is the finish chips and wears off very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>When I finally went on-line to your website, I found exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had a very difficut time finding what I wanted in local supermarkets.</li>
            <li>(ever since high school) I am an African American woman with &#x27;VERY&#x27; natural (NOT NAPPY) hair.</li>
            <li>No other barrette combination that I saw incorporates two of any color</li>
            <li>Holds hair evenly without sliding or pulling, and there are no sharp pieces to snag or scratch.</li>
            <li>actually this is one I wanted - the 8 package was too small - love the 3&amp;#34; size for my long hair</li>
            <li>I was using the &#x27;SAME&#x27; barrettes my &#x27;ENTIRE&#x27; adult life.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>Those are a lot of positive attributes for everyday barrettes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have really thick hair and these barrettes are large enough to hold it well.</li>

            <li> For Thick hair, nothing can beat these classic barrettes.  </li>
            <li> These barrettes are big enough to hold my entire (rather thick) ponytail, but can also clip just a section of my hair without sliding.</li>
            <li> I just broke my last one a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the color would withstand for several months with heavy usage; however, I would still purchase.</li>

            <li> It also does hold my hair &#x27;tight&#x27; and the barrette NEVER slips or comes off.</li>
            <li> They were a little hard to close with all of my hair in it, but could just be because they are new and need to be broken in.</li>
            <li> I plan to order an extra set for my sister who has very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I wear them everyday.</li>

            <li> These are the ONLY barrettes for thick hair!!</li>
            <li> No better.</li>
            <li> I mean barrettes not the things they sell today that are called barrettes.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and need to pin it up out of my face and up off my neck while cooking or doing housework.</li>

            <li> These barrettes are perfect for my hair.  I&#x27;ve been looking all over for these, and am so glad you sell them.</li>
            <li> These are*exactly* the way I remember them from my younger days. No better. no worse. Which is actually the best compliment I can give.</li>
            <li> These are not the most attractive or fancy barrettes in the world. But they look just fine, hold your hair firmly, don&#x27;t slip  during the day, hold a lot of hair, are easy to put on and take off, are incredibly durable, and don&#x27;t have moving parts in which your hair gets stuck.

            <li> I wear them everyday. They are even good for thick hair, though I also have the thick-hair version, but I like these because they are sleeker.</li>
            <li> Really like ! Comfortable!</li>
            <li> Goody Domed Tight Barrettes 3\\&quot; (VERY HARD TO FIND!!!) I wore these barrettes for &#x27;OVER&#x27; 30 years!!! (ever since high school) I am an African American woman with &#x27;VERY&#x27; natural (NOT NAPPY) hair. LOL!!! I have always just washed my hair and go. My hair is several inches off my shoulder and mid way down my back. This is the &#x27;ONLY&#x27; barrette that will hold &#x27;ALL&#x27; my hair in place. It also does hold my hair &#x27;tight&#x27; and the barrette NEVER slips or comes off. Now that I am approaching the big &#x27;50!!!&#x27; These barrettes even work as an \\&quot;instant face lift!!!\\&quot; I absolutely LOVE... these!!! They last &#x27;FOREVER!!!&#x27; I just broke my last one a few weeks ago. I was using the &#x27;SAME&#x27; barrettes my &#x27;ENTIRE&#x27; adult life. Great for anyone who wear ponytails and has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had a very difficut time finding what I wanted in local supermarkets. When I finally went on-line to your website, I found exactly what I wanted. Thanks so much for making it easy and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These clips work great! I have VERY thick Asian hair and even if I tie my hair very tight with a hair tie it always loosens up after a while. These clips hold my hair in place and does not budge. I would definitely purchase these again. Great product!</li>
            <li> I use these in my hair every day. grateful to have a 3 pack to choose colors from. thank you</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and these barrettes are large enough to hold it well. They were a little hard to close with all of my hair in it, but could just be because they are new and need to be broken in.</li>
            <li> First off I appreciate that two brown barrettes come in the package. No other barrette combination that I saw incorporates two of any color let alone brown in one package especially for this good of a price.  They are just the right size and hold my medium thickness hair in place perfectly.  The construction is all one piece; therefore, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair being pulled out.  I&#x27;ve used them a handful of times; however, the color is starting to peel off.  I don&#x27;t think the color would withstand for several months with heavy usage; however, I would still purchase.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and I have used these barrettes since high school. I have not been able to find them for years and I lost my last one. I was SO glad to find these! These are the ONLY barrettes for thick hair!!</li>
            <li> nice size holds lots of hair cant find in stores anymore?</li>
            <li> These were too short.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Simple, yet so perfect. One-piece curved design fits comfortably snug against your scalp or nape. Holds hair evenly without sliding or pulling, and there are no sharp pieces to snag or scratch. The clip itself is its own spring, which holds hair firmly with no need for moving parts or repeated bending - so they last. So comfy I sometimes even sleep in them.</li>
            <li> actually this is one I wanted - the 8 package was too small - love the 3&amp;#34; size for my long hair</li>
            <li> This style barrette is  the only style that actually holds my hair up. I have very thick hair and need to pin it up out of my face and up off my neck while cooking or doing housework. I have used this style for years and have tried may other brands over the years that either pop open or actually break when I pin up my hair. I&#x27;m still trying to find this style in a slightly larger size. This 3\\&quot; size is really good but I used to have this barrette in a 4\\&quot; or 5\\&quot; size years ago which was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They hold on to your hair and will not let go until you remove them. These barrettes really are perfect for thick hair and are very comfortable to wear too! The only negative I have found is the finish chips and wears off very easily and quickly. I looked at the one I have been wearing around the house and noticed that the paint is missing all over it.  These do however work very well.</li>
            <li> For Thick hair, nothing can beat these classic barrettes.  I could not find them in the stores and looked everywhere, Walmart, Target, CVS, Rite Aid, local mall, even on line- which I found on Amazon.  I should have started there and stopped wasting my time.  These are the best barrettes and I mean barrettes not the things they sell today that are called barrettes.  These 3 inch and the 3.25 inch are perfect.  I suggest you order more than one pack.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in store, so it was nice to find a pack of 4 for this price. These barrettes are big enough to hold my entire (rather thick) ponytail, but can also clip just a section of my hair without sliding. The assortment of colors is nice, too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> they fit the back of my head and i can still lie back on a pillow without getting stabbed in the head. (i like that)i wear my hair up alot and get those strands of hair that slip out of the pony tail.  these barrettes keep them under control. i got two packs of them so i have two of each color. (i use two at a time)  really worth the money and i could not find them anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Sturdy barrettes that will hold thick hair securely are hard to come by.  These definitely do the trick!  They are everything I dreamed of as I searched far and wide in local stores looking for a replacement for ones I had lost in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the set I received was actually about 3 3/8 inches, which was fine.  These barrettes fit my hair great, they fit my head nicely too and there are no fussy fastener details that could snag my hair. I especially like the way I can easily twirl my past-the-shoulder length, 3 1/4 inch pony  tail circumference hair, double, or even triple, it up near the top of my head and cinch the doubled or tripled up hair into the barrette. (My hair tripled is close to the maximum capacity for this barrette.) Preparing to slap on a shower cap, go for a windy hike, or safely work around moving machine parts has never been easier.  I plan to order an extra set for my sister who has very thick hair.  These barrettes are strong and are not made of that flimsy metal that bends and causes the barrette to slip or fall out as happens with some of Goody&#x27;s 3 inch tortoise shell covered barrettes that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order came promptly and was packed well. All in all a great purchase.</li>
